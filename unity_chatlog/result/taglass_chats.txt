 xsinick_laptop: I know redhat releases are EST based.  I would assume Canonical are using GMT though?
 linuxdemon: synaptic or apt-get remove "programname"
 Mac102250: Have a look at /etc/gdm/custom.conf
 Mac102250: The file I gave you controls automatic login.
 /etc/gdm//custom.conf
 Mac102250: I would change AutomaticLoginEnable=true to false
 cordoval_: you might have to do gnome-www-browser as well
 cordoval_: I'm not sure, but maybe you can pick chrome in the Preferred Applications gui?
 cordoval_: System Settings
 click on your name in the top right of screen
 err I'm sorry on the power button
 bottom entry
 cordoval_: There are some videos on youtube people have posted
 cc11rocks: Try looking at http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html  You could make a clickable icon that way.
 xsinick_laptop: I know redhat releases are EST based.  I would assume Canonical are using GMT though?
 tripelb: That's a dvd.
 META-W is also an option for changing windows.
 freeman_: You don't
 IceWewe: apt-cache show packagename?
 n-iCe: you'll be able to access the full 4 GB with a 64 bit os.  You can't w/ a 32 bit os unless it supports PAE.
 Vorenii: sudo vi /usr/share/empathy/empathy-chat-window.ui
 fcuk112: glxgears is a terrible benchmark
 fcuk112: but the numbers are probably capped at your vertical refresh rate.
 naiden: vim-minimal is installed as vi I believe.
 fcuk112: no idea then.
 naiden: it'sa stripped down version of vim
 PovAddict: The default environment is gnome.. How is that less supported?
 PovAddict: Unity is simply the windowmanager.  When you use compiz insteda of metacity is it not still gnome?
 gogeta: To be fair most of the peopel I've seen that said they were leaving gnome were going to xfce... Guess what toolkit that uses? :)
 Soothsayer: I think he was saying that he doesn't use it.
 Soothsayer: I do
 litropy: 11.10
 xsinick: lol switching to Fedora because of video driver troubles is probably about the3 worst move you could make.
 zombor: dd doesnt work for ubuntu images.  use netbootin
 zombor: new one to me.  I've never had any luck dding ubuntu images
 amd64 covers amd and intel.  ia64 is Itanium
 ezrafree: cd is a shell builtin.  try sudo bash
 carandraug: I didn't know that.. maybe he can do something about alt-f2 this dev cycle :)
 carandraug: fair enough :)
 pfifo: scrot
 I've used Linux for 18 years and I don't think I've ever done an upgrade.  Better to do fresh installs.
 russell--: logout and select classic from sessions
 rickyrick: apt-get install default-jre
 russell--: it's a drop down box at the bottom of the login screen
 Chaoss: I was just about to type something up to explain it, but thought to myself "Why reward that behavior"
  Maddogm apt-get -d dist-upgrade
 doodle: try sudo blkid to find the partition and then sudo mount sdwhatever /dos where sdwhatever is the nae you got from blkid
 thegoodcushion: only you can answer that question
 doodle: "sudo blkid" gives no output?
 is there a line that says anything about fat or ntfs?
 doodle: can you post the output of sudo blkid to a pastebin?
 thegoodcushion: I believe it's in experimental
 thegoodcushion: gnome3 that is
 ok
 doodle: type this sudo mount -tvfat /dev/sda11 /dos
 doodle: then it's a;ready mounted..  your data should be accessible in /dos
 doodle: ohok gotcha.  sudo umount /dos && sudo mkdir /media/dos && sudo mount -tvfat /dev/sda11 /media/dos
 doodle: you might have to edit /etc/fstab as well.  just change /dos to /media/dos
 halpbatman: boot up from your windows 7 dvd, enter the recovery console and type bootsect /nt60 and then sys /mbr
 halpbatman: that might be one command instead of two, not sure.  I just have it wrote on a postit note for helping other people.  I don't use windows :)
 halpbatman: no clue.  If there is, I bet google knows.
 doodle: that's correct.  you could always unmount it as root and then use nautilus to mount the drive.  That soundslike what you want.
 doodle: I'm not sure.  Sorry I don't have a better answer.
 ytaews: did the md5sum of your download match the posted checksums?  If so try burning your cd at a slower speed
 MJBrune: I see no reason why it wouldnt
 doodle: I don't think you need to assign a mountpoint at all
 doodle: that's fine.  you should still be able to click on it in nautilus and easily mount/unmount it
 ytaews: that's not good and it sounds like you've alraedy tried any advice I might have to offer.
 Spaz_Dynamic: are you using the sun jre?
 Spaz_Dynamic: java -fullversion
 Spaz_Dynamic: although with a fresh install you should be runnin openjdk I believe
 Spaz_Dynamic: yeah hmm I dunno man.  It should work.  You could always try sun java
 Spaz_Dynamic: probably better for minecraft anyways.
 Spaz_Dynamic: It should be in the repos if you enable the partners repo
 Scarra3: probably depends upon the size of yoru monitor.  Ity doesn't fill a 24"
 mello: I wouldn't honestly at this point gnome-shell and unity both feel incomplete and neither seems to have the upper hand in functionality.
 mello: you could always just use gnome classic for this dev cycle and hope gnome3/unity are better later this year.
 thegoodcushion: It would probably suck.. competition is good :)
 mello: ratpoison
 solofight: netstat -ltp should tell you if anything is listening on the ftp port.
 jooseyjoose: man split
 jooseyjoose: that should be able to break it up for you
 Robert__: http://www.ehow.com/how_4836283_repair-mbr-windows.html
 ddddddddddd: I know chkconfig can be used to enable/disable services which is what you seem to want.  I'm not sure what the "ubuntu way" is though
 SoulRaven: loader.conf is a BSDism
 SoulRaven: you don't.  That's for FreeBSD
 SoulRaven: It should be loading it automatically if it's supported.  I'm not going to tackle this because I'm going to bed.  I just wanted to fix your BSD problem :)
 Lesterwood: I have no trouble with fglrx or the oss drivers in 11.04
 pong
 !ask | hasan
 a month ago is forever when you have 6 month dev cycles :)
 Vustom: try java -jar /home/vustom/Vustom/Ubuntu/Games/minecraft.jar
 Stryker: I have compiz on vinyl
 lumbert: digital camera?
 yigal: try installing vim-gnome or just vim  The vim that ships by default is pretty stripped down
 eiriksvin: I disagree.  That's asking for a support nightmare, and support is one of the few ways CAnonical makes money.
 spicytaco: I'm guessing that you're behind a proxy
 spicytaco: apparently so, and this really has nothing to do w/ ubuntu support.
 spicytaco: http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#proxies
 harushimo: You have to have th esdk to use the plugin
 It's much better if you help people in channel instead of through PM because a: People can verify if you're BSing and b: other people might have the same questions.
 Atomicspin: Check under Power Management
 Atomicspin: Some people are reporting success in this thread by booting with nomodeset option.  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1730314
 cb-linux: Gnome 3 autocreates workspaces as you need them.  I'm not sure that you can set a specific amount.
 hroi: which java
 hroi: should say /usr/bin/java if you do
 cb-linux: Compiz cube requires compiz which is mutually exclusive with gnome shell.

 Sharpshooter761: Sure you can.  I middle paste all of the time.
 Sharpshooter761: The problem you might be having is that their are actually 2 clipboards under X
 Sharpshooter761: One that stores stuff that you use ctrl c ctrl v on and one that holds the last highlighted text.
 furous: telinit 5
 celthunder: It will work, but it might not start X :)
 kindofabuzz: boot in single user mode and edit /etc/group
 m0ksha: sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc and choose sda as your destination
 fizyplankton: I've never had an issues doing it, but like cheapie says theoretically you could fry your MB.
 fizyplankton: Amen.  I think it goes the wheel, sliced bread, screen
 floodplain: sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
 floodplain: or ttf-liberation which has an Arial lookalike
 TrentonAdams: There's always a chance, but I wouldn't hold my breath
 TrentonAdams: GnomeShell will be an option in 11.10
 TrentonAdams: CTRL-L
 TrentonAdams: No.  Was the same in 10.10
 TrentonAdams: That I do not know.
 TheYellowGTO: screen
 TheYellowGTO: run the program under gnu screen
 slyrus: Have you looked through http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/ ?
 killer_:  gnome-system-monitor
 inimeg: They didn't have much of a choice.  Gnome2 is dead.
 jack123: Well If Mandriva was working w/ your hardware, that's a pretty good choice.  openSUSE is also a good choice if you don't wanna use Ubuntu
 RavenhursT: How did you create the USB?
 Herbs: That may have been true at one point, but that's like saying Suse is still based upon slackware.
 amitush: Hello
 amitush: I've never tried it, but there are some results on google for that card and ubuntu

 chaospsyX: I believe he left to go boot the live cd.  I haven't noticed him log back in

 He said the filename for natty 64 bit livecd
