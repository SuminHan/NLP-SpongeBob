 Ubuntu 10.10 is telling me EVERY 5 MINUTES to update to Natsy!
 How do I tell it shut up? :)
 Hi all
 If I want to update a package, what is needed exactly?
 sorry I mean, a package in ubuntu is quite old.  I want to make a newer version of the package, and get that into ubuntu
 pfarrell_: I get that error too, and came to ask the same thing :)
 pfarrell_: yes
 Riddell: are the GB servers down?
 Skei: I'm currently trying just "do-release-upgrade"  and that seems to work
 pfarrell_: read Skei's reply?
 Skei: where is that option to select the fastest server?
 After upgrading to 11.04, I find that the kernel crashes about once a day
 is this a known problem?
 coz_: who on earth reinstalls from fresh every 6 months?
 coz_: seems like a huge waste of time
 coz_: I've also noticed that my wireless connection is much weaker.  I don't know if it's related to the crashes
 coz_: thanks for replying
 ablaze: not so easy :-/
 ablaze: if you do "iwconfig", do you see your device?
