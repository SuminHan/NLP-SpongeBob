 HELP!
 why can't I use alt tab to switch app, where is compiz config
 where do I re-enable Ezoom?
 thanks for your help launching ccsm. Reverted to Ubuntu classic
 could not get <super>+<button4-5> to zoom-in-out in compiz ezoom while using Unity
 Unity loaded a huge band of icons to the left but that many and no labels is quite useless
 missing autoloading of sound modules snd-hda-intel, snd-ac97-codec, snd-pcm. Has to load them manually and restart pulseaudio after login-in
 gnome-volume-control crash whenever I engage a speaker test
 compiz ezoom mouse tracking default to an insane 40ms giving sloppy zoom mouvments
 compiz ezoom default to no zoom shortcuts
 I'll give Debian testing a try tomorrow, too much problems with Natty
 where can I get the correct french/french 105k euro layout. All layouts available are false
 fucking wrecked french keyboard layout can not get the sharp symbol anymore
 where is the sharp symbol on the new fr layout?
 !french
 hello, I get wrong keyboard layout for French azerty <alt> characters. Can you help fix this?
 !fr
 wrong keyboard layout in french, can you help?
 serene, yes so?
 serene, yes, the french layouts are there, the problem is the disposition is wrong confirmed by preview
 serene, no. The layout is wrong for all the <altgr> characters
 serene, <altgr>3 on main should give a sharp symbol but instead it gives Â² (upscript 2)
 serene, preview of the keyboard map confirm the alternate characters are all wrong
 thanks serene
