 updating ubuntu yay, I wonder what this update breaks
 Unity bricked my laptop
 hehehe, my laptop sucks too much to run it
 so time to download and install an older version and send a nasty gram to ubunut which will be sent to the email trash can
 agreed
 is there a way in console without ther internet to disable unity?
 and bring up old gnome
 can't
 no keyboard access in login screen
 or mouse
 I have to alt prtscreen RE
 georgeJ: hrmmm, give me a minute
 no response for ctrl alt 1
 just an error saying my hardware isn't good enough and to choose ubuntu classic
 still no response
 but I can't select gnome classic
 none of that works. I get no response except by dumping myself into terminal
 I want to make ubuntu classic my default from terminal, without the internet
 thats not a promising sign
 georgej: how do I do that from terminal?
 georgej: switch to classic gnome
 or hell just run classic gnome
 no
 bah I think I'm going to migrate to suse for a bit
 rchavik: don't do it it's a trap
 rchavik: My laptop broke because of it. So I have to reinstall
 unity is not your friend
 lcb: Can't get into computer can only get into terminal
 well can't bring up gui
 unity tells me my computer sucks too much to use it and that I need to use classic, and then locks up my keyboard and mouse so I can't choose classic
 velcros: can't keyboard and mouse are frozen
 I can't exit into terminal
 lcb: system was up to date, problem has to do with intel integrated video card
 there is a fix but I can't get internet to do the fix
 shift doesn't do anything I can't get to recovery panel, is there a terminal command that I can use to do a recovery?
 ok. but I can't get into my gui
 "It seams that you do not have the hardware required to run Unity. Please choose Ubuntu Classic at the login screen and you will be using the traditional environment."
 then my keyboard and mouse lock up
 and I have to hop into terminal
 no internet
 I don't know how to do the internet through terminal
 edbian: alt prntscreen
 RE
 actionparsnip: no I can't
 intelxtreme2 integrated laptop
 so what I need is a terminal command to allow me to run classic ubuntu
 google failed
 action: warning unable to start: cannot open display
 edbian: I can't log out. no mouse or keyboard
 I can only get into terminal
 it does it automatically
 no processes found
 xorg does not show up
 so format reinstal for me
 and a nasty gram for ubuntu
