 last night someone told me to reinstall grub, now grub is broken.
 i got this error when i tried to boot http://pastebin.com/i2ZahWqH , so i was told to reinstall grub now when i boot the laptop stops at a grub_ prompt
 step21, reinstalled from liveCD and just standard layout, everything on one partition.
 i would rather not reinstall, it's been a bit of a fuzz to get everything up and running
 when booting the laptop stops and poses a grub_ prompt. can anyone help me fix it ?
