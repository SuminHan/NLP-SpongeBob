 worked fine in xp
 Hello
 again
 Sorry to be a bother but I'm having issues connecting to wifi on ubuntu 10 something with my netgear pci 802.11g wifi card. It shows a wifi symbol up near the clock in the corner with a red ! and has grayed out wired connection thing in the list and doesn't acknowledge wifi there. I can set wifi settings but at no point does it give me the option to connect.
 pindropper it's not hooked up to the internet
 but thanks for the suggestion pin
 no no it's not connecting to the router not just the internet
 I'm on a windows machine now
 The router is connected to the internet thats how I'm on
 There is nothing wrong with the wifi router it's all with the linux machine
 if there was something wrong with the router I wouldn't be able to connect on this other pc
 thanks for the suggestions pindropper
 looking into it
 wireless network is not hidden and I did try adding one manually
 it never even gives me the button "connect"
 it just gives me an add button and ok
 and a delete etc
 I never see the network listed and it's not hidden
 I don't think the wifi card works with the OS
 nope
 nope
 whats iwconfig wlan0?
 ok
 well it's almost impossible to get this machine hooked up wired
 I could try but if theres any other way
 the router is upstairs very far away from the box with no plugs and this box is built into a home theater system
 hmm you know what I'll give it a try
 I have a usb wifi stick and if that fails I'll take the time to get the computer up there
 one moment robert05ad I'll try that.
 I'm trying to get a pc with ubuntu 10 something to work with the s video port on the graphics card for a media pc
 but it just rolls
 ccllrocks do you know the specs on your computer?
 ccllrocks it would run way faster using a hard drive over a usb
 er um instad of a usb that is
 there is a version of ubuntu for older slower machines called xubuntu if I'm not mistaken (correct me if I'm wrong here )
 you don't really need to clean out a netbook
 it's fine
 just be sure to keep the vents open so the fans can work and if needed use a laptop cooling pad
 it should be fine
 as far as the netbook running slow there isn't much you can do. I'd make sure you aren't doing too much multitasking
 Well actually I'm not worried about speed I have another problem
 the s - video port rolls and is un viewable in ubuntu
 I need it to work because it's a media pc
 worked fine in xp
