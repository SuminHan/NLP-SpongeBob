 !question | yehudah

 rgr: Don't spread untruths. Chromium wasn't and isn't more accessible.
 rgr: "keyboard navigation"
 rgr: What I'm trying to say is, it's not more keyboard friendly.
 root_: What did you do?
 rgr: This wasn't about firefox vs. chromium. My only real comment was to correct that claim that chromium is more keyboard friendly and more CSS compliant.
 rgr: I think we should leave it at that, we're getting in the way of helping users :)
 sam-_-: See my previous comment.
 sam-_-: not misinforming users is a big part of being professional, no?

 Clear settings

 dury: How did you make the usb image?
 sudipta: That's an issue nvidia needs to fix ): you can use the free driver in the meantime :)
 erez: try to boot in safe mode at the login screen, or try Ubuntu (no effects)
 dury: What did you use to create it? What OS?
 eags_: Try unity --reset
 dury: Try installing it with unetbootin (search for unetbootin in software center)
 erez: Can you boot into safe mode?
 erez: how did you install? did you upgrade? from what?
 erez: Did you remove it before upgrading?
 dury: same usb stick, just use unetbootin to make it bootable
 dury: delete the one you have and make a new one with unetbootin (using the same iso)

 erez: are you using that ppa though?
 erez: try sudo ppa-purge -p gnome3

 Guest22328: Choose ubuntu classic at login

 Why mention teamviewer when we have plenty of great open source alternatives?
 And VNC isn't?
 KM0201: Did you not follow? envygeeks said himself that he needed to open ports.
 KM0201: Yes for teamviewer
 ok, ignore the anecdotes, you know better!

 VNC is much more versatile too, there are even VNC clients that work on phones.

 n-iCe: But oh well.
 RealOp: I would reccomend you backup your files and do a fresh install
 ActionParsnip: No, he doesn't need the alternative cd.
 RealOp: You don't need the alt cd.
 RealOp: the normal one is fine
 From natty onwards you can upgrade through the normal iso too.
 RealOp: do you have it burned?
 ActionParsnip: There is a new feature in the natty installer, he can use the normal cd.
 http://www.webupd8.org/2011/03/ubuntu-live-cd-will-let-you-upgrade-to.html
 ActionParsnip: yes
 He said 10.10.
 < RealOp> I have the 11.04 CD, im running 10.10, should be simple?
 RealOp: We can't help you if you mislead us.
 ActionParsnip: no problem mate
 RealOp: My advice would be to backup and do a fresh install.
 LittleRed: backup and do a fresh install
