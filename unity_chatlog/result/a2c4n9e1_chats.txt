 trying to install natty, but when i got to the partition thing, i can't set the mount point manually. any idea why?
 zvacet: i chose erase ubuntu and then i clicked advance partitioning
 zvacet: anything?
 zvacet: i see all my partition. and i want to make new partition table from scratch. i'm planing to have root, /var, /cache, /cache1
 zvacet: but when i want to make a mount point for the /cache and /cache1 i was unable to do so, due to the mount point option can't be manually edited
 zvacet: i'm making a new partitionin...like i said
 zvacet: i can use any name for the new partition, but the problem is the installer won't let me type manually. i have to choose from the drop down list
 zvacet: the options only "/", /boot /home, /tmp, /usr, /var, /srv, /opt, /usr/local can't i use other than that?
 zvacet: so if i need other partition name other than that, how can i do that?
 used to be able to name custom mount point for partition :(
 zvacet thanks
 anyone know how to use custom mountpoint name for a new installation??? please....
 somebody?
 zvacet: come on... its okay, we're all learning here. perhaps someone else know about my problem
 okay, simple problem, can i have two partition with the same mount point? how will i address each partition?
 geez.........
 how to make custom partition mount point in 11.04 owhhh ubuntu never got this stiff before.... :(
 lcb: -1 for me!
 lcb: lol. i was a happy user until natty ^_^
 lcb: i don't even get to the dektop yet. i'm still going to partition my hard drive for ubuntu
 lcb: but stuck, unfortunately
 lcb: can you lend me a chainsaw instead? lol
 lcb: i need to name a custom mountpoint for my partition, but the installer won't let me do so. any workaround for that
 lcb, its not that hard to solve. coz i did it bfore in prev version
 so, 11.04 don't let me make own mountpoint? wow. i wonder why...
 lcb, does 11.04 not using grub2?
 zcvacet: couldn't agree more on that... :)
 hmm... i think i'll reinstall the 10.10 now
 can 10.10 be upgraded using usb flash drive?
 lcb: ok let me read that first. hang on...
 lcb, ah.. costumising grub menu. nice info. thanks, gonna try that later after i'm done with basic 11.04.
 anyway, lcb,can 10.10 be upgraded using flash drive containing the 11.04 installation. coz my connection is not that lightning fast and its late nite
 lcb, that summarize why you have all those tools with you. jackhammer and that knife.
 lcb, ok, i'm gonna head straight to the crime scene now. thanks alot
 lcb, so i need to update 10.10 first. ? ouch, its gonna be a long night
 lcb. hahaha.. i shouldn't remove the partition table in the first place.
 lcb, i was erasing my partition table before deciding to install 11.04
 zvacet: yup lesson learned
 lcb: it was a proxy box anyway, and the setting was backed up. so i thought why not start using 11.04 fresh from the bedshed. :D
 lcb, i'm trying to RE-installing my pc with the new ubuntu
 don't like the term upgrading, coz i thought it might leave some mess
 but then i was wrong, its better upgrading with this realease
 lcb, the conf and package are well backed up every week bfore, so i thought nothing to worry about starting a new installation from scratch.
 now i need to install 10.10 first, make my custom mount point and update, clean, and upgrade to 11.04
 lcb, but in your oppinion, will it worth it?
 lcb, i mean, upgrading to 11.04 at the momment, with the freshly launched?
 lcb, thanks alot for the opinions.
 ny51bern: how can you be helped?
 lcb, so i got 3 unmounted partition in 11.04, how to make it auto mounted?]

 hi, i'm confused. my ubuntu can't be pinged from outside, but it can ping to outside. what might go wrong?
 escott: the other computer is connected through a router
 escott: i'm having 2 network connected thru a router, and one line from the router goes to the net, pc from net A, can't Ping to my ubuntu in net B, but my ubuntu can ping to net A pc. bot using 192.168.x.x with different subnet
 escott: i think its the firewall in ubuntu blocking outside connection to the pc. can someone help me?
 escott: i don't know how to screw around with linux iptables. but the router firewal doesn't block any connection throu it. but you CAN ping to my ubuntu from within the router,
 !iptables
 escott: what kind of detail should i presented to you.
 escott, i'm preety sure, that my router only nating connection that goes to the internet from within
 escott, because another windows pc from the net B can be pinged from netA
 escott, how to do so in ubuntu?
 ok
 thanks escott
