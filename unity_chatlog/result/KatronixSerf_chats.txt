 Hi all, before Natty came out officially I was running Beta 2 of it, I should be able to upgrade to the full version right?
 Hi all, I think I changed what my swap partition is, is there an easy way to verify the server is using the new swap partition?
 anyone?
 thanks ayecee
 how can you resize your / partition?
 (to make it bigger)
 can I unmount the / partition while in gnome make the partition bigger, and then mount it again?
