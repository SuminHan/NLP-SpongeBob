 hey, how can I make all of my function keys perform their action without needing to have fn pressed? (i.e invert the fn button). thanks!
 histo: well then i'd lose the ability to use Fwhatever keys
 smw: its just lame though
 i need two hands to do something i should be able to do effortlessly
 >:
 histo: i want the modifier to be pressed all the time
 and un-press when I actually press it
 e.g,
 if I hit f1 which both maximizes and toggles volume mute, I want mute to be _default_
 histo: like I said, then I lose the ability to ever call fullscreen with a hotkey
 histo: hmmph
 this is a very simple task
 I want to invert the fn key's function
 smw: you know, I think I'll write a wrapper that intercepts all Fwhatevery keys and maps them to my liking.
 i could knock that out in a few hours this weekend.
 histo: ....?
 smw: well maybe, but I think it ought to invert
 smw: precisely
 i'll do just that :)
 maco: no, but regardless, that's a software setting in OS X
 maco: oh it is?
 where?
 maco: oh right, that actually makes some sense
 I happen to have a mac with a mac keyboard.
 actually
 smw: maco: I think I can actually do this manually in Keyboard shortcuts
 granted i'd lose the normal Fkey function, but I can reassign most of the normal stuff
 maco: whoa, trying that now, thanks a ton
 maco: it won't, the module isn't loaded. but I guess I could digaround and see if I could modprobe it somehow
 smw: maco: think i figured it out, testing, brb.
