 ubuntu 11.04 :D
 I noticed that bununtu 11.04 is not displaying top menu of a number of apps, anyone else having that problem?
 escott: this works with some but not others
 Aptana 3 (release) is one example
 escott: ok thanks, but why firefox, I have no problems with ff
 escott: Aptana Studio 3
 escott: I did
 escott: should I reinstall it on 11.04. I had it from 10.10
 escott: hmm ok, guess I will have to use another ide for now
 zeeegis: as of today
 escott: I'd love to know that
 I tried to change my computer name in /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname, rebooted and old name still there in natty. Did I miss something?
