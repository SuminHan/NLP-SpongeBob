 I've got a weird bug after upgrading to 11.04. All text that should be displayed by compiz is missing
 Is anyone else experience a bug where text that compiz should be displaying is missing? e.g when alt-tabbing the window title should be disabled. I have two machines freshly upgraded to 11.04 with this bug
 *displayed
 Could anyone running 11.04 please alt-tab and tell me if the window titles are appearing in the app switcher correctly?
 I have three machines doing it and I would like to know its not just me
 I think there is a bug with alt-tab in 11.04? Could someone please press alt-tab and confirm it for me?
 The titles of the windows should be displayed
 but they're not
 Viking667: The window title should be displayed immediately under the selected application when you alt tab
 thelorax: I'm not running unity
 Viking667: So you are getting the title?
 Viking667: Static application switcher
 Viking667: However the problem is compiz wide
 Viking667: All of compiz seems incapable of display text
 Viking667: I have two vanilla machines display these symptoms. One ati the other nvidia
 Viking667: I'm hoping its not just me who has this bug
 Viking667: So Compiz text display okay for you?
 Viking667: Okay, phew,
 Viking667: Yeah, its very annoying. I use Scale Window Title filter frequently, its nearly useless if you cant see any text
 drhe1skt: Staying with Gnome here.
 drhe1skt: Still using it on my main desktop.
 drhe1skt: However until its stable, I'm not staying with it
 drhe1skt: I'll give it another go when 12.04 LTS comes out, hopefully the bugs will be sorted by then
 vasudan: I havent used it much recently, but I've had some good experiences with clamav
