 kwtm: how do you propose it should manage that?
 you know...
 it would be interesting to have a distribution designed to live in a chroot
 kwtm: that would be a ridiculous waste of space
 although...
 why hasn't anyone (or has anyone) made a variable-size filesystem
 you could implement it with sparse files, or simply with aggressive defragmentation
 [er, the former in a loopback device on top of a traditional filesystem, obviously]
