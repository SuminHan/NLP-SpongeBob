 hi. I've got an issue when running eclipse on ubuntu 11.04. Side sliding bars doesn't show up
 I'm also very used to changing order of the open windows butons in window list on bottom bar in Gnome but it's disabled in 11.04. How can I enable buttons sliding in window list bar?
 I'd like to ask if anybody using eclipse on ubuntu 11.04 has an issue with missing side sliding bars

 rgr: it's definitelly 11.04 isue.
 has anybody noticed that i 11.04 classic one cant slide buttons in window list bottom bar as it used to be? is there any way to enable it back?
 ohsix: I have restarted it but still no sliding
 ohsix: so that means I can't configure it in any way, except to just wait for bug fix
 ohsix: thanx I'll follow what's on launchpad
