 Hello... I've never used IRC and I'm in need of help with a headless server. Who and where should I ask for help?
 How do I private message someone here?
 My headless server running 11.04 is currently unable to get online via ethernet. I upgraded from 10.10 last night, and once do-release-upgrade finished I just went to sleep, hoping the server would be alright in the morning. Now, I have a monitor and keyboard hooked up to the server, but no amount of ifconfig, ifup, or anything will make either of the computer's connections work. Before upgrading to 11.04, I also moved my LVM root from a 3 disk pa
 ta RAID 5 array to a single SATA hard drive, which required a lot of tweaking of GRUB2 and I think may have affected boot time errors, but I'm not sure. And that's my situation.
 Can anyone help me get my server back online? It just refuses to accept that it has two ethernet ports...
 Does anyone here know how Ubuntu handles ethernet interfaces? I think it's related to avachi or something called that, but I also see network manager in my rc.d folder...
 xorpt: Transmission, when launched, shows up in the sidebar.
 I tried getting help on ##linux but it says I can't send the message or something...
 "Cannot send to channel"
 I registered I think and I still can't send to the channel.
 pylix: Yes. Use mkfs.
 How do I manually bring up an interface?
 Hi, I'm looking for some help cross-compiling for a mips system. Is this a good channel to ask, or is  elsewhere better?
 Datz: I'm realllly new to irc. How do I search channels on here?
 Datz: thanks
 So after upgrading the server from 10.10 to 11.04, I get a bunch of error messages concerning message of the day.
 Anyone know how fix that?
 tortoise: AFAIK upgrading from an LTS distro always works.
 tortoise:  Or at least, it'll run
 tortoise: I can't get it with lynx on Ubuntu 11.04 server
 Is it just me or is compiz much slower under 11.04 with an ATI card?
