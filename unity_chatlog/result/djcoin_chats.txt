 Hi all, I m trying to get data from a sata disk I extracted from my older laptop that does not work anymore. Well, I try to mount it from <:de
 from /dev/sdb but that does not work
 ikonia: yeah I know, yet i dont have any /dev/sdb*
 How should i proceed to mount ther disk then ?
 ikonia: no there are partitions, I used this disk
 ikonia: does not return me nothing, i tried it :(
 Maybe there are some hardware failure
 I wont partition this disk, I will loose the data Im trying to get it back
 I guess linux is mistaken because of some hardware failure or whatever
 ikonia: no output
 the command is completely silent
 nop
 yeah
 im root
 ho no, i did specify <:de
 /dev/sdb
 sudo su
 sudo su - ?
 ikonia: http://pastie.org/1853035
 Thanks a lot
 I copy paste the syslog
 when the disk was plugged in
 Yeah, but you also got the sudo fdislk
 fdisk -l
 that brings nothing
 I guess
 terry: usb drive yes
 terry: ikonia lol it mounts itself right away
 plugin it out
 but I made it several times
 first time it does mount
 why is that ?
 ikonia: thanks a lot
