 I am using gnome-shell. When I search for applications, specific applications are listed. How do I add an app (custom script) to that index?
 tried putting it in /bin and restarted session, but that didn't help
 ActionParsnip: How do you make a launcher in gnome-shell?
 ActionParsnip: Or unity for that matter?
 ActionParsnip: THANK YOU!!!!
