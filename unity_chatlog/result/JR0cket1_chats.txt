 @vibhav - installing from a USB stick is much faster than CD..
 Rehan: try it out using the Live image first and see if you like it and it all works...
 Rehan: If you need to add a lot of packages, install Ubuntu onto a usb stick rather than your hard drive and then you can install what you want without issue
 Rehan: a good 4 GB Usb memory still will run Ubuntu 11.04 well for testing your hardware and save you over-writing you current system
 elzoog: If you install Ubuntu on a Usb stick, then it wont have the installer packages - you could add them, but I personally would do a reinstall and perhaps grab the package list off the usb stick and take a copy of everything in /etc
 Unity looks and works much better than Gnome 3 shell...
 Zavior: there is no longer a different image for desktop and netbook - hence the name Unity :-)
 Zavior: as of 11.04
 Zavior: if you are on 10.10 I'd go with the desktop version
 nmvictor: usual irc chatter, not missing much :-)
 nmvictor: The release team is in the UK, so I recon around lunchtime, early afternoon UTC+1
 nmvictor: thats just a guess... nothing official..
 jiltdil: no more than in 32bit :-)
