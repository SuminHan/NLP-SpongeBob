 Hello, I have a problem installing 11.04
 I put Ubuntu on an USB drive with unbetbootin
 And when i try to load it up I get a really messed up screen
 fuzzy pixels and white squares everywhere
 Not sure what to do
 Anyone have any ideas or need more info?
 Is there any way to boot the Ubuntu installer in a low graphics mode?
 Thanks
 It's just something I'm used to using
 Is there a better alternative for USB installs?
 shcherbak, Ah, well my laptop isn't running Ubuntu
 shcherbak, Alright I'll try that then, thanks
