 It depends, on my router I do need to open up the ports for teamviewer because I refuse to enable PnP on my router
 KNUBBIG: for some people it can use the "skype work around" to avoid firewalls but not on my network :P
 Buddhacz: Oh I got teamviewer to work, I was just saying how I have to manually open up the ports on my network, just adding that some people might need to (mostly people with locked down networks like mine)
 VNC isn't as easy as teamviewer, with teamviewer it's nothing more than login and press a button (almost literally)
 KM0201: I have to open up router ports because that is how I designed my network. Not because I don't know what I'm doing...
 KM0201: Because I don't think all proprietary software is bad? I never have and I never will. Free is free but I don't mind paying.
