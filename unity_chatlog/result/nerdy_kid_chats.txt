 Guest34634: I used the CD to upgrade, and it wiped my server and all my apps.  Booting the CD and selecting upgrade is NOT equivalent to distupgrade apparently...
 apt.ubuntu.com links such as this one: http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/brukkon  give my a "You dont seem to be running Ubuntu" error.  I am using Chrome, anyone have any ideas?
 never mind, its a bug apparently...
