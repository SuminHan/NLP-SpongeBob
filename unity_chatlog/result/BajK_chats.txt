 what i dont understand is: is there no standardized API or something for graphics/resoluiton settings? In Windows no matter which driver you use (and I doubt they are open source) you can manage them from the exact same spot (at least the basic functions) without problem, in Linux with the proprietary drivers you always need to rely on those shitty tools they bring with
 tensorpudding: as I said: in windos no matter which driver you use, you can change screen resolution and everything by using the Desktop settings while in Linux you always have to rely on the tools the driver makers provide
 stupid apache2 -.-

 -.-
 cheddars: I think you can install ubuntu directly from the live cd
