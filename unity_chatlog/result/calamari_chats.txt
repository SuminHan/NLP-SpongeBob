 hi. it seems to take about 15 minutes, once I've disconnected, for the system to realize I've disconnected. can I change this timeout?
 bite-android: swap is used to supplement your memory should you run out..
 bite-android: memory, as in ram
 bite-android: then you're probably okay without it, but if your apps ever use more than 2gb of ram, you'd run out of memory at that point
 bite-android: yes.. basically a very slow form of ram
 bite-android: I currently have 1gb of ram and 1gb of swap.. so with your ram only, you have as much memory as I do :)
 bite-android: you can also use a file as swap space, so if you find out you need it later, you can still do it

 hi.. I did /etc/init.d/ssh stop .. and then pkill'ed sshd.. and sshd started running again. the only way I could stop it was by renaming the sshd executable. what is causing this?
 ZzTribble: thanks.. that gives me a place to look!
 kusanagi: nah dude.. this happened all the time.. one release you couldn't even edit the menu
 Silentmyst: you could try cat on the mmouse device and see if the kernel is seeing the events
 Steela: *mouse
 Silentmyst: don't pm please
 Silentmyst: open a terminal.. cat /dev/input/mouse0
 Silentmyst: might need sudo for that
 Silentmyst: so you're seeing the gibberish when you push the buttons, except middle thumb?
 Silentmyst: maybe those are a different mouse device like mouse1, 2, 3?
 Silentmyst: I meant, try cat with the other files
 Silentmyst: yeah
 Artarian: if something was working for you, why upgrade?
 Artarian: you're experiencing the new features lol
 Artarian: but seriously.. that's why I'm running a frankenbuntu of kde3.5 and lucid
 Silentmyst: k.. well that was my only idea. basically those should be showing whatever linux sees
 Silentmyst: however it's possible that the additional functions are in a different device as well that I don't know about
 Silentmyst: there are a number of /dev/input/event# devices in mine
 Silentmyst: yw.. btw is it usb?
 tripelb: picasa works fine in linux btw.. it's a hellish mix of wine but it works
 gonzalo: what is this ROOT program.. thats the key here
 WindowNumOne: you need to grant your user account permission
 WindowNumOne: patience, I'm looking
 WindowNumOne: it's in your preferences or admin under users and groups
 WindowNumOne: there should be a cdrom group and you need to add your user to that group
 dijonyummy: usually not much difference
 dijonyummy: they might resolve dependencies differenly
 dijonyummy: to get a list of packages in some sort of installed or not fully uninstalled state, use dpkg -l
 WindowNumOne: sorry, I'm not running Gnome.. ask for help on how to get to the Users and Groups settings
 WindowNumOne: then go to groups
 WindowNumOne: you should have a cdrom group
 WindowNumOne: is there a cdrom group?
 HyperShock: he's trolling
 WindowNumOne: then that is fine the way it is, don't change it
 WindowNumOne: is there a dvd group or cdrw or something liek that?
 WindowNumOne: doubt it unless you hgave more than one cd drive
 WindowNumOne: you were wanting to use k3b, right?
 WindowNumOne: actually, wait a sec.. I have an idea
 WindowNumOne: do you know the name of your cd device.. like /dev/...  ?
 WindowNumOne: don't add that
 WindowNumOne: okay that's not right but I'm going to take a guess.. open a console and type ls /dev/sg*
 WindowNumOne: sudo ls /dev/sg*
 whattt
 WindowNumOne: you typed the original command wrong
 WindowNumOne: it should be "ls /dev/sg*" ... no quotes
 openbees: okay put in a cd that already has data on it and browse it .. then go to the console and type "mount" (no quotes). tell me if you see /dev/sg0 or /dev/sg1 in the list
 openbees: sorry typo
 openbees: wrong person
 WindowNumOne:  okay put in a cd that already has data on it and browse it .. then go to the console and type "mount" (no quotes). tell me if you see /dev/sg0 or /dev/sg1 in the list
 WindowNumOne: yes
 wobblyonions: kerep in mind that shuttleworth had some fight with gnome devs and so next ubuntu won't have gnome at all
 Jordan_U: true: In April 2011 Mark Shuttleworth announced that Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot would not include the classic GNOME desktop as a fall back to Unity, unlike Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal.
 WindowNumOne: just look in the list and find the info, no need to paste it
 thanks for correcting me.. I am glad to hear that I am wrong about Gnome in 11.10
 Steela: are you the same and that WindowNumOne guy?
 Steela: I don't see a mounted cd or dvd in that list
 Steela: all I wanted to know was the name of your cd device .. it is probably /dev/sg0 .. lets just guess
 Steela: pastebin this: ls -l /dev/sg* /dev/sr*
 Steela: that looks good then. and you said you were already in the cdrom group.. well I don't know at this point. I can get you working in a "wrong waqy" if you just want to burn
 Steela: if you run "sudo k3b" you should probably be able to burn
 KM0201: it told him permission denied.. I used to get that all the time until I got my permissions sorted out
 KM0201: but if he just needs to burn something he can use sudo and get it done
 KM0201: it's not the right solution, but i can get him going in a crunch
 KM0201: I'm pretty sure you need to be able to access the /dev/sr0 (etc) device in order to burn.. and the permissions are root.cdrom.. so either root or in the cdrom group
 Steela: did "sudo k3b" work to burn your cd?
 Steela: it'll run it as root
 Jordan_U: if you wnt to take over and help him, go ahead
 Jordan_U: there is nothing wrong with using sudo to run a program
 Jordan_U: and I haven't kept up on the grpahical sudo of the week
 okay well I don't want to get banned for helping so sorry Steela you're on your own
 Jordan will help you
 btw your ubtu command never sent me any kind of link
 lol that's funny.. I guess I never thought about that.. if .ICE got messed up I'd just fix it
 well good to know I guess
 Steela: I guess your command now would be gksudo k3b
 wdbl: I was thinking about that the other day ... actually with /usr/src. if a regular user had write access to /usr/src.. a malicious user could fill up the partition /usr . I don't know if that is THE answer, but just a possibility
 wdbl: if it's just your system you could also change the permissions
 MoleMan: it means it detected a directory and you didn't use -R
 wdbl: I'm not sure either
 wdbl: cool then. I just hacked mine with chown username.username /usr/src   .. defininely not the best practice but it worked for me :)
 Steela: ok
 Steela: I thought I said to use gksudo because they corrected me.. guess you missed it
 Steela: but still.. the program should have loaded
 Steela: well did k3b load ?
 Steela: did it work to burn?
 Steela: so it still complained about permissions
 Steela: oh cool.. guess k3b got smarter since the lasty time I tried that hack.. lol
 Steela: I want to see it here, 1 min
 Steela: so it gives the warning and lets you close the warning. does it then let you burn?
 Steela: good luck with your probs, I'm out for a while
