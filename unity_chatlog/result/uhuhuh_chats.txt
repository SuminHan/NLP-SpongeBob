 hello. How to configure 11.04's application panel?
 Hello, how can I configure my application panel? I want to delete some items from it.
 Hello, I installed a windows software with wine. But after I remove it, some icons still left in my system application menu of unity panel. How can I delete them? I'm using 11.04 now. Thanks
 Juest: What do you mean? irc channel #ubuntu+1?
