 Hello, folks. I've just updated to 11.04 and kinda dislike Unity. I've installed gnome-shell, but now I'm having an issue with .ICEauthority, I have both chowned the file and chmodded it to 777. Still getting the error, what should I do next?
 I'm having an issue with .ICEauthority, when logging into the gnome-shell it says it cannot update it. I've both chowned it to myself and chmodded it to 777. still nothing
 Unity is bad.
 I'm not making a complaint, just a remark.
 Not related to Unity, no. Unity works just fine
 I've had some problems installing gnome-shell, but I think I've fixed it now
 Oh, I'm still having problems with my .ICEauthority file after installing the gnome-shell. I've chowned it to myself and also chmodded it to 777. It still complains that the file cannot be updated. Deleting it does not work either. What could I do next?
 I'm getting an error when trying to login, "Could not update ICEauthority file /home/gjiglau/.ICEauthority". How could I fix this?
 janolap1: try checking out .bash_history in her home folder
 ActionParsnip: That doesn't solve the issue, nor did chmod 777, nor deleting the file. I should mention that I've just installed gnome-shell after upgrading from 10.10 to 11.04

 drMike: If you are having problems with SSH not starting at boot. Try checking if /etc/init.d/ssh is executable
 janolap1: My suggestion would be to backup everything you have and do a complete reinstall
 drMike: SSH not starting? Doubtfull
 drMike: You could always listen on all interfaces and filter the interfaces you want out by using iptables
 Yes, you should have your interface in /etc/networking/interfaces. I'm not positive but it would be best to check
 milen8204: You could replace the UUID from ActionParsnip with the path to the partition you want mounted
 m4k: I think you need samba to resolve windows machine names
 m4k: Do you have connectivity with the machine, does ping work?
 m4k: Either add a line in /etc/hosts to add an allias to that machine as ActionParsnip suggested or isntall samba.
 m4k: See http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/nmbd.8.html
 hatchetjack: That's ubuntu's new replacement shell called Unity
 !unity
 rpk: sudo netstat -anl
 drMike: Can you see any messages related to sshd in /var/log/messages?
 rpk: What port is your service listening at?
 rpk: The service on port 7001 is listening however the 9099 one is only listening on ipv6 localhost
 rpk: If the service on port 9099 is running under a JVM, I recall there is a problem related to ipv6 sockets not listening on ipv4 aswell as configured
 rpk: I think the issue is related to this bug http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=560056
 rpk: If you search google for "bindv6only" you mght be able to find out more about your problem
 rpk: Ofcourse it works on localhosts, since the service on port 9099 is listening to the localhost ipv6 address only. The service on 7001 is listning on 10.140.179.32:7001  aswell, yes
 Artarian: Ubuntu is perfectly awesome, just not Unity
 rpk: If netstat says tcp6 and listens to a ipv4 address that means thats a ipv6 socket with ipv4 fallback afaik
 rpk: So a telnet/nc to 7001 from outside should work
 zepherin: shift+alt+1
 zepherin: ctrl+alt+1 sorry
 rpk: You only telnet to test the connectivity not to issue actuall commands, unless you want to talk HTTP
 rpk: Telnetting to 9099 from outside will probably not work since the service is only listening on localhost, its quite simple
 zepherin: Ctrl+Alt+ F1 sorry, yes
 zepherin: CTRL+ALT+ F1 trough F8 should cycle you trough different console screens
 zepherin: Is that not what you wanted?
 dejan_: Read the 11.04 Ubuntu Manual
 enav: You linked to an empty 1px x 1px image.
 For people having problems with Unity, you can switch to the gnome-classic shell. More info here: http://scottlinux.com/2011/03/05/ubuntu-11-04-change-from-unity-to-classic-gnome/
 zepherin: Do what?
 rpk: That means it is listening on all itnerfaces. Including outside ones
 zepherin: Can you not access the gnome login screen?
 paste netstat -nl please
 rpk: Paste netstat -nl please
 rpk: Thats an Unknown paste id
 rpk: The machine should be accepting connections on both port 9099 and 7001 now
 rpk: You should be able to establish a connection to port 9099. However you might get disconnected almost instantly when connecting with telnet
 Is there any news on Nvidia Optimus support?
 iceroot: Awesome, when is it due to release?
 iceroot: Allright, thanks. Will it be able to switch without rebooting? If so, that would be great!
 As a developer, whnat would you choose? Unity, Gnome3 or KDE?
 Giles: Unity is not something you enable. You can choose to use it or not, at the login screen
 Hello folks.
 I'm having problems booting the Ubuntu 11.04 CD. Modprobe is returning an error with an exit status of 0x0009
 arsenall_:  Same issue
 How can I see the full stacktrace of an error during boot? The system crashes afterwards so there is no way of reading the log files.
 bullgard4: The 11.04 live cd is throwing the error during boot. I think its failing to load "nouveau". I'm pretty sure I cannot make any additions to the CD.
 Dr_Willis: Thank you very much, that seems to fix the issue. However , will this cause me any further problems?
 Dr_Willis: Awesome, thanks for the help
