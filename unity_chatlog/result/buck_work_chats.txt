 How do I disable Unity and go back to the standard Gnome UI?
 Well, that was an odd lag spike.
 Not sure if you guys got my question the first time, so I'll be bad and repost it: How do I disable Unity and go back to the traditional Gnome UI?
 Ahhh, got it. Thanks lubuntu, xangua
 Well, one problem solved, way too many more to go. *sigh* I'm back in Ubuntu classic, and nothing works on my second monitor.
 I get the top and bottom bars, and my desktop, but no window manager, no widgets (they all crash and won't reload)...
 Applications I launch there won't get focus so I can't use them...
 So does anyone running 11.04 have a fully-working Seperate X Server configuration? (Nvidia card) I was using this in 10.04 and 10.10 with no issue, but 11.04 has totally broken it.
 I'd be a lot happier if they hadn't broken seperate X server dual-monitor mode while they were busy "innovating"
 How do I disable Compiz in 11.04?
 Ahhhhh.
 Time for another logout then. Thanks, cheapie.
