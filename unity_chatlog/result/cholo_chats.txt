 i have been using each alpha and beta.
 i spoke with gnome2 developers at MIT last week

 and gnome3.2 will have on-screen keyboard (for you [and i] with tablet pc's)
 eigba: its a great shell.
 then +ban list in #ubuntu is quite facist.
 they do
 its great to download.
 dist-upgrade is not required
 sorry, is not working
 ToeKutter: Gnome3 does not run in VMWare on Fedora Beta and Ubuntu Beta
 Its not Unity.
 do i need to change any sources for upgrading beta2 to official release
 *sigh*
 i dont see any notifications for Final Release
 when i do dist-upgrade and re-check via Update Manager GUI
 should i select the source "proposed Natty"
 -c right?
 dddYeah
 hmm
 I have used Alpha nd Beta etc..
 I am on Beta2
 Hmmph
 do you think it has changed a bunch?
 hey evdvelde : do sudo killall bluetoothd ; bluetoothd
 i think this bug will get fixed soon.
 Monotoko:.
 ok
 evdvelde: yeah there should be some changes via PPA
 i had some issues with Broadcom 2.0's
 (which is unacceptable)
 evdvelde: no, just look for a patch/fix
 ScreenIssues: Use the function key + Fx key
 evdvelde:  it is not a kernel issue.
 i think it is a userspace patch
 hmm
 bkerensa: change the source
 i use use an Internet2 downloader
 use ubuntu.media.mit.edu/ubuntu
 they do not have torrent repos
 bkerensa: Classic will be phased out next 11.11 release
