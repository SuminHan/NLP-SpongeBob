 I need desperate Ubuntu help
 I'm having some severe video driver issues
 I installed a driver for my ATI card last night via command line
 And, being a noob
 I want to know how to remove it
 As it broke EVERYTHING
 I'll remember to do that, sorry.
 It's a terrible habit of mine
 I don't know if it is or not
 I don't think it is.
 AH THERE I WENT AGAIN
 I downloaded it as a .run file, made it an executable, installed it, and then everythings broken <_<
 I'm only a few days into Ubuntu, a fresh install isn't out of the question, but I've had so much flipping trouble with my graphics that I might just switch distros
 Or go back to my cold, lonely Windows 7 installation who hides at the bottom of GRUB
 ATI Technologies Inc RV770 [Radeon HD 4870]
 I tried the driver recommended to me from the driver manager
 But it still breaks everything
 zvacet, I already tried to do it with that. Also, it breaks as in I can't use dual moniters, can't play any game, can't do anything graphical
 Ok, I ran that command
 Sure, take your time
 cheapie: I'm getting "No such file or directory" with the first command
 cheapie: Got errors on every single one of those commands.
 cheapie: Alright.
