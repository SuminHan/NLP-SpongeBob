 Hi, I just switched to Natty today and I've noticed that when I switch between viewports/workspaces in Classic, my docks and my panels all move instead of just my windows, like they did in Maverick. How can I change this?
 anyone know how to lock down docks/panels when switching between viewports/workspaces in natty? In Maverick, just my windows moved
 oh, does anyone know how to disable the floating scrollbars in 11.04?
 Hi, does anyone know how to make windows avoid docks when maximized/opened? I had it set up this way in Maverick, but upon reinstalling Ubuntu to Natty they appear under the dock instead. I am using Compiz and AWN.
 Hi, after switching over to Natty, my AWN dock no longer seems to have space reserved for it at the edge of the desktop. When I open or maximize windows, they go under the dock. How can I change the settings so that they avoid the dock? I use Compiz
