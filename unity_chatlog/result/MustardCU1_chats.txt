 Is it possible to run an error check after login?
 @Dangr Gnome, Unity, or something else?
 it's okay
 @dangr_ i don't use Unity though, sorry
 @Pascalcmoi recovery kernel?
 @Pascalcmoi I would update and hope something fixes it.  It's all i got, sorry
 @Pascalcmoi reinstalling 10.10 would also work, of course as long as you know that works.  Just make a new partition and copy anything you need from the 11.04 Ubuntu over to the 10.10
 Is there anyway I could run this without sudo? sudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=30 it needs sudo to access /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/config though
 Newb_ no
 newb_ yes

 newb_, here you go http://askubuntu.com/questions/22946/how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-of-gnome-3

 KM0201, i never did
 KM0201, they asked for it so i gave it to them
 KM0201, well Gnome 3 works

 Newb_, didn't work for me but once Gnome 3 was gone Unity was working again
 newb_k
 cheeguy, like?
 cheeguy, if your not already plug that computer into the internet using a wired connection and update.
 cheeguy, also check for additional drivers
 KM0201 Unity is basicly Gnome for Ubuntu 11.04 but well... isn't Gnome
 gah, sent it to the wrong person!
