 Help!  Whats the new keyboard command in mythbuntu 11.04 to bring up the applications menu?
 Alternately, whats the keyboard command to start up the virtual mouse?
 No love for those of us  with mouseless systems, I guess.  I can't even use alt-f2 to open a terminal!?!
 Is there a new list of keyboard shortcuts for 11.04 somewhere?
 The only shortcut I can seem to get working in mythbuntu is alt-f4 to log out of the system.
 ping check, is my irc working at all?? :)
 Thanks Inphernal.
 I'm a sad narwhal today I guess. :(
 I'm wondering if I screwed up the install over keyboard shortcuts not working... Is it abnormal for them not to be?
 Guess I've got to figure this one one on my own... :(  thanks for your ti,e
