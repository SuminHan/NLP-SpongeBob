 Soooo.  After upgrade to 11.04, all my cifs mounts that I had to list in fstab (instead of as parameters) due to mount.cifs getting annoying 10.10, are being mounted on startup by mountall
 despite them *not* being set to automount
 is there a way to make it not do that, besides my current hack of a script swapping fstab after boot?
 BlaDe^: platform dependent addons have a long history. usually they were windows only, requiring some enclosed DLL
 BlaDe^: wasn't uncommon for suckiness like, oh, my laptop's fingerprint scanner, to have a firefox addon that was basically a dll + a thin JS shell
 BlaDe^: sooo, on ubuntu side, fingerprint-gui had no integration w/ firefox master password. ah well.
 ttist25: still under Places in Gnome "classic" :)
 which makes a much better use of my large monitor :-p
 ttist25: select it on the login screen
 ttist25: there's a dropdown at the bottom
 komodo169: I'm 50/50 lemming :)
 komodo169: on my laptop I find it a bit more useful
 but not on my 1920x1200 desktop
 komodo169: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/648180/comments/25 - me being "eh"
 Sooo. yeah. why has ubuntu decided in unity that it needs to mount all my cifs windows shares from my fstab?
 result is mount-all hanging endlessly and prompting for passwords I haven o desire to enter
 (at least until I started swapping fstab after boot)
 s/mount-all/mountall/
 er. not in unity, in natty. sorry.
 Cajun_Lan_Man: ehm. lots of FOSS games out there, and the ones I care about work in Wine
 Cajun_Lan_Man: my preferred FOSS games are Wesnoth (TBS), Spring (RTS) and Hedgewars (TBS/Ballistic)
 Cajun_Lan_Man: games I've tried in wine lately are portal, some korean MMORPG my lil' bro plays, and spore (ick)
 Cajun_Lan_Man: all convinced me I'm happier w/ FOSS games :)
 Cajun_Lan_Man: portal 2 is fine in wine. Spring is better than starcraft, but starcraft works in wine too
 Cajun_Lan_Man: no clue about rift
 arvut: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=20882
 Cajun_Lan_Man: for doing windows tasks at work, I just use VirtualBox
 Cajun_Lan_Man: I have windows and OSX hooked up over synergy2, as well, but I often use virtualbox due to more flexibility in machine configurations
 oliver_: try gnome classic with no effects? :)
 oliver_: also. there was a recent fix disabling some intel thing
 check for updates
 oliver_: er. you have same problem in classic with no effects? (using metacity)
 myf: if you mean the UI, you perhaps mean the integration with your desktop theme colours...
 myf: you can disable that, or install a firefox theme, or tweak it w/ a personna, whatever.
 oliver_: there was an intel driver update recently. refresh update manager
 myf: one other weak possibility is if you are experiencing actual glitches, could be due to a bug in your vid card + gfx accel - might want to turn that off if it is enabled
 myf: about:config  layers.acceleration.disabled - try setting it to true
 Is it just me or is tab completion absolutely useless on 11.04? - like, if you're trying to dig down a long directory tree.  Like. ls -l /v<tab> yields "/var " so you can't do /v<tab>/li<tab>/cl<tab>
 you have to keep hitting backspace and correcting
 does anyone know where the bash settings to fix this behaviour are? :)
 odinsbane: hm. maybe only mine is screwed up
 odinsbane: if I type /v<tab>  it completes with "/var " instead of "/var/"
 llutz: thanks
 llutz: that looks like exactly the bug
 llutz: and unfortunately I need acroread since workplace loves signed PDF docs
 llutz: I already did. that's why I said thanks ;)
 MethedMan: how about FireMath?
 MethedMan: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8969/
 MethedMan: there's also mathjax.org
 http://www.owlfolio.org/uncat/acceleration-stop-const-distance/ - uses it here
 frag4now: if you aren't seeing that stuff, perhaps your window manager isn't running?
 frag4now: try classic with no effects at login
 frag4now: might be compiz is crashing
 frag4now: window manager, not file manager :)
 12:17 < nemo> frag4now: try classic with no effects at login
 frag4now: oh... eh. type metacity --replace&
 compdoc`: eh. not quite. I like some parts of it, but not enough to put up with it :)
 compdoc`: for me it was an. "eh. that's kinda cool, but gets annoying fast" :)
 frag4now: not sure what you me
 an
 insanity99: that's not the issue for me.  is more about what it prevents one from doing
 insanity99: I went on a bit about it in the unity sucks bug, so no point in rehashing here
 MethedMan: I know.
 MethedMan: that's why I said firemath first
 did you read that part? :)
 baggar11: yes. irritatingly counterintuitive, but use middle mouse button
 baggar11: that shortcut reallly sucks on laptops, where it isn't exactly easy to hit both buttons on the touchpad
 baggar11: I usually resort to spawning the new app w/o using the dock
 Pici: huh?
 MethedMan: you mean from MathML to LaTeX? :)
 MethedMan: and why would you want to do that?
 MethedMan: I expect most tools out there have the exact opposite goal
 MethedMan: latex is presentational, not semantic
 MethedMan: mathml can be rendered presentationally
 MethedMan: there are plenty of tools to render latex to mathml, but the other way around is rarely desired
 since mathml can be rendered just as well as latex, only has actual semantic content
 MethedMan: used to be what people used
 MethedMan: and if you are generating equations, there were editors to support it
 MethedMan: if you have no problem generating the equations though, seems silly to output to latex, since mathml can be rendered just as well
 but has actual useful content
 MethedMan: or if you are more used to latex, you would find it easier to generate, that way. but if you are, you would not have asked for an editor
 MethedMan: http://www.mathweb.org/wiki/LaTeX
 http://www.mathweb.org/wiki/MathML
 oh. come on. floodbot. that was so not flooding OR using enter as punctuation
 stupid floodbot... can't handle fast typing apparently, or pasting of URLs. one of the two
 MethedMan: mathml is just XML. it can be rendered in anything that can parse it
 it does not require a web browser
 MethedMan: I know I have to repeat myself. but you aren't reading what I link you to. please read those 2 links
 I hate retyping stuff. esp in here where it spams the channel and gets me yelled at
 MethedMan: the 2nd link. read THAT one. before asking more questions
 MethedMan: the one that explains MathML
 12:42 < nemo> http://www.mathweb.org/wiki/MathML
 MethedMan: I typed that just immediately after the other link, FFS
 ok. I need to stop spamming this channel w/ irrelevant stuff
