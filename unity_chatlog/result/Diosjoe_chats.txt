 Can anyone help me with me gfx issues
 Bloublou,ive been running ubuntu fine, until i updated to 11.04. After upate it booted nicely with the new design. But after first reboot, it loads into old design, though works without glitches, unless i log out, then the gfx screws up
 if i login again, through the gfx mess, i might be lucky to have the new design back up, with no glitches, but still if i reboot it goes back
 Neosano, so your saying format, install straight to 11.04 instead of updating
 Neosano, well i guess thats what happend
 Well, ill format and reinstall it soon
 though i must give PROPS to all devs
 on ALL improvements
 i already love 11.04
 scorch_ i think no
 scorch_ if this installation was aborted under operation, at some random point you have stopped the process,i dont think the can compare the builds and fix the errors
 Like if your installing a game or something else scorch_
 if you plug the power, it messes things up
 Scorch_ where you updating or installing from scratch?
 tauntaun tried googling, Itunes linux
 scorch_ ok, then i would really say, better get reinstalling from scratch
 scorch_ how many GB data you want to save?
 scorch_ how about using the live cd and taking copys of anything you want to say,
 yes
 scorch_ put in your ubuntu and boot in live, copy your files,etc external
 scorch_ yes isee no problem in that
 scorch_  what do you mean, music version
 oh no
 But there is loads of linux audio tools, etc audiocity
 maybe prologic or cubase supports linux
  swatto - Yes
  swatto - from .DK i downloaded from a 50MB line and got in the start between 15-45 KB/s and then in the end came to 150-200 but only a litle
 its not your connection, its routing + alot of people getting data fra the ubuntu network
 Many updating, downloading images, getting drivers, fixingetc
 ;)
 Nice scorch
 Im going to buy a touchscreen monitor now that unity works this great
