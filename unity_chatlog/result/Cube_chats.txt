 i want to automate a python job, but when i use cron to run it from some directory, the filenames in the script don't work anymore, like when i have "f = open('asd.log')" it doesnt open it in the script directory, but tries to open it in the cron directory, where it obviously does not exist. how can i execute a script with a custom working directory?
 how can i execute a script with a manual workdir?
