 cordoval_: you mean the "genie" like effect when minimizing? that is a compiz effect, but i can't tell you the name of it at the moment (running kde)
 ddddddddddd: look in system settings → startup & shutdown
 MohammadAG: that's why i always use the torrents :P
 MohammadAG: oh, touche. lol
 personally, i still think they should have a "open new instance" option when you right click an icon on the launcher... at the very least :)
 yeah that's the other thing. i don't get what's up with the systray whitelist. at least they allow you to add "all" to the whitelist
 unreal_: if you want to see dependencies, you can find the package in synaptic package manager, right click, choose properties, dependencies tab
 unreal_: oh, i forgt the command line, if you're interested: apt-cache depends <package>
 uh.. yeah, what llutz said. sorry
 stix: log out and select ¨ubuntu classic" as the session
 Vhozard: you can install unity-2d after installation. apparently unity 2d will replace gnome as the fallback version for 11.10
 zakwilson: canonical decided to enforce a system tray "whitelist," blocking any applications from having a systray icon if they're not whitelisted. to allow all apps to have a whitelist, run this and then log out and log back in: gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist "['all']"
 zakwilson: yeah, i *despise* it myself
 oh and zakwilson, just so you know, some apps on startup may not show up in the systray if they're loaded before unity finishes loading up, so you'd have to close it and restart it. i'm having this problem with keepass
 dusf_: i've been having similar lockups happen to me fairly frequently, usually related to compiz glitching out. so you can't hit alt+f2 and type in: compiz --replace?
 dusf_: the default unity desktop forces compiz to be running as far as i know. what you may want to do is install the "unity-2d" package to get unity without compiz effects
 dusf_: well "compiz --replace" is only if it bugs out again, and it's not a guaranteed fix. that will only help if it's caused by compiz crashing on you
 dusf_: can you use the gnome desktop? from there you'll be able to install unity-2d
 compiz --replace will restart compiz, which is helpful if it crashes. but if it's not working in the first place, it won't be of much help dusf_
 dusf_: yes, so can you log into the gnome desktop at least?
 dusf_: and if you install "unity-2d" can you use unity without compiz effects?
 dusf_: you'll bring up a terminal and yes, sudo apt-get install unity-2d
 dusf_: to get back to gnome, log out and select it as your session before logging back in
 dusf_: there's a little power icon in the top right. select it, and then log out
 alt+f2 brings up the run dialog. did you mean ctrl-alt-f2?
 if that's the case, ctrl-alt-f7 brings back the GUI
 compiz --replace will only help if things lock up again, and it's caused by compiz. after installing unity 2d, you'll just log out, select your user name, and select unity 2d from the sessions list at the bottom
 compiz --replace won't do anything for you in unity 2d though dusf_, as compiz isn't used in the 2d version
 heh good luck
 n-iCe: install "compizconfig-settings-manager" and find it in system settings -> compiz settings -> scale
 tbruff13: gconftool-2 --set "/apps/metacity/general/button_layout" --type string "menu:minimize,maximize,close"
 tbruff13: but maximized windows will still have them on the left
 gnome's still there. it's in the sessions list in the login screen inimeg
 uberfrau: i was having that problem as well. 64 bit ubuntu installation?
 uberfrau: yeah, i don't have an explanation for you, but it has something to do with firefox + the latest 32 bit flash plugin. i fixed it with a FF extension called flash-aid. you can either disable "npviewer tweak for 64b system with 32b plugin" or use have flash-aid download the latest 64 bit flahs preview. it'll also keep it up to date
 either solution worked for me
 yes uberfrau
 it's under tweaking options uberfrau
 uberfrau: and if it doesn't work, i know of a couple people including myself that have had success with the 64 bit flash preview
 cool, np uberfrau
 well... that's bad
 uberfrau: you can restore the original version of flash with the flash plugin in software center. first you might want to try the 64 bit plugin if you haven't though, unless that's the one giving you issues
 uberfrau: i have to head to bed though. i'll let others take over. sorry i couldn't get you to a final solution, good luck :)
 yeah, xubuntu 11.04 ships with xfce 4.8
