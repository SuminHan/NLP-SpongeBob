 Hello all.. I tried to upgrade from Maverick to Natty and I got the following error towards the end: dpkg: parse error, in file '/var/lib/dpkg/status' near line 569 package 'shotwell':  duplicate value for `Depends' field E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)
 Now I can't install any packages
 help?
 $ sudo dpkg -P shotwell dpkg: parse error, in file '/var/lib/dpkg/status' near line 569 package 'shotwell':  duplicate value for `Depends' field

 now I'm getting this after running apt-get install -f:  E: Could not perform immediate configuration on 'python-pyatspi2'.Please see man 5 apt.conf under APT::Immediate-Configure for details. (2)
 should I just format and start over with narwhal ?
 I've never once upgraded ubuntu successfully :(
 maco: I didn't either
