 Squall5668, taglass...You've both been tremendously helpful. Thank you.
 Hey guys, new guy here. So deleted a user and now the damned machine keeps trying to log onto the deleted user, and I get stuck on a screen showing nothing but my desktop backgreound. So what am I doing wrong?
 Anyone? C'mon, I need some help here.
 When I turn on the computer, it tries to log directly onto the deleted user
 BrumDart: I clicked the admin tab and went down to the very bottom and clicked "User Groups" or something like that
 Oh?
 taglass: How do I edit the file? It skips and goes straight the the deleted account, and I'm unable to do anything.
 Oh
