 Is anybody here available to help me get an application to build?
 ...anybody?
 bob__: Have you checked in your home folder?
 bob__: Maybe. I have no experience with that.
 You know, I'm still waiting for help...
 Hi. Can anybody help me with building an application from source?
 Roasted: Yes, Ubuntu has software RAID. It's available from the alt CD.
 Hiexpo: It's a program called Skyscraper.
 Roasted: Nope.
 Roasted, I'd recommend LVM if you can use it.
 Roasted: I don't know. Maybe someone else can help you. As for the 2nd question, it's in the partition setup step. Yes, it asks.
 Hiexpo: All sorts of GTK errors at the make step. Lemme get an example.
 @hiexpo: What's that?
 Hiexpo: Just a sec then...
 Hiexpo: Here's make's output to stderr: http://paste.ubuntu.com/602578/
 Dusf: Select "ubuntu classic" when logging in.
 fizyplankton: Have you tried rebooting? That always fixed it for me.
 Hiexpo: I'll go check that.
 fizyplankton: I don't know of anything else to do...
 hiexpo: The readme included with it is for an old version that used configure and jam instead of cmake and make. I tried following the (newer) online readme.\
 traskers: What's the error?
 hiexpo: It uses CMake instead.
 traskers: I don't really know. I told you to share that so that others could help you more easily.
 fizyplankton: Your motherboard can be damaged if you do that.
 fizyplankton: You can try a USB keyboard, if you have one.
 hiexpo: I have an ATI radeon HD 5770 with fglrx installed.
 hiexpo: I also forgot to mention that the video card issue is with the older "Alpha" versions on the front page. The development version (which I'm trying to build) doesn't have those issues. (It has a different graphics engine called OGRE instead of Crystal Space. Also, I do have OGRE installed.)
 balr0g: I think you might actually have to reinstall tar.
 balr0g: I think 7-zip can uncompress it, if you have it installed. Also, you can uncompress it on a different computer.
 tortoise: Have you tried Wine yet?
 balr0g: It says "subprocess tar killed by signal (Segmentation fault)" in the apt-get output. Looks like a tar problem to me.
 pie_: What desktop are you using, and what's it doing?
 balr0g: "Update Mangler" uses aptdaemon as a backend, which uses dpkg, which uses dpkg-deb, which uses tar.
 @tortoise: Just install it from the software center.
 tortoise: Just install it from the software center.
 pie_: Have you tried a different option at the login screen?
 pie: More importantly, does the "Recovery Console" option at the login screen work? You should be able to run "unity --reset" then "exit" from there.
 balr0g: You can try recovery mode from the grub menu too.
 AndrewR_SM: What's your problem?
 AndrewR_SM: I can't help it, so I'll say it - Broadcom: Incompatibility at it's finest.
 hakeon_: You may want to ask the OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice community about that.
 pie_: Yay!
 pie_: What's making you so "disoriented"?
 pie_: Yep. They can be hard to see.
 pie_: You're using unity, right? With that dock on the left?
 pie_: It's just like Windows 7.
 pie_: It's easy to get the old look and behavior back.
 chaospsyche: ...like things getting "stuck" on the screen?
 pie_: From what I know, yes.
 chaospsyche: It's a known problem. Somebody on the forum had it.
 chaospsyche: Is Flash player up to date? That is what was causing the other guy's problem.
 chaospsyche: OK. I can wait.
 tbruff13: What's wrong?
 tbruff13: Can you run sudo aptitude install compiz-core and see what that recommends to solve it?
 chaospsyche: I don't know why. It just does.
 chaospsyche: Most are, some aren't.
 tbruff13: Did it say anything else?
 chaospsyche: Well, you can try.
 tbruff13: Did you run it in a regular terminal?
 tbruff13: I don't know what's going on then.
 vasudan: What's the file called?
 balr0g: That doesn't look good. I'm not sure what happened.
 vasudan: Try sudo apt-get remove avast4workstation
 tbruff13: The first question: well, you can try. The second question: I don't think that's possible yet.
 chaospsyche: Select "Ubuntu Classic" when logging in and you should be fine.
 tbruff13: What?
 chaospsyche: You should be fine then.
 chaospsyche: What kind of artifacts?
 chaospsyche: Try Alt+F2, then type 'compiz --replace' As for openbox, it's a different window manager.
 chaospsyche: I just wanted to let you know that Openbox works best with the Fluxbox desktop environment, at least for me.
 chaospsyche: Try 'metacity --replace' to turn off effects and see what happens.
 tbruff13: Well, that's strange... IDK what to say about that.
 chaospsyche: Try restarting and select "Ubuntu Classic (No Effects" at the login screen.
 chaospsyche: Try logging in, but select "Ubuntu Classic (No Effects) in the drop-down box first.
 noobiest: What's wrong?
 chaospsyche: What is it doing now?
 chaospsyche: Do you have a LiveCD that you can try?
 chaospsyche: Do you have any proprietary drivers (fglrx, etc.) installed?
 tbruff13: I don't know what's going on in your case. Sorry.
 chaospsyche: Does jockey pop up any notifications?
 noobiest: Can you try that and tell me if it wants to remove packages?
 chaospsyche: It's the "Additional Drivers" thing.
 vasudan: I also recommend ClamAV.
 chaospsyche: Not even when you open it?
 !pastebin | chaospsyche
 chaospsyche: Can you try sudo apt-get update, then check the additional drivers window again?
 noobiest: As long as it doesn't want to remove anything.
 chaospsyche: If there are any updates, try installing them and see if that works.
 chaospsyche: I'm sorry, but I don't know how to help you now.
 chaospsyche: There are more of us...
 chaospsyche: Yes.
 chaospsyche: Looks like a driver issue to me. If you have a 10.10 LiveCD, you can try that to see if it's hardware or software/
 chaospsyche: You can add the maverick repos and install a kernel from there. Might not work out well though.
 kjxl9: What kind of controller?
 kjxl9: What kind of gaming controller?
 kjxl9: And model, if available.
 killer_: Metacity is a window manager.
 kjxl9: It appears that that device is not supported.
 kjxl9: You can try "sudo modprobe joydev" but that's unlikely to do anything.
 kjxl9: Good. Now try "joy2key  -dev /dev/input/js0"
 kjxl9: OK, yeah...try running "sudo apt-get install joy2key" first.
 kjxl9: Yeah...I don't think it'll work.
 ngc604: I haven't, but it should be the same as a regular desktop.
 kjxl9: Have you tried the network manager yet?
 kjxl9: Good point...
 ngc604: I don't think there would be any issues. In fact, ZaReason sells that configuration.
 ngc604: It's a company. They sell computers with Ubuntu preinstalled.
 ngc604: Well, ZaReason happens to sell 3 GHz Intel Xeon servers with Ubuntu Desktop Edition preinstalled, so you should be fine with yours.
 ludican: ZaReason (zareason.com) sells computers with AMD CPUs and Ubuntu.
 ngc604: It depends on the usage. How do you want to use them?
 ngc604: You shouldn't be able to notice a difference at all then.
 ludican: Well, you could buy one with Windows and then install Ubuntu on it.
 ludican: I have found the Compaq CQ61-411WM to work well with Ubuntu.
 noobiest: I don't know what to tell you then. Can you try running it in a terminal and see what happens?
 smrz: If you're still here, I just wanted to say that you might be able to chroot into your installation and install the driver that way.
 Laggg: Have you tried --initrd or just initrd instead of -initrd?
 noobiest: I'll go check. Please wait.
 noobiest: Try "sudo apt-get install pychess" (or just any other package that isn't installed)
 parapara: I think the emacs community might be a better place to ask.
 jismlicious: What's the problem?
 TrentonAdams: Low. Very low.
 jismlicious: Hmm... try running the app with padsp.
 perlsyntax: What model card/chipset are you trying to install?
 perlsyntax: Try installing then, it might just work right away.
 smrz: Have you tried the Ubuntu Classic option?
 perlsyntax: It should. No guarantees though.
 smrz: Select it in the drop-down box when logging in.
 Wow. This is like regular tech support, but with me juggling 5 phones instead of one...It's fun though.
 TheYellowGTO: I don't think that's possible.
 slyrus: You can put in "sleep" followed by a number of seconds.
 slyrus: Yeah, it's sort of like "Hey, this thing broke" "Well, why fix it when we can tape it back together?"
 I had better leave now. I have a life too, you know...
 ifqi: Ubottu is a bot...
 Is there anybody here waiting for help?
 ifqi: Have you checked network manager?
 toph: ...what?
 ifqi: Try running "lspci | grep wireless"
 Toph: What happens when you try to log into the Unity desktop?
 MK``: Same /home: yes. Same users list: I don't think so.
 Toph: check jockey and see if there are any drivers available.
 Toph: It's the "Additional Drivers" thing.
 Toph: as Souperman said, "sudo jockey-gtk" will launch it.
 glacia: What is your problem?
 glacia: Try this one: http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Emulators/Visualboy-Advance-3469.shtml
 glacia: You should just be able to go into Synaptic and install visualboyadvance-gtk
 Toph: Good. However, you can try disabling that, rebooting, and trying again.
 Toph: You could also try "Unity 2D" and see if that works.
 nabi: It seems that the smb stuff is done by nautilus, so mount might not work. If it did, you would probably also need the 'bind' option.
 Is anybody here experienced with compiling software? I'm getting this error: http://paste.ubuntu.com/602991/
 buck_work: Log in with "Ubuntu Classic (No Effects)" or "Unity 2D"
 TheBritishEditor: What's wrong?
 TheBritishEditor: Is it a Debian package?
 TheBritishEditor: It's OK, as long as you try to remember not to... Now, as for that video driver, do you know if it was a Debian package (.deb file)?
 TheBritishEditor: Well, that's not good...
 TheBritishEditor: I'll go do a bit of research and bet back to you.
 TheBritishEditor: I found some instructions that might help. The first step is to run sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx*
 Osmodivs: Did you mean !drivers?
 TheBritishEditor: Did you run that command that I told you to yet?
 TheBritishEditor: OK. Please wait a second.
 TheBritishEditor: OK. Please run the four commands specified here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/602997/
 TheBritishEditor: That's OK. Just keep going with the others. Ignore any errors.
 ChR0n05: It's like duct tape being able to hold things together. It just does that, it wasn't programmed to.
 I wonder what's taking TheBritishEditor so long...
 TheBritishEditor: That's OK. Try rebooting and see if your issues go away.
 iceroot: I personally prefer nano, but whatever...
 belak: I just like how much easier nano is to use. I have never managed to figure out vim.
 belak: The only editor I use besides nano is emacs, and that's just for dunnet... Anyway, yeah, that's a little off topic...
 gkx: What's happening, exactly?
 !classic | AdmV0rl0n
 gkx: After or before you log in?
 gkx: Are the drivers installed?
 gkx: Well, does anything show up in the additional drivers window?
 gkx: Can you press Alt+F2 and type jockey-gtk, and press enter?
 gkx: As in nothing appeared?
 gkx: Are you typing on the computer with the problem?
 gkx: Do you have another computer available?
 gkx: Do you think you can go to that computer and chat from there so we can switch to text mode on this one?
 gkx: Try webchat.freenode.net
 gkx2: Are you on the working computer now?
 gkx2: OK. On the broken computer, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. It should prompt you for your username and password.
 gkx: I see you changed your username on me... anyway, on the broken computer, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. It should prompt you for your username and password.
 pattysmatty: This is for the Ubuntu OS, not computer companies that make computers with it.
 Fireblasto: That is not yet implemented in Unity.
 todd2: What's wrong?
 todd2: As in you can't turn it on at all?
 Fireblasto: Unity is under heavy development. It's about 6 monts old.
 todd2: Can you upload the output of ifconfig to pastebin?
 neon___: ...you can stop now...
 QuikNik: Grub2 uses grub.cfg
 !pastebin | todd2
 What ever happened to todd2?
 todd2: OK. Try running 'lspci | grep wireless' and see if that returns anything.
 todd2: Do you know what chip your wireless card/stick/whatever uses?
 todd2: OK. Can you run lsmod and upload that to pastebin?
 todd2: Here we go. 'sudo apt-get install broadcom-sta-common' might fix it.
 todd2: OK, yeah, try 'sudo apt-get install broadcom-sta-common'
 todd2: That should help.
 todd2: OK.
 RxDx: What exactly are you looking for?
 RxDx: Please Wait...
 RxDx: I don't think one exists yet. A search turned up nothing.
 Can anybody help me with errors when trying to build an application from source?
 Jordan_U: I am trying to build a program called Skyscraper (http://www.skyscrapersim.com/) on Natty, and I'm getting these errors: http://paste.ubuntu.com/602578/
 jiltdil: Right click it and select "Keep in Launcher"
 Jordan_U: I'll go read that now...
 Jordan_U: That's for the older Crystal Space versions. I'm trying to build one of the new OGRE versions. I followed the instructions on their forum.
 Jordan_U: Well, there goes the third person that I've asked for help...
 khaotik: Me? I'm trying to install Skyscraper (skyscrapersim.com)
