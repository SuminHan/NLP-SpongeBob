 hey guys...after much furore...finally able to use unity...with free mesa driver
 hi alll
 i installed natty a few days ago and installed nvidia propietary driver with jockey...but the unity session wont start..then i installed the very-small-compared-to-proprietary-driver free mesa driver(3MB) and unity just works well(though not very well)..is this a bug....why didnt the proprietary driver work?Used to work with earlier version of ubuntu
