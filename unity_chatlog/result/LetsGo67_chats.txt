 Hey room!  Ubuntu is not quite my cup of tea.  It's difficult with two monitors!  Some of my desktop icons are missing.  Can anyone help please?
 Dazzled: *Unity*, sorry, is not my cup of tea.  It's the built-in monitor manager.  i set it up so the mouse "goes" from my laptop screen to my 19' 4x3 screen.
