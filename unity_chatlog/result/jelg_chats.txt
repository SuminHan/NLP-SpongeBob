 Just installed Natty (on Dell Dimension 9150 with NVidia graphics) - does not work - the unity UI comes up but accept no input
 only works in "safe mode" it appears
 not even in "classical mode" etc
 Is there a known problem with NVidia drivers for Natty?
 Natty on my PC does not accept any input, e.g. mouse clicks etc (the mouse cursor is there but no actions)
