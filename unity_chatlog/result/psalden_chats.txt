 there isn't some channel dedicated to the gnome3 ppa, is there?
 hey folks... unity is supposed to work with fglrx isn' it?
 ikonia: ok just checking... it uses fallback with fglrx here now, so then at least I know I'm doing it wrong tm :p

 jMCg: I think a problem with the window-manager can cause that
 wasn't he using unity? would be unity --replace then I think
