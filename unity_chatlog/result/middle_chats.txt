 HELP: When i boot into Ubuntu it hangs on: 'Begin: Running /scripts/init-bottom .. done.'. I was previously suffering Black screen issues so i uninstalled Ati's proprietry driver and now after re installing it, it is hanging not even reaching the black screen stage. Thanks
 Oh yeah and if i upgrade will it insall unity?
 ah maybe i shan't upgrade then
 nit-wit: No im trying to boot in safe mode and it just hangs at the afformentioned command. there is occasionally other stuff after it like [4.7993847] firewire etc... but no it won't progress
 I am thinking of booting intoa live disc and re-uninstalling the drivers
 PROBLEM: Was suffering a black screen on boot > Uninstalled Ati Drivers > Rebooted > Re-Installed Ati Drivers > Rebooted > System hangs at 'Begin: RUnning /scripts/init-bottom ... done.'
