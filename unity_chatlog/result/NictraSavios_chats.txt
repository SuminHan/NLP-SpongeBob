 Hmm, long time no see. I've been shifted within the team, so now I have to use Windows.... oh well, 2 months then osx, then 2 months then Linux :P BUT. I still have all my linux knowledge and will continue to help :)
 Hmm, any open issues mentioned before i came?
 varunvyas, I can help
 Sengoku, Go to terminal , run "lspci | grep -i network" and paste the results to paste bin
 !pastebin | Sengoku
 varunvyas, What step is it on?
 Sengokiu, Did you check to see if its supported or not?
 Sengoku, Thats great, But thats not your issue :P Must be a regression. One sec.
 varunvyas, :P Click "Show details"
 Sengoku, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Broadcom_BCM4311_rev_01_%28ndiswrapper%29
 varunvyas, It sounds like your install went screwy. I could help you fix it for hours, butyour best bet is to backup all your data, and do a fresh install
 brb.
 back.
 Sengoku, Hmm, too complex? If you want i can help walk you through it.
 ZenGuy311, If it supports openGL , yep.
 Sengoku, Hmm, hate to say it, but yea. 10.10 or LTS will work. If you want my opinion. Unity isnt worth it yet, wait till 12.04 or mabey 11.10.
 sebsebseb, Unless your grandma. Then you dont care. Thats what Ubuntu is about. A Distro for all.
 Sengoku, Not a full, i would just format your root , dont worry about your home. (But it may screw things up, so if you want to be 100%, go for it :) )
 Sengoku, Unless you have the same / and /home partitions. The yes. Full.
 Sengoku, Back it up, If you dont have a speical harddrive or partitions for backup, DVD-DL or DVD-R work great. USB Keys break every second month for me. I have disks that have backups from when i was 12.
 Sengoku, So USB Backup = 2 months. DVD = 5+ Years.
 FoolsRun, Wait till ubuntu comes preloaded on Dell pcs. Then its windows all over again. Nobody knows there was a windows in 100 years. Cus everyone will use Linux.
 carandraug, Juest . Run EDITOR=gedit visudo
 FoolsRun, Cus then nobody will know the differance. Nobody will remember us.
 FoolsRun, Personaly... I love peoples faces when i tell them " I Run Linux, Windows and OSX on one computer." I dont wanna lose that. I like being differnt. :)
 Sengoku, Im pretty sure it was used for somthing else in 11.04.
 FoolsRun, Pretty much. Its why i became a white hat. Its why i use archlinux.
 Sengoku, On the sidebar youll see dots on the open thingys.
 researcher123, there was, its here now.
 FoolsRun, I'm selfish tbh. I've always been "the player" "the nerd" "that guy", Ive always wanted to stand out and i have the physical and mental means to do so. I also have an obsession with making things work and look perfect.
 FoolsRun, Yea i see, and agree with, your point :)
 FoolsRun, Theres only one reason i dont use natty. The application button. Way to unorganised for me. My OCD goes wild.
 FoolsRun, And i fix alot of computers each day. Me and 7 guys share a live/work space as a group of whitehat hackers for hire. We also fix computers in our spare time. When someone comes to me for a reformat job, or a system upgrade, They get the LTS.
 xsinick_laptop, FoolsRun  We should probably take this to off-topic :/ LOL i got yelled at before for this.
 FoolsRun, I havent have one person complain. Ive had a few that thought it was an upgrade to Windows.
 FoolsRun, I said "Sorry i upgraded it for you, its called "Evolution" now."
 FoolsRun, And people around here use hotmail for some reason.....
 selekta, Reinstall.
 selekta, Format the partitions and reinstall. Only way outta that one for you.
 selekta, insert your dvd/usb and preform the install of 11.04, if you dont have a install cd or usb, get to a computer somewhere and get one.
 FoolsRun, People are ignorant. Use that against them "Hey i upgraded your system to "Windows Ubuntu"
 cardamon, reboot ?
 cardamon, because rebooting makes it reload itself. It will find the ne entries then. Remember, When somthing isnt right, Reboot, Reboot Again, Google. Its called 2RAG.
 cardamon, its the first thing you should do when trying to fix problems in 90% of cases.
 selekta, Thats why you have to burn it on another, differant, workin, computer. For your situation there isnt another option.
 mrdeb, want an option or facts
 BKTech86, sudo mount (devicename) (filepath)
 BKTech86, example. sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt < mounts fisrt partition in first harddrive in /mnt. to find Device name, use df -h
 researcher123, click uprade button, upgrade to 10.10, then go to 11.04 the same way.
 BKTech86, filesystem type?
 BKTech86, Not writable yet as far as i know. Check gparted > Deviced> supported, for possible packages that may solve it, you can also compile your own kernel with support, but ive never done it so i dont know if its writable then.
 researcher123, in the updater GUI. You should find it under "System"> "admin" in the gnome menu. Use common sense to find the name, im not in ubuntu now >><
 BKTech86, Hmm. Gah, i honestly dont know.
 BKTech86, Hmm. backing up, then formating/remaking the partition. Other then that, im stumped.
 josefig, nothing to install, just watch your "power settings"
 josefig, Set them to save power and your done. If you need the path to them, tell me what version your running
 josefig, okay So use what spike bike just said. Go into regular gnome and go to "System" > "admin" > "power settings"
 mrdeb, Its like a bommerang.
 mrdeb, Anything you send comes right back cus 127.0.0.1 means "host" , or the computer your on.
 mrdeb, So if i sent a file to it, i sent it to myself. Its like sending yourself an e-mail. Same thing.
 josefig, then you need a new battery :P its not ubuntus fault.
 josefig, i wonder whats eating it ... hmm.
 tss2, Bug list hangs longer then your grandma... nvm not finsihing that.
 tss2, Jokes aside... this chat is flying faster then anything.
 josefig, Try and just let it run till it dies and time it. It may just give a wrong reading. Mine always says 0% but i have 2 hour.
 tss2, Nope, the LTS is.
 tss2, Every second 04. So 6.04,8.04,10.04,12.04
 tss2: Lts is every 4th release. so 9.04 LTS, then there is 10.10,11.04,11.10 and 12.04 LTs
 tss2: I consider the LTS an actual release. he rest are beta. And 9.04 isnt an LTS.
 tss2: sorry, typo.
 tss2: 10.04, 10.10,11.04,11.10 and then 12.04
 tss2: Bassicly, every 2 years.
 brb
 back.
 ecanto, hello :)
 AbuMaia, Canonical screwed up. Just admit it. Unity needs another 6 months and SHOULD NOT be fault yet.
 AbuMaia, Its BETA. The list of bugs proves that much.
 Holly damn. Ive been here for a hour and i can say. 11.04 is not ready...
 AbuMaia, You havent. Dont put your xp on everyone else. In a test run of 12 noobs, 5/12 crashed in within the hour.
 AbuMaia, just look at the bug list and this chat.... They should have waited another month.
 AbuMaia, didnt. I put 12 peoples.
 AbuMaia, I dont, i cant for 4 months. My job tells me to use OSX , then windows, then back to Linux. Honestly? I havent tried it yet. I was unbiased.
 AbuMaia, I shall, But i'm stunned that they would release this. Enraged by the lack of customization. An idea that ubuntu, infact all of the GNU/Linux, is build off of. And most of all, that they didnt admit "We need more time"
 spikebike, I always talk like that :P less so here. If you followed me on twitter you would see it 100000% more :P
 spikebike, I'm not even on ubuntu. I was unbiased an hour ago. My job is telling me to use OSX for 2 months, then Windows for 2 months, then back to Linux for 2 months.
 spikebike, We are Whitehat hackers for higher, to keep us from getting rusty or to used to one system, we rotate. We run on a 7 computer cluster (7 computers, one big RAID harddrive, and each has there own for our personal use)
 spikebike, hire* sorry, the chat speed and my own distraction is making my spelling suck.
 spikebike, Its a live/work space on campus :P the University gives us most of the work.
 spikebike, Saint Xairver Univeristy. Better known as St. FX.
 spikebike, Its in antagonish Nova Scotia :P
 spikebike, there isnt much of a tech unity here, personaly i do a double major in Physics and Chemistry feilds. This is more/less a hobby, but we do get paid.
 spikebike, And yea, im 17 :P i was bumped up a grade in primary/middle school.
 Oh dangit! Forgot to call my gf about 35 minutes ago....
 Uh... i g2g ..... yea... LOL.
 kz3 i will :)
 kz3 White hat hacker at your serverice :)
 kz3,  Simple, Get it , http://www.metasploit.com/download/ , And then RTM http://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/wiki/Install_Linux
 Hello Ubuntian :)
 Hows 11.04 hell going?
 deadpulse, I feel so disconnected on Arch Linux. And OSX for work >.< Oh well, id help with the helping, but... my eyes kinda hurt from the scrolling O.O
