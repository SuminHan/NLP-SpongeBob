 just installed 11.04 and am unable to run unity also I get a message "over drive" on boot but then it seems to reset and Ubutu loads. Any ideas how to fix?  Sceptre LCD 60Hz not certain what the graphics card is...
 Blue1:  nVidia Corporation C61 [GeForce 6150SE nForce 430] (rev a2)
 Blue1: yep - it worked without a hitch in 10.x but then Unity wasn't the default GUI ...
