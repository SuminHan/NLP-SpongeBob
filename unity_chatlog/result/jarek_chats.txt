 Hi
 which graphics card would work best with Ubuntu 11.04?
 I remember hearing bad things about ATI cards, is it still relevant?
 Dr_Willis I was thinking about buying a laptop with Intel GMA 4500M
 Dr_Willis what's wrong with Intel cards?
 Dr_Willis I don't need power, I just would like it to work out of the box
 scotty^: but nvidia cards would require third-party drivers
