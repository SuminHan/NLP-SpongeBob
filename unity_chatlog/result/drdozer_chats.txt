 hi - I just finished upgrading to natty and rebooted, and now I have: symbol not found: `grub_env_export´. and am at the grub rescue prompt
 what can I type into the grub rescue prompt to resurrect this machine?
 how can I get my machine working again?
 hello?? my upgrade to natty has broken grub - I can´t boot
 how can I fix this?
 misse-: I didn use the cd - I used the on-line update tool
 misse-:  ok - it isn something I can fix by typing into the grub prompt?
 error: symbol not found: `grub_env_export´.
 grub rescue>
 misse-: that´s all it says
 grrr - how can natty be released and have problems like mine?
 ThinkT510: yes
 ThinkT510: that would be awesome
 ThinkT510: HDB but I can´t remember the number
 (hd0) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos1) (hd1) (hd1,msdos1)
 ThinkT510: error: unknown filesystem.
 ThinkT510: it seems to print that for all others
 ThinkT510: oh - it prints stuff out for: ls (hd0,msdos1)/
 drdozer: ./ ../ lost+found var/ etc/ ........ boot/ ...... home/ .... and so on - looks like a unix fs root
 ThinkT510: done - nothing displayed
 ThinkT510: done
 ThinkT510: error: symbol not found: `grub_mm_base´.
 ThinkT510: ok, and it can´t be reinstalled from within grub?
 ThinkT510: thanks for trying to help - I guess I now have a 4 hour wait for the iso to download
