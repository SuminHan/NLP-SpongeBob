 im having problems during boot... ubuntu 11.04 gives me some irq problem and then cap locks keeps blinking and ubuntu wont boot... i have to reboot 2-3 times to make it boot... what would be the problem?
 DasEi: what am i supposed to look in my bios? its all in defaults...
 DasEi: it was working all ok until last kernel upgrade
 DasEi: ive done it... sudo update-initramfs -u && sudo update-grub && sudo grub-install /dev/sda
 DasEi: ill try downgrading the kernel then...
 DasEi: all there is default also...
 DasEi: weird bug
 DasEi: i installed a 64bits version of ubuntu and now i have a 32bits kernel instead???? how can i see what my ubuntu version is??
 DasEi: it says i686... im sure i had 64bits installed...
 DasEi: Linux version 2.6.38-8-generic (buildd@vernadsky) (gcc version 4.5.2 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.5.2-8ubuntu3) ) #42-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 11 03:31:50 UTC 2011
 DasEi: weird... i might be confused... ill try installing -pae then
