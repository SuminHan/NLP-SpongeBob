 I love overclocking :D
 Addictive!
 Thrill sports xD
 I just clocked a dead 1.66GHz to 3.0GHz and it's stable :D
 Like a warmachine on caffeine.
 gmachine_24 good sense, a lot of nice fans, and solid knowledge gathered from other peoples trial and horrors :D
 (and I'm not talking about fan fans, but fans)
 gmachine_24 no seriously
 I don't have any fans :D
 The kind I want, but the other kind, I have in abundance D:
 I uninstalled GRUB today
 was pretty hard for a noob like me
 I had to use a Win XP install disc
 1. boot from it, 2. Choose repair, 3. Use MBR or FIXBOOT coomand
 then it's gone
 type HELP for commands
 FIXBOOT and MBR I think
 syn3rgy not the cure for GRUB thou
