 plummerb: at login, you can choose "Ubuntu Classic"
 plummerb: ultimately, you can choose whichever desktop environment you wish.
 plummerb: i'm not sure; I have only tried the beta of Natty, and i could not get Unity to work correctly.
 kanuha: your desktop's theme settings will determine the color/shape/etc of the login screen
 kanuha: have you tried downloading gdm2setup?
 kanuha: i'm not sure if it is in the repos, but it is on launchpad
 kanuha: :/ sorry friend, no idea about that.
 kanuha: you can always download & make the source
 kanuha: very painless
 Dr_Willis/hhjjff: the android emulator is basically a VM
 keithclark: in a terminal window "locate <searchterm>"
 Juest: 11.04 just rolled out, this is the place to be.
 keithclark: just try ' mame ' as a searchterm
 nathan1111: you can still purchase a physical CD, but the free delivery service has been halted as of 11.04
 geh... lack of nvidia drivers in 11.04 is killing me
 spikebike: i have 270.41.03 working correctly in 10.10, but i see no drivers listed in 11.04
 Barsuk: gnome2 is "turned on" as well as unity
 Barsuk: you want gnome 1.xx ?
 Hi Guys, i'm testing a nVidia Corporation G92 [GeForce GTS 250] video device in 11.04. 3D acceleration is not working, and it does not show any available drivers in "Additional Hardware". On startup, the screen flashes as Unity attempts to load, but using "PS -aux \I can run OPENGL applications, but they are extremely slow. Any suggestions?
 s/ using "PS -aux \/ using "ps -aux | grep unity"
 rgr: where did i say intel?
 Guest71298: 6GB
 Guest71298: as well as 1GB video memory
 rgr: there is no driver listed in the "Additional Drivers" list
 IdleOne: where can i see a list of supported cards?!
 IdleOne: roger that.
 Glowball: "Classic" != "10.10"
 Glowball: lack of video card compatibility is the one i am running into now; even in Classic mode, my 3D acceleration is toast ( yes, i have checked for drivers )
 a distro upgrade is supposed to improve functionality, not break it.
 rgr: since 8.04
 ohsix: it has succeeded in driving me away from the project.
 cooladmin: neither of those are valid release numbers..
 trailoryo: go to #winehq with that question
 Calif: yes, be careful with your upgrade
 Calif: burn a LiveCD, or create a VM and test thigns first
 Calif: i only warn because i have had several thigns break ( including my 3D acceleration )
 DosAmp: that's normally the best way to do things.
 Calif: startx

 byrnejb: there is only really one way to know for certain.
 byrnejb: why, doing it, of course.
