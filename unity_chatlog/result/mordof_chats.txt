 oh how i dislike problems with grub.. *sighs* So i did the install to 11.04 from 10.10, and now grub is dropping me to a repair command line, do i need to get a 11.04 live cd to fix it? or can i fix it in my 10.10 live cd?
 ohsix: what's a busybox prompt? lol
 ohsix: ok, then i guess it's not that.
 stefg: yeah, just that grub got updated with 11.04, so i'm thinking there may be version problems
 lcb: grub tries to pop up - but fails to bring up the selectable menu
 lcb: it drops me to a grup repair commandline thing
 lcb: so it's seeing Grub is there, but can't continue
 lcb: no, but i thought it was essentially the same thing, since i've tried it in the past
 stefg: yeah
 stefg: i'm not sure i understand - grub was working perfectly before the update, i changed nothing
 lcb: alright, i'll be back
 stefg: brb
 lcb: tried.. i get this:  error: symbol not found: 'grub_env_export'.  grub rescue>
 lcb: same as if i didn't hit shift (kept hitting to make sure it was getting the right time)
 lcb: *nods* but my question is, does it have to be 11.04 live, or can i use the 10.10 live i'm on currently?
 lcb: that's how i'm here now is the 10.10 live cd
 lcb: indeed.
 lcb: does the live cd come with the capabilities to burn a cd?
 lcb: o.o is it really that big an issue to need to back those up?
 argh.. now i can't access my 1TB drive for some reason :\
 stefg: so what were you saying before? i have access to the filesystem
 ugh this is annoying
 lcb: my 1TB drive is only accessible from user 1000 - i don't really want to change the permissions, otherwise it'll mess it up for my mount point once grub is fixed. can i temporarily get access to it somehow?
 escott: ok
 lcb: i don't need to worry about that, i just want to get access to my other hard drive
 lcb: my /home is on a seperate partition to begin with, and i can move /usr and /etc to different partitions as well
 lcb: i'll do that after this is repaired
 stefg: ah, right.. 20 mins until my live 11.04 is done since it seems 10.10 is kinda risky
 stefg: and what would i be looking for in there?
 i guess i'll just wait for any more questions until i get on the 11.04 live cd
 stefg: everything mounts fine, i can access the file systems
 stefg: this is a grub problem..
 stefg: a grub configuration problem at that, because grub is still accessible
 stefg: yes
 stefg: both my /home and my / are mounted at the moment
 stefg: it is under /media/166 GB Filesystem
 stefg: as always, that's the uuid of the drive
 stefg: /media/3d8dc5b8-b2d8-4172-ac62-7b27f327cb45
 stefg: ah, can't - no root perms
 stefg: need to root into it, but i don't remember how :\
 stefg: ah, got it
 stefg: i'm rooted into it
 stefg: ah, yeah - i found that in a post here to repair it
 stefg: will this process work if i'm in 10.10 live?
 stefg: i'm worried it'll just revert grub to it's older version
 ok, got Natty finally loaded
 nowherefast: 11.04
 nowherefast: 11*
 anyone know if it's possible to dock the launcher on the bottom of the screen?
 i use dual monitor and the launcher is in a VERY boad spot!
 robin0800: it's not possible or you don't know?
 robin0800: k... i get that it matches the design - but there's glitches/bugs when using two monitors (one to the left of the launcher) ;_;
 this isawful!!!
 anyone know where i'd report bugs about the Unity launcher in Natty?
 i've got 2 that need addressing >.<;
 robin0800: i just updated to 11.04 today. if i move my mouse over to the second monitor - hover text sticks until moving back
 robin0800: in a particular manner at that too.  as well, when moving placements, instead of the anim snapping to the unity bar - they snap to the very left of the desktop (the far monitor)
 robin0800: the second one isn't quite as big of a deal.. but the first one is bugging the hell out of me
 also getting rather poor desktop performance...
 :\
 OchoZero9: ?
 OchoZero9: i mean everything is slow
 OchoZero9: ah - wasn't referring to Unity directly, but that would definately be troublesome
 running a gtx 460 nvidia - i checked Additional Drivers, and it says my nvidia driver is activated but not currently in use.  i'm running Natty, what does that mean? do i have to enable it or is it not needed?
 i'm experiencing slow performance for visuals..
 "unable to location package ccsm"
 ChronicSyncope: almost same one i have - but i'm on the fermi 1gb
 ChronicSyncope: same with mine :o
 i'm gonna try and see about that
 ChronicSyncope: portal 2 works in wine!?
 ChronicSyncope: ah
 ohsix: what would one look for in glxinfo?
 ohsix: i'm also wondering about the driver since i'm in the same situation
 ohsix: NVIDIA Corporation
 :\
 ChronicSyncope: no co-op, that's a fail.. i'll dual boot windows just for that game, lol
 ChronicSyncope: ahh i see. if you get them worked out want to let me in on how to do it? lol
 ohsix: i have the nouvou driver or w/e installed.. i'm not sure which it's using
 ohsix: k.. that's annoying, i'm getting slow response on desktop applications
 seems a lot of people are commenting on the proprietary drivers
 rpk: what's the error, and what hardware do you have?
 rpk: did some googling, there's a bunch of investigation going on about that error
 rpk: when did you download the iso for the installer?
 rpk: do you have internet access? most of the reports are listing that there's no internet access during install :\
 rpk: if you could get your logs from the error it'd be helpful
 rpk: use a live cd and check /var/log/syslog
 rpk: on your main partition that you're installing on i mean, for that directory to check
 rpk: hmm.. there should be a way to get the installer to install with debug output
 rpk: sorry, i don't know enough about this to get anywhere :\ lol
 rpk: was hoping i could at least get you in the right direction
 rpk: if you could find out how to get logs to show for when you're getting that error -it'd be helpful in resolving the problem at least
 rpk: no idea.. i'd just try re-stating the problem here and hopefully someone else will pick up on it
 rpk: yeah..
 ncg: don't ask to ask, just ask
 ncg: try not to hit Enter so much, with the amount of talking your problem won't get noticed as easily
 how do i put someone on ignore in irssi? lol
 oh hey, /ignore works, lol
 yay no more Herbs ^-^
 mickster04: i don't care :p he's been told many times he's being annoying and needs to stop
 mickster04: maybe if 3/4 of the channel ignores him he'll get the picture
 or.. just ramble to himself *shrugs*
 Strav: amd images? how would i tell if i've done that? i upgraded from 10.10
 Strav: i booted the live cd amd image..
 Strav: didn't install from it though, i ran the live from it
 shane4ubuntu: yeah, those are with unity
 shane4ubuntu: i was reading that also
 Strav: hmm, nah nothing like that happened to me. grub failed, but i reinstalled it
 superproxy: it took about an hour and a half on my computer
 yeah i had 1500 packages to install, lol
 freeman_: there's a rar pack in the repos that adds to the main compressing untilitiy
 freeman_: rar is in there
 oooh
 ohsix: i forgot i did that xD
 checkers: trying it now
 checkers: seemless mode works fine for me
 checkers: although it makes the unity bar hide forever, lol
 rgoytacaz: apparently mine are working.. i don't know
 rgoytacaz: it tells me that they're installed but inactive in the additional drivers, but my nvidia x server settings tool works
 rgoytacaz: saying the same thing to me.. and my desktop performance is sluggish, so i'm not sure what's happening with mine
 great.. emesene no longer shows up in Unity - is there a way to change that?
 i took emesene off of unity, but i want it to show again - anyone know how to re-enable that?
 even when i open it as a task, it's not showing anymore
 anyone know why a program that's currently open won't shwo up in unity?
 Psychobudgie: did you manage to figure it out?
 Psychobudgie: i have several bugs to report, i don't know where to report them
 Psychobudgie: how do i do that?
 Psychobudgie: kk,, how do i restart unity?
 looking for the link to show reinstalling Grub 2 on a new partition. the whole chroot then mount to /dev, bind mounting folders, etc
 anyone know where that is?
