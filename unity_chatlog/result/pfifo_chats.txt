 Julie972, yes
 Geet, linu and laptops have never gotten along very well, if you leave ubuntu expect to gain an intimate knowledge of your hardware and the software that runs that hardware.
 jla, try `sudo apt-get install nvidia-current`
 beoyndcr, is this consistant across all boots?
 beoyndcr, whats it spending the extra time doing?
 beoyndcr, i think you can press Fv at boot to disable the splash, or you can remove "quiet splash" from the kernel line
 jla, sudo apt-get install linux-sources
 beoyndcr, F2 (not Fv)
 allowoverride, with 64 bit, chromium, flash worked out of the box
 lampliter, with 64 bit, chromium, flash worked out of the box
 allowoverride, sorry
 beoyndcr, first time startup extras
 jla, the kernel module is going to need the kernel headers... I dont even think i can explain why... all the functions the nvidia driver is going to use, are defined in the kernel headers, without them it would be like handing a blind guy a gun.
 jla, maybe its a packaging mismatch, not that big of a bug and its probbally been reported, but if you want you can check launchpad when it cools down
 jla, you only need -pae if you have over 4gb of memory, if you dont you should consider generic
 jla, so -pae got the nvidia installed correctly in the end?
 !cn | I think its in this factoid lubuntu
 jla, np
 merther, `mount -l|grep sr0|sed 's/.*\///'`
 miles__, repos are flooded, try using a mirror
 THE-SE7EN-SINS, funny, mine was way too low
 yuskhanzab, give me a minute ill fire up wow and see if I can do the same thing, if I can Ill probbally be able to fix it, it will take me a momen t  to install wine tho
 merther, show me exactly what command your typing and the output... pastebin.com
 merther, mount -l|grep sr0|sed 's/.*\/\(.*\) type.*/\1/'
 yuskhanzab, still installing, slow repos
 Vustom, just a shot in the dark, but try making it on the desktop and then dragging it to the panel
 plustax__, firstly, go into xchat setting and disable the task bar icon. then killall -9 xchat, then start a new fresh copy
 plustax__, alerts -> enable system tray icon
 yuskhanzab, keyboard is working fine for me, perhaps you should try purging wine and then reinstalling, somewhere along the way it looks like your keyboard layout got messed up
 yuskhanzab, 1.2.2, it came from the repos
 yuskhanzab, you can still do a uninstall/reinstall
 yuskhanzab, it should mess with any settings and suhe in you home folder
 shouldn't
 aaron_wayne, it does, it just keeps saying its not

 hasek79, 99% sure it will
 "period"
 Vustom, you need to java Minecraft.jar
 lumbert, what is the error
 Ubuntu_user_, terminal is in apps, "gnome-terminal" setting are in the logout button
 lumbert, at that point in the boot process, everything is logged to the screen
 lumbert, no it wont write boot error logs to your flash drive
 lumbert, "something about live" is not
 lumbert, unfortunatly no
 lumbert, what filesystem is on the USB?
 lumbert, how did you make the USB?
 lumbert, do you have a linux system available to you to follow linux based how to's for making bootable USBs?
 lumbert, the problem is that, the initramfs is supposed to wait a few seconds for your USB device to be ready, but its not so it cant find the needed files. I recommend installing grub2 and using the isoboot method, but I cant find a good guide for it... yet
 lumbert, different machines have different USB controllers, and some chipsets are faster than others
 lumbert, this page explains how to make a grub2 isoboot setup but dosent explain how to install grub2 http://www.ubuntudoctor.com/content/blog/08/ISO-Booting-with-Grub-2-in-Ubuntu
 lumbert, regardless of chipsets and computers, the problem is that the deice is not ready
 hello, hello
 !clone | yigal virgilivs
 durando, try rolling arch
 durando, archlinnux rolling release
 lumbert, yeah
 lumbert, ahh, that makes no sense, but ill jot that issue down
 lumbert, my guess, is that usb30 kernel modules have not made it into the initramfs/livecd
 lumbert, speaking from the linux kernel standpoint, USB 3.0 is supported... in ubuntu i have no idea
 !usb3
 is usb3 suported
 my monitor broke, can I get ubuntu to just print out the tty... on paper
 Cursarion, you can boot from a iso image if you hae grub2 installed, but you need access to linux to install grub2... however the limitations of ubiquity wont allow you to install to the hard drive that the isoimage is on so you would need 2 drives atleast

 andeeeuk, you have to reinstall ubuntu
 andeeeuk, yes, nothing short of formatting will remove gnome3
 andeeeuk, yeah, "mke2fs"
 andeeeuk, it is a program used to format a harddrive partition from the cli
 andeeeuk, it works well from a livecd
 andeeeuk, no, its not possible, gnome3 replaces gnome2 stuff, you can never go back
 andeeeuk, installing ubuntu over a previous ubuntu with gnome3 will yeild undefined results, approach with caution
 !gnome3 | andeee
 andeeeuk, "safe downgrading is not possible."
 andeeeuk, PPA's are sometimes a bad idea
 hihihi100, upgrading is problematic, do a fresh install
 hihihi100, ikr
 hihihi100, if you really want to stan a chance of upgrading you have to keep your system uptodate and ease into the alphas and betas
 hihihi100, no, you would have needed to go from 10.10 to 11.04 alpha a few months ago
 hihihi100, no, not this time, i ws wrapped up in a project and didnt want to deal with bugs

 zcot, apache2 runs as the use www-data and cannot read those files due to permissions
 zcot, you can change ownership or change permissions, either will work
 idefix, try pressing shift + numlock
 zcot, depends on what you want really, theres #ubuntu-server as well
 idefix, i dont know
 Osmodivs, try pressing Q
 sandGorgon, look into using gpg encryption
 sandhu, , look into using gpg encryption

 Incarus6, ohh well in that case maybe not
 Guest21274, try leaving the password field blank
 welloonger, what if you have 32GB of memory?
 Guest21274, iwconf is far superior to network-manager and if you maste it youll know exactly whats going on ;)
 Guest21274, `iwconfig`
 Guest21274, you already have it, its network-managers back end, check `man iwconfig` for usage, expect todo some reading/learning
 XZargX, I was helping a guy last night that just installed to that board
 XZargX, actually he had 2 of them working so thats a pretty good sign
 XZargX, he mentioned slow package downloads from the repo but i dismissed it due to high usage of the repos after releases
 Guest21274, terry offered up wicd, maybe thats worth a shot, ive never used it though
 krad, if you dont want to reinstall you can chroot into the install and add upstart back
 sudo in a chroot
 krad, tack on a `dpkg-reconfigure upstart` once your nstall upstart just to be safe
 krad, what version of ubuntu are you using?
 krad, thats not a fail condition, your still ok
 brian_, that was all terry

 Ultimate_Chaos, less than absolute zero, nice
 is there anyway to disable a CPU core, or, somehow select what process run on which core
 escott, ok thanks
 acicula, will this get me my desired result of disabling all process running on any core except core 0, with the other one/three idling?
 acicula, yeah im going over docs now, just though you might know
