 Hello, I like cake.
 Is it possible to mount an .iso image
 ...and then boot it from within Ubuntu?
 tensorpudding: I'm not sure I can run that on this chip
 ...my objective is to install a new Linux install on a hard disk, to replace the existing one.
 tensorpudding: That'll mean cracking the case to temporarily attach an optical drive then.
 tensorpudding: This machine doesn't seem able to boot from USB.
 I've tried flash and CD-ROM
 nathan1111: They released it into the wild
 ...after the fact.
 Well I'd best break out the screwdrivers then.
