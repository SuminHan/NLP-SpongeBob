 hi. How can I do to have the Unity interface ?
 elxordi: I'm on a live usb persistant
 elxordi: the 11.04
 elxordi: I tried to install nvidia drivers but there's nothing
 elxordi: but there's no driver
 I can't try to instal them
 elxordi: a 8400 gs nvidia card
 elxordi: I have a x64 ubuntu. So nothing special, I just installed pidgin to chat. There was no boot screen (the one with my name). I landed directly on the desktop.
 elxordi: yes exactly
 elxordi: yes but I did a live usb persistant to test unity because I have to install graphic drivers and to reboot. Impossible without a live usb persistant.
 elxordi: I prefer to wait several days to upgrade to the 11.04 version.
 elxordi: yes, the last solution... did you install th 11.04?
 elxordi: what's the problem with your ubuntu ?
 elxordi: In my mind, I'll wait at least a month before to install it lol. Thank you for your help. ;-)
 lol
