 Every time I login, I get the same default icons despite removing them and adding new ones ( by right-clicking on apps like skype and pressing "keep in launcher.") I hope I have explained my problem thoroughly - I am a ubuntun00b. Is this just a bug, is it fixable, or am I missing something here?

 Can someone tell me why my launcher icons revert to default upon login?
 I'm using Unity
 Launcher Icons Revert to Default Upon Login
 mikinanuq er... I can't log in with root...
 mikinanuq after ctrl alt f1
 mikinanuq I already created a new unix password
 mikinanuq I don't know why I can't log in as root
 mikinanuq do I just type sudo cd /home? I did that. I types in the password and it said it was wrong.
 I just logged out of nowhere
 mikinanuq sorry it logged me out out of nowhere.
 mikinanuq you said sudo su.... what?
 mikinanuq I kind of lost you there
 mikinanuq sorry to bother... thanks you
