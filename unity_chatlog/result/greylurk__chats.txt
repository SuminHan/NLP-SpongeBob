 any instructions on how to install Oracle JDK in Natty?
 xangua - those only seem to cover maverick and lucid.
 anyone know of a PPA thtat includes Eclipse 3.6.2?
 axisys in 10.10 it has... I haven't tested in 11.04
 axisys the deb on google's site installs the ppa too
 the more I use unity, the better I like it.
 ereals It's pretty good, once you get used to it.
 axisys no problem.
 The only thing I'm not liking about Unity is placing the system preferences under the shutdown icon.
