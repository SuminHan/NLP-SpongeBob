 iceroot, when I'm in busybox the /dev/mapper/vg-root are allready here so I guess yes
 I encrypt the full lvm ;)
 :)
 iceroot, don't know
 iceroot, /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/cryptroot in initramfs looks good
 but it stay locked in here
 iceroot, I'll double check do you know the exact names of these modules ?
 iceroot, I have message in console who said : /dev/mapper/vg doesn't exist... (but I can see it in /dev/vg/root for example (vg is the name of my lvm with vg-root, vg-home, etc...) I don't have the command lsmod in busybox ! but I have dm-crypt in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
