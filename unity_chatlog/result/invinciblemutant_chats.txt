 has anyone here successfully upgraded from 10.10 using do-release-upgrade
 cholo: gnome to be phased out?
 i find it is not easy to upgrade to natty
 terminated by itself twice
 same problem?
 amanda: you have the same problem too?
 amanda: have you got the solution?
 amanda: have you got any idea from the room?
 i use do-release-upgrade
 i think natty should be renamed to nasty
