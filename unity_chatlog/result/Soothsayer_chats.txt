 launch party channel name ?
 silvery: yes it would, but I read the switch is easy.. you just pick gnome during the login screen.
 thanks
 soreau: professor, isn't that a few hours away? :-P
 Guest7243: what about it ?
 why is the ubuntu website broken ?
 Guest7243: omgubuntu.co.uk/natty/
 well.. ye some dependencies css, js files, etc are not loading
 why is the 32-bit 'recommended' ?
 true
 If I'm going to dual boot windows 7 and ubuntu..
 If I'm going to dual boot windows 7 and ubuntu, all the NTFS partitions will be available to both right ?
 So that means even the main Windows 7 partition will be available ?
 where the windows os is installed?
 sorry, back.
 I have two hard drives and I plan to dual boot Win 7 and Ubuntu.. I've heard that it's better (in terms of performance) to put both the operating systems on one drive and all data files on another
 Is there really a considerable difference?
 kaushal: ext4
 lol
 [TK]D-Fender: true. Though I'm talking about performance?
 ubuntutryout777: ok.
 [TK]D-Fender: so what locations would I mount on the other drive in Ubuntu ?
 the /home/ , /var/   ?
 [TK]D-Fender: I didn't understand this "normally Ubuntu will point them to /mnt automatically and you just click to mount from Nautilus"
 ubuntutryout777, [TK]D-Fender : my home directory should be on the data drive right ?
 [TK]D-Fender: I also want to do some database intensive development work. And I believe MySQL stores the database in /var , so where should I mount the /var ?
 [TK]D-Fender: I see. I'm just used to seeing everything in /home .. like the documents, pictures, etc
 [TK]D-Fender: So you are saying just keep the entire Ubuntu on one drive... and then use a partition from the data drive for all my data?
 [TK]D-Fender: won't that be the data drive?
 [TK]D-Fender: hmm.. so how should I keep the databases itself onto the other drive ... through a symlink ?
 I'm not sure.. if I don't mount /var to the data drive, then how do I make sure MySQL databases are actually on the data drive.
 [TK]D-Fender: makes sense.
 [TK]D-Fender: you around ?
 [TK]D-Fender: you around

 would the best way to upgrade to Natty from 10.10 is by booting into installer ?
 acicula: ye, but i've already downloaded the iso to install on another comp.. so can I reuse that? cause my nets not too fast.
 acicula: not what i meant, see this - http://www.techdrivein.com/2011/04/how-to-upgrade-to-ubuntu-1104-natty.html?m=1
 ok
 i booted into Ubuntu 11.04 and I don't get an upgrade option
 it only allows me to install it alongside 10.10
 if I cancel the ubuntu upgrade to 11 from within 10.10, can I resume it later?
 its too slow at the moment.
 jrib: but I will lose everything I've downloaded so far right? :-(
 jrib: oh, that's nice then.. its in the "Getting new packages" page.. its already fetched some 150 packages.
 jdahm: baa.. feels kinda kiddy (the interface)
 stuff is too big in the left bar.. can that be reduced though ?
 when I dual boot between windows and ubuntu, the mac address is the same on both right? My ISP's login client uses my mac-address.
 Can two computers on the same network have the _same_ mac address ?
 TerryBook, pp7_ : No I'm going to be setting the mac address manually (through some or other methods online).
 My ISP's login client is locked to a mac address!
 hmm...
 ye, true.
 bastidrazor: I do have that in place. But this ISP's login client won't be able to fetch that mac address anyway!
 DCC exploit .. wtf :-|
 Kevin`: still around? got disconnected
 I did a sharink on two separate drives to make space fo Ubuntu..but the two Unallocated spaces are not contiguous, how do I achieve that ?
 shrink*
 I did a shrink on two separate drives to make space fo Ubuntu..but the two Unallocated spaces are not contiguous, how do I achieve that ?
 if I have the Ubuntu 11 bootable disc.. isn't there ANY way for me to upgrade the 10.10 to it using it? I don't want to download all the packages all over again through the internet update
 its terribly slow.. 5 hours remaining!
 kzetts: yes, here
 very slow update
 kzetts: if I cancel .. can I resume it later? (cause ive already downloaded 800 packages)
 kzetts: at 22 kbps here
 kzetts: ok , im down to 10 kB/s
 http://i.imgur.com/1IbQU.png <-- this is my breakdown of partitions.. as you can see I have two fragmented unallocated spaces. How do I make the first unallocated space larger? (by using the unallocated space at the end)
 Right now, my  sda =  C: + FREE-SPACE-1 + D:  + FREE-SPACE-2
 I want to make FREE-SPACE-1 larger and put Ubuntu onto that.
 Can software raid-1 be setup after installing Ubuntu ?
 ohsix: my data files + mysql databases mostly
 kzetts: cancelled my update. And yes, it can be resumed later from that state itself.
 Hello71: yes
 Hello71: if you want to cancel and resume later, you can.
 I just did a few seconds ago and it gave me the message saying so.
 ok about to install Natty, bbl :)
 Hello71: no clue where
 ohsix: I should RAID-1 only my data partitions right?
 I've never configured software raid before, should I just install Natty on a partition first and then plan the raid part later?
 ohsix: no, im not looking at a substitute for backups
 crashes instead.
 I'm on the Natty live cd right now.. it has detected my wifi right thought not sound or the dual monitors..
 should I just go ahead and install it ?
 I believe the right drivers for graphic card, etc can be configured after installation ?
 ok someone please help me here. I'm on the install screen. I want to dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 7.. I created an ext4 partition and picked it during installation. Now what do I pick for "Device for booter loader installation?"
 Jon4248: I have two hard drives now.
 Jon4248: one is the one with Windows 7 and where I also plan to install Ubuntu OS... the other is for data only.
 Jon4248: ok so im picking the "hard drive" which has Windows 7.. and NOT any partition under it.
 right?
 Jon4248: /dev/sdb ATA ST... (500.1 GB)
 Jon4248: yes
 Jon4248: ok.
 Jon4248: one more confusing. I'm picking the ext4 partition which I made a few minutes earlier using gparted. Do I have to set the Mount point ?
 Herbs, Jon4248 : ok, so I picked Ext4 File Journaling System and set the mount point as /
 Herbs, Jon4248 : ye, I want to keep all 'data' files on the other disk... so that means I should mount /home and /var onto the other disk?
 How should I be going about this.
 Jon4248: no I did not! :-| *cross checks* .. no i didn't! p
 Herbs: well, I don't have any partitions.. but I have a lot of unallocated space on the other disk.
 Herbs, Jon4248 : So /home and /var go to two separate partitions on another disk?
 Herbs, Jon4248 : /var is where MySQL, etc store the databases if I'm not mistaken ?
 Jon4248: ?
 Jon4248: oh c'mon, thats unjustified...
 taglass: then it wouldn't have needed the 'lol' :)
 ok
 ok now im totally confused as to how much size to give each
 what size should each mount point / partition be?
 I had allocated 60 gb to this ext4 earlier assuming it would be the single mount point /
 Herbs: ok.
 Jon4248, Herbs: what else goes in /var ? (Besides MySQL which im aware of)
 I'm going to be mainly using this workstation for web / database development.
 Jon4248: I see.
 Do you guys normally store your data files under the /home directory? Like say documents, pictures, reports, code projects, design projects, etc?
 ohsix: Sorry if I left abruptly. What crashes where? Refresh my memory please
 Herbs: oh ye symlink it.
 ok
 Jon4248, Herbs, ohsix, taglass: So 20 GB for UbuntuOS ( sda1 with mount point '/' ),  100 GB for data files ( sdb1 with mount point '/home') , 100 GB for databases, etc ( sdb2 with mount point '/var' ) ? <--- makes sense?
 Herbs: Maybe for the softwares, etc I install?
 ohsix: wow, robustitigitation :) nice term.. hard disk crashes I meant back then.
 Herbs: ye I can spare it now.. shrink it later maybe.. plus I might want to virtualize Windows 7 within Ubuntu too.. maybe virtualbox or vmware.
 Herbs: isn't making too many partitions on the same disk getting redundant?
 ohsix: well, i distribute the odds rather :)
 ohsix: anyway, I decide to not do any software raid-1.. manually backup stuff instead.
 Herbs: ok, so final call on '/' mount point size then?
 Herbs: ok.
 i almost deleted my Windows partition... Jon4248, you jinxed me earlier!
 Jon4248: I did have 'critical' stuff backups.. but not for level 2 and level 3..
 so ye, ill be careful instead, simpler than backing those up.
 A partition can fetch unallocated space from both the left and the right too?
 Jon4248, Herbs, ohsix : For the '/home' and '/var' mount points, should I be creating "Primary Partitions"  or "Extended Partitions"
 ?
 xsinick: please, thats criticism that doesnt help anything or anyone.
 Primary
 ok
 What about selecting a swap space during installation?
 the installer is giving me a warning that I haven't selected a partition for the swap space.
 ok installing now :)
 its very thoughtful that I can use firefox during the installation.
 ok now
 this is strange
 my ubuntu installer has been stuck on this screen for like 5 hours
 "Saving installed packages....."
 how do i cancel the install ?
 Blue1: hmm.. ok
 going to
 bbl then
 my dual monitors are not being detected
 I have an XFX 9600 GT
 and once I installed ubuntu, it gave me the drivers prompt.. and I installed the driver from there.
 It's got the resolution right, but I don't see the second monitor being detected
 Feyisayo1: do you have 32bit or 64bit ?
 Feyisayo1: hmm no, then you have to use the internet update method. I've been trying it too.
 paddy_: I'm not using anything.. just installed a fresh copy
 paddy_: I have an XFX 9600 GT.. it prompted me to install some NVIDIA accelerated graphics drivers (recommended)
 (version current)
 "This driver is activated but not currently in use."
 why is it saying that?
 paddy_: there is no such option
 paddy_: should I try installing the other one?
 and then do what you suggested?
 why can't I just download the drivers from the official website?
 http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-amd64-270.41.06-driver.html
 this driver is activated but not currently in use again!
 paddy_: there?
 how do I give natty admin privileges?
 I want to delete a file in the /etc directory
 ok deleted xorg.conf
 re-logging in
 damn it
 not detecting the second monitor!
 and both drivers are activated but not currently in use
 paddy_: you around ?
 what is twinview?
 dual monitor ?
 daxroc: even im trying to get dual monitor working here
 What graphics card?
 Feyisayo1: "if you have a Ubuntu installed on machine there’s an upgrade option in the installation guide"
 you won't get that screen on a 64-bit, at least myself and a few other people didn't
 daxroc: im trying on an XFX 9600 GT
 there is an official linux 64 bit driver on the website, would that help ?
 Feyisayo1: read the comments on this post
 http://www.techdrivein.com/2011/04/how-to-upgrade-to-ubuntu-1104-natty.html#comment-193736625
 the first thread of comments
 Rehan: well dual monitor
 I'm not even sure if my graphics card is detected
 though my monitor is running at full resolution - 1440 x 900
 and unite is working
 unity*
 Feyisayo1: the one i linked you to.
 why doesn't any forum, article, etc tell you to install the official driver from the website of the graphics card vendor?
 ok
 what's Separate X screen?
 and what's twinview?
 the difference?
 daxroc: hmm.. whats that?
 daxroc: I want a dual monitor setup like on Windows 7.. where I can take windows from here to there...
 what am I looking for twinview or ... ?
 ok, now I can't boot into ubuntu!
 in recovery mode with lowgraphics selected.
 how do I rollback the graphic drivers configurations I did ?
 I second what gartral said.
 My graphics card has drivers on the official website.. it's a .run file, what do I do with it ?
 im so confused about setting up my graphics drivers
 how do I check if its enabled or not to its full capacity?
 webtrickster: you dont have to remove it
 webtrickster: just pick classic during login
 My boot is stuck at "Checking battery state...."
 and this is a desktop
 the last thing I did was configured my second monitor in Nvidia Server X Settings dialog
 wrote to config
 and rebooting
 woot! Got the graphics card working
 and dual monitor
 how do I make the Unity bar on the left smaller ?
 ok Unity is not that bad
 You just need to get use to it
 I can see a lot of potential.
 botcity: I cannot tell vouch for its performance cause im on a quadcore with 4 gb ram here.
 but looks fast
 just the unity bar on the left is ugly
 and big
 and bulky
 What's the keyboard shortcut for the launcher ?
 has Nautilus changed too?
 what is that version of Nautilus that allows me to launch a terminal for the current location, etc?
 and how do I make Nautilus more minimal ?
 remove icons, etc
 what's the SHORTCUT key for the launcher
 ?
 how do I restart Nautilus ?
 shortcut for launcher again?
 :-(
 found it, it's the Super button
 How can I 'remove' the maximize button
 its quite redundant
 studentz: ignore that
 studentz: no, i didn't say that.
 studentz: Go to NVIDIA X Server Settings
 studentz: if that dialog opens, means your drivers are installed.
 studentz: just run it from the GUI
 studentz: did you try opening the Nvidia X Server settings?
 osse: how come I don't have that tab?
 studentz: hmm..
 studentz: try the other driver then
 studentz: did you pick the one with (Recommended) while choosing the Additional Drivers?
 daxroc: get what sorted?
 daxroc: yes, its working fine now
 daxroc: ok one thing I did was this http://joeslifewithubuntu.blogspot.com/2010/12/update-on-nvidia-96-driver-with-ubuntu.html
 daxroc: and I realized that the Nvida X Server settings window has all the other configuratiosn I need to do. Like enabling the second monitor.
 brb, need to logout, login
 anyone using ubuntu tweak on 11.04 ?
 why did I read somewhere chrome was a part of this Ubuntu ?
 knick: i don't see it in the software centre
 how do I make Ubuntu (with Unity) as the default option during login?
 I picked Gnome classic once.. and it is that by default :@
 sssstavr: its not!
 how do I get the "Places" menubar option?
 I just removed the minimize and maximize button from the titlebar and only kept the close. Double clicking titlebar minimizes the window instead... looks cleaner :)
 What are good add-ons that help with a dual monitor setup?
 Like I want a taskbar in my second monitor
 its too much to scroll all the way to the left
 What are good tools to use along with  a dual monitor setup?
 Like I need a taskbar in the second monitor
 It's too annoying to travel all the way to the left to unity taskbar
 Dr_Willis: will that restrict it to that monitor only?
 Dr_Willis: then im assuming I've to get rid of Unity dock on the left?
 Dr_Willis: which dock would you recommend? I need something like the one on Windows 7
 Dr_Willis: name them again please?
 why can't I execute a file? ./crclient -u gives --> bash: ./crclient: No such file or directory
 usr13: -rwxr-xr-x 1 dayson dayson 29580 2003-05-01 21:38 crclient
 usr13: isn't it?
 usr13: crclient: 1: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
 usr13: crclient: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.2.5, stripped
 usr13: let me download and try again
 usr13: hmm.. same thing again
 usr13: downloaded from a different source too
 do you think it has something to do with me being on 64-bit ?
 how do I access the /root directory through Nautilus ?
 UserX: where is that?
 by the way, the super user in Ubuntu is the same as the username created while installing right?
 ok
 so if i need a terminal as root
 i do a
 su root?
 ye, just experimenting
 sudo su is nice
 I was running the internet upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04... during the installing process, my screen went blank.. and it kinda froze.. so I switched off my laptop directly.
 Now when I boot, "The disk drive for / is not ready yet or not present". I'm getting this at Boot.
 wtf was that?
 lol
 is ext4 file system faster than ext3?
 is ext4 file system faster than ext3?
 I screwed up my laptop while upgrading.. now it can't find the mount for /
 reformatting the whole thing
 Do I have to define swap space during installation ?
 Do I have to define swap space during installation ? Does sawp require a separate partition?
 ohsix: ye, I want to hibernate it
 ohsix: I have 3 gb of ram on this laptop.. so how much swap space?
 4 GB ?
 or shall I make it 4.5 GB in case I plan to upgrade to 4GB?
 Neosano, ohsix ok. And what file system should it use? ext4?
 Neosano: I'm creating a partition here using gparrted for it.
 ok
 Neosano: that's in gparted?
 or during installation ?
 Neosano: baa, i chose ext4
 and im already in the installer..
 Fixing recursive fault but reboot is needed!
 what is that message?
 ok, i rebooted and that error went away.
 Strange stuff with the 11.04 installer.
 Wow
 Installer crashed. We're sorry, the instalelr crashed...
 freak, what was that
 "Fixing recursive fault but reboot is needed"
 why do I get that message while it boots into the 11.04 installer ?
 Anyone experienced the "Fixing recursive fault but reboot is needed!" ?
 n3glv: yes
 n3glv: you can pick it during your login screen
 lcb: i've booted.. reformattinig it to ext3 now
 n3glv: yes
 lcb: for some reason ext4 has never worked on this laptop.
 lcb: tried it on 10.10 too.. used to not format.. this time it formatted to ext4.. but the installer crashed
 lcb: gparted
 brb reboot
 11.04 installed this time.. looks like some issue with ext4
 is it possible to virtualize my dual-bootable Windows 7 within Ubuntu ?
 so I don't have to restart to go back to windows
 Karen_m: not necessarily
 Karen_m: ye
 Karen_m: I JUST experienced an upgrade issue
 formatting my whole laptop because of it
 Karen_m: and plus, the download rate for the packages is really slow, so wait for a few days maybe?
 why do I keep getting the "Fixing recursive fault but reboot is needed!"
 after 11.04 installation, my laptop is kinda acting weird
 it doesn't boot at times.. gives that fixing recursive fault , ...
 why does Nautilus kinda get hung when I'm safely removing a pen drive!
 how do you install flash player for Firefox?
 Can I change the mac address ?
 Can I change the mac address of a network card?
 I have an executable called 'foo' at say '/opt/cyberoam/crclient/'
 so I can navigate to that path in the terminal and type ./foo and execute it.
 But how do I execute that from some other path?
 jrib, ./crclient: You can run the executable with name `crclient' only.
 jrib, in my case foo = crclient (the executable is the same name as the directory holdign it)
 mrchak, can you back them up?
 _Neytiri_, I don't think so
 mrchak, damn, I went through that too.
 mrchak, I just ran the installer all over again. Can you move your /home and data files to a separate partition?
 mrchak, I'd _really_ suggest just formatting your OS partition and installing 11.04 from scratch. Quite a bunch of people are facing odd upgrade issues.
 mrchak, are you sure you didn't run a formatted install ?
 mrchak, you ran the upgrade from within 10.10 or through a 11.04 cd?
 Sledge, navigate to ?
 anyone knows a tool I could use to capture outgoing / incoming packets from a process? GUI based preferably and easy to use.
 how do you view Nautilus settings?
 like I want the edit path bar
 how do I put an app that was not installed through a package into the programs so its accessible through the launcher ?
 anyone running gnom3 on ubuntu 11.04?
 andycc, why did you revert?
 ohsix, :-P I'm having some issues with Unity.. tell me how would I go about this? I have this java which I've placed in /opt/phpstorm/ . So I execute /opt/phpstorm/bin/run.sh to run the app... how do I make this accessible to the launcher ?
 ohsix, ye i managed to move it into unity launcher.. and it works.. but the problem is now when the app launches, it doesn't appear in the unity taskbar!
 ohsix, that's so bizarre cause how would I find that window :-|
 ohsix, why does it have to be so complicated?
 ohsix, im still confused as to what to do. I believe this is going to happen for all java programs then.
 ohsix, the application executes fine.. just that it does not show as an icon in the left unity taskbar
 ohsix, ok see I created a new "Menu Item" in the "Main Menu" dialog in the Control Centre.
 ohsix, http://i.imgur.com/doyxY.png
 that's all the options I get @ ohsix
 ohsix, ok now it all of a sudden starts appearing in the unity taskbar
 In a dual monitor setup, could some recommend a way to have a launcher/dock in the second monitor?
 Anyone installed DockBarX over Unity ?
 ActionParsnip, exactly what I want.. works well for dual monitor ?
 ActionParsnip, so what did you mean by unity on one, dock on another? (two different installations??)
 why didn't Unity factor in dual monitors!
 that's one thing that requires a lot of work and attention
 is the user created in ubuntu a part of the 'root' group ?
 rgr, my issue is this.. apache's default location for web files is at /var/www/
 how do I make that file writable by the user logged in?
 directory*
 hmm
 ohsix, hmm.. "you want to add a user to the group able to edit files there"
 ohsix, the var/www 's owner is root in the Properties dialog for that directory
 rgr, hmm.. that also sounds like a good option
 rgr, yup, I'm reading you.
 rgr: So change the apache config of symlink /var/www to go to a directory under my home directory ?
 ohsix, ye, I'm looking at those. Well, I just have one default virtual-host which I'll be using
 rgr, ye, and is shamrockirishbar.com an entry in your host file? (I'm setting up a development server here)
 ohsix, makes sense.
 ohsix, rgr: ok got it. So I'll setup a virtualhost with some dummy domain name like soothsayer.com and add it to my host files. For someone to externally access it, I'll add an alias for the external domain.
 after I make changes to my /etc//hosts, what do I have to do to activate it?
 I added a line "127.0.0.1   webly.lh"  to my /etc/hosts/
 /etc/hosts  **
 what's the shortcut to launch Nautilus (preferably with home directory opened) ?
 Just like how Ctrl + Alt + T opens terminal
 how do I put a pidgin icon in the top panel ?
 _Keepiru, drag and drop what?
 _Keepiru, and where should I drop it
 _Keepiru, its not falling in the top right panel
 besides the volume, wifi, datetime, power off
 _Keepiru, "there is the "state" located" ?
 how do I have two different wallpapers in a dual monitor setup ?
 how do I have two different wallpapers in a dual monitor setup ?
 how do I keep the launcher bar on the left visible/maximized at all points?
 I don't want to auto-hide it
 trism, thanks
 anyone on Ubuntu 11 with a dual monitor setup ?
 thevor: well yes.
 dKingston: really?
 dKingston: is that a gnome3 issue or apt + ubuntu issue ?
 Is it possible to have a Windows 7 like taskbar at the bottom (and preferably across dual monitors) with Unity in 11.04?
 Is it possible to have a Windows 7 like taskbar at the bottom (and preferably across dual monitors) with Unity in 11.04?
 victorhugo289: hmm i dont think that bar is for seraching for files
 most recently used files, then yes.
 Anyone virtualizing Windows 7 within Ubuntu ?
 Rehan: no
 sudocomm: I had that too, but I ignored it. Does the Nvidia X Server settings window open ?
