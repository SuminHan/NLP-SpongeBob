 i want to reset my desktop after my upgrade, what do i need to delete?
 i wish clicking on a sidebar icon would minimise it
 can you made the sidebar more like a traditional taskbar?
 jodlajodla, i had a similar problem, what i did was delete all the .gnome and .compiz directories
 jodlajodla, well i just logged out and in
 jodlajodla, is this an upgraded system?
 jodlajodla, did you logout and back in?
 jodlajodla, i've only seen that after i messed with compiz settings a lot
 do apps like eclipse need to support this global menu thing before their menu is integrated into the top bar?
 PythonPup, then i would imagine eclipse does have to support it
 what is really irritating about unity, if i change between virtual desktops the single full screen app doesn't get focus when i move back sometimes
 i know someone who wants to try ubuntu,  what they want is a virtual pc image,
