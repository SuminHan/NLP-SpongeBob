 hi all
 I am using gnome 2.32.1 on ubuntu 11.04 ... I am tring to replace the panel with awn. I run this line "gconftool-2 --type=string --set /desktop/gnome/session/required_components/panel 'avant-window-navigator'" .. but, on login, the gnome-panel is still here . someone could help me ?
 hi ... why ubuntu 11.04 doesn't follow gconf-editor configurations ?
 nit-wit: I set panel to avant-window-navigator but gnome-panel is still there
 nit-wit: I remove the panel entry and gnome-panel is still there
 nit-wit: thanks anyway
 someone know how could I deactivate the load of gnome-panel at startup ?
