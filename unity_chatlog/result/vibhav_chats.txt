 sarge : serge rp-filter uses the routing table to decide which source addresses are accepted through an interface. Packets will be accepted not only if they originate from the connected network, but also if they originate from a network that (according to the routing table) is connected via that network.

 <sudipta> lemme see
 <sudipta> believe Unity requires 3D graphics. So if there is an open driver that can do that, you don't require proprietary drivers.

 <h-dee> Or if unity 3d does not work then you can install unity 2d
