 I tried installing gnome 3. After a lot of hassels I managed to run it. turns out i would prefer unity . So i purged the ppa. How to get back unity ?
 roasted: so i'm stuck with lxde ?
 i have logged in from it
 roasted: also can i get gnome 2 back easily ?
 roasted: have a look at http://askubuntu.com/questions/22946/how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-of-gnome-3
 roasted: the top answer at the end of the post says how to remove gnome 3
 roasted: It says unity is already the newest version
 I ran a apt-get update and dis-upgrade
 No i get the login screen
 but no unity option
