 Hello everyone! I am trying to setup a server with two network cards. They are both recognized by ubuntu, and one is working properly as an LTSP port, but the other one will not connect to the internet.
 sakurango, I am not familiar with the new Xubuntu, but can you right click on the Application launcher and choose to edit?
 aww
 I see that I forgot to actually ask my question in haste, does anyone know how I can get the network card to connect. I have tried manually setting it up to work with DHCP, but it still doesnt do anything.
