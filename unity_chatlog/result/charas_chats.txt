 Congratulations Ubuntu. I am totally digging 11.04
 can anyone tell why "Ctrl + Alt + Numpad 7" shortcut might not work on my system?
 jrib: It should place my window at top left corner of screen but it's not working. I disabled all the compiz shortcuts so not to override.
 jrib: Yes, shortcut for placing windows
 in Unity
 thanks anyway, man
