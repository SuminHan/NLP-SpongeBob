 Hi guys, I have been playing around with compiz yesterday, and when I started ubuntu (11.04 with  gnome ) all the headers from all the windows disappered. What can it be?
 Gwibber does not load twitter messages and does not post anything.
 When run from terminal I get :
 ERROR:dbus.proxies:Introspect error on com.Gwibber.Messages:/com/gwibber/Messages: dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name com.Gwibber.Messages was not provided by any .service files
 (gwibber:3041): LIBDBUSMENU-GTK-DEBUG: Could not handle image type 6
 and for  $gwibber-service -d -o
 My gwibber does not load any messages:

 And when I it from terminal I get  http://pastebin.com/ZLTea4EW
 bullgard4:  not sure how to do that. What is purge?
 bullgard4:   ok, thanks
 Is there any alternative to Gwibber?
 Hi, is there any alternative to Gwibber?
 nutsfornatty: I have pidgin, but I need a client which will combine twitter, facebook and buzz
