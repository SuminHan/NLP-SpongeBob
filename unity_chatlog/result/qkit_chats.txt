 evening everyone
 after i updated my ubuntu t the lastest version
 all my panel go missing
 how can i resolve that?
 i cant go to any menu
 is just a desktop with a couple of icon there
 even i try right click it only give me the option create folder, launcher,document
 nope...it only prompt me for password
 errr, it dont have any option there only has a box for me to keyin the password
 ok
 BlouBlou, it only show enter password to unlock your login keyring didnt have any option below
 i believe this is due to the fact i using macubuntu, and when i doing the upgrade i forgot to uninstall it.
 hmm..possible for me to reinstall the whole xserver and gnome ?
 ok, let me try remove all the desktop environment and reinstall it. See does it help or not
 strange i manage to get my ubuntu classic running
 but how can i get unity to be running on ubuntu 11.04?
