 Hi, I am having some trouble installed FFMPEG into my command line UBUNTU host, can anyone help... it with the get apt command
 ?
 How do i update FFMPEG to the most recent... this is DRIVING ME INSANE!
 @DaGeek247 that runs an upgrade?
 What if i just want to update ffmpegj
 sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
 DaGeed247 Thanks!
 going to do it now.
 DaGeed247 Shows as the same version, i am going to remove then reinstall
 @DaGeek, strange thing is it says it was removed, but it is not actually removed
 probably why the update didn't show....
 hm.
 yes, even after it returned that it was succesfully removed
 did
 strange... could it be installed a different way?  let me look.
 the php.ini shows it as installed in /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
 if i just delete that directory and reinstall, think that will help?
 i didnt it was a different admin, but id guess suda apt-get ffmpeg
 @DaGeed trying suda apt-get autoremove ffmpeg
 looks like it si working, but i'll have to wait until it finishes.
 i believe the initial repo was pointing to deb packages.
 sort of new to this..
 zvacet well, autoremove is working onw, will try that next.
 @zvacet trying now.
 @zvacet Not working
 i think it was installed via aptitude
 @zvacet May explain the Debian packs.
 @zvacet how do i access synaptic, i only have command access
 ah... thnaks.....
 @zvacet it shows
 @zvacet can it be native to Lucid?
 @zvacet can it be native to Ubuntu 10.04.1
 @zvacet hm... removing request to remove ffmpeg which isn't installed
 but apt show ffmpeg shows me the package
