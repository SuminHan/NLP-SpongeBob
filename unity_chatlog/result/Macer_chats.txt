 i mean.. it is a simple dist-upgrade
 isnt 10.10 stable?
 actually released?
 i mean.. it is a simple dist-upgrade
 uhm
 arnauddebordeaux: might help if you said what the problem was
 and i just finished installing 10.10 server :) go figure
 Zavior: upgrading the dist is easy enough
 personally i would rather wait a month or so before i instealled 11.04
 let them iron out theones they missed first :)
 but at least all you have to do is change your apt-sources and do a dist update and you're done
 i just updated my lenny box to squeeze ... was amazingly simple
 guest345345: well. i am sure there is something messed up somewhere ;)
 unity?
 i use kubuntu for my desktops ;) if unity has something to do with xorg well.. i honestly only have my ubuntu fileserver
 which is awesome ... sure feels good to no longer be using oi
 http://lwn.net/Articles/387763/
 that's unity?
 looks like gnome with a giant menu on the left :)
 oh
 well.. let me look for a different screen shot
 Incarus6: that can not be real haha
 heh. sorry but i still believe kde has them all beat ;) but to each their own
 guest345345: i don't have a problem with kde ;) i think it's great
 Incarus6: looks the same except they used a darker theme?
 i was honestly never a big fan of gnome
 i would rather use kde or fluxbox over gnome.. something about it never felt right
 no 3D? :)
 is it 1990? heh
 Incarus6: i haven't used enlightenment in a LONG time.. but it was ok.. i didn't like its dock too much and it took too long to tweak.. plus isn't it gtk ? :)
 something about most gtk things .. they make me feel like i am using motif
 like no matter how much work they do on it gtk always seems to remind of me windows 3.1
 is e17 qt or something?
 i'm sure glad kde decided to stick with the qt route. they have done a great job of it
 intel? really?
 haha.. that is a very fair point
 guest345345: get a new artigo ;) it has hdmi out
 i am a huge fan of the little boxes
 guest345345: yeah but the artigo stuff is half the size of an internal optical drive
 uses the via pico itx stuff
 i have an older 1GHz one that i use as my local shell box/dns etc
 heh
 me too... but my fileserver is a beast.. it consumes power and spits it out
 with its 10 hard drives and its 2 opteron 285s
 i actually want to upgrade the cpus but it is hard finding faster cpus for socket 940 nowadays
 how much power does a fast i7 use maxed out?
 Wattage: 92.6W
 that is a 2.8GHz single core athens cpu for my mboard
 92W! wow
 hello
 hm. found some cpus for my ubuntu server for $50
 2.6 dual core opterons.. awesome
 i have 2 dual core 1.8 265s now :)
 that should be a good bump
 uhm... is zfs built into the 11.04 install?
 arand: hopefully some day
 anyways... bbl.. when the 11.04 hype dies down
 :)
 in order to upgrade to 11.04 server do i just change the name from maverick to natty ?
 for apt?
 guntbert: do you have a link that explains the instructions?
 thanks
 guntbert: thank you so much.
 looks like those ubuntu servers are getting a little beat up right now
 vanguard: i'm getting 40K/s ;)
 24.3kB/s
 awesome... feel like i'm on v.90
 ohsix: heh. it's ok. i'm in no big rush. ;) i have to wait for a lot of stuff to finish anyways
 ohsix: software properties? in apt?
 ohsix: i'm using ubuntu server
 ohsix: i honestly think on release day i would be hard pressed to find one that wasn't slow
 but thank you for the help. i will just wait it out.. i don't want to use the one broken mirror.
 know this might sounds like a bad one but.. in order to change the name of a grp all i do is edit /etc/group and rename the group?
 is there some way that i can make it so if an nfs goes down that users would be redirected to a secondary home ?
 i want to use an nfs for home but if it goes down i want users to be redirected to a local directory for their home (one that can be synced with the nfs with cron or something)
 hm
 i can't seem to find any information on this :( does anybody know how i can set up a user acct where it will use an nfs as its default home but if the nfs is down it can fall back on a local directory?
 ohsix: you can change those settings in fstab
 the timeout and retrans
 i want it to fall back to a different directory if the nfs hits its retrans mark
 i don't even know if that is possible tho. i've been looking on google but don't see anything that relates
 ohsix: i don't understand. it is a pretty straightforward question. if i have user home directories on an nfs and the nfs hits its time/retrans limits is there a way to get the server to fallback to a local directory
 ohsix: i was just going to set up a cron script to sync the directories every 6 hours or so
 and being that it will be a fallback home dir and not the actual home dir...i think a fallback would be better.. especially considering size constraints.. i want the fallback dir to just maintain a small amount of information in order to get a user logged in instead of being hung at logging in
 maybe even display a different motd explaining what is wrong.. but config files would be good to keep in teh fallback driectory
 ohsix: that is a start
 at the least i want the fallback dir to keep their config files from their nfs home dir
 like .alpine .ssh etc
 something that can get them on the system without having it hang and possibly change the motd explaining what is wrong
 the actual home dirs will be much larger than .files
 and dirs
 but thanks for the help. i will continue looking
 ohsix: yes
 i don't want the login to ever stop due to the nfs being down
 Jordan_U: they can still access other servers from the box... but if their home dir goes down i want them to be able to still be able to login to  a... trying to think of a proper word
 contingency directory?
 ohsix: but there are greater options having a fallback directory
 say they DO write files there.. once the nfs is back up they login and can copy them over themselves
 ohsix: that is what i am trying to avoid
 ohsix: isn't time always linear?
 :)
 i thought ntpd fixed linear problems
 ok. but you are digging too deep into possible problems.. is there a way to do it or not? :)
 a simple fallback directory is all i need
 i can figure out the problems that come along as i go alone and refine how it works
 alone/along
 anybody know where i can find ubuntu documentation on setting up coda?
 DasEi: tried. dont see much
 i was hoping for a wiki
 httpd?
 for coda? :)
 i guess coda would be a good fs to use for httpd
 ok thx
 can someone tell me why my console is so incredibly slow? X is fine but when i swap over to a console or when it boots i can literally see the screen drawing itself
 weird
 i have a decent video card.. nv240
 but when i use a console it is horrible
