 can anyone direct me to a page that will show me how to get flash + firefox + audio to work properly?
 its crackly, and it makes the sound in vlc stop.
 yeah
 i installed flash through the software installer
 hmm...no. do i just apt-get remove it?
 is the one in the repo not 64 bit?
 oh yeah, i remembereed i set vlc to use alsa instead of pulse becuase it was cracling/
 i spose i can go back to pulse in vlc, but how to i stop the crackling
 ok going to change it back now
 so i set vlc to default of to pulse?
 or*
 yep so the fuz/hiss/crackly is back
 N.B. it also pops when i adjust the volume with my keyboard

 just checking ohsix did you see my paste bin link? http://pastebin.com/9GNgCHmN
 ohsix_ should the restart have any output?
 its gone, but the volume control appears to be gone
  main.c: Unknown command: tsched=0
  main.c: Unknown command: tsched=0
  main.c: Failed to initialize daemon.
 like so? http://pastebin.com/vtcUbt8L
 re did -k and no output then re did -vvvv and got this  http://pastebin.com/s2fKxRe1
 so what should i do next
 sorry, in confused, do i leave tsched in the config file?
 ohsix: im back sorry
 yeah appears to be working. still crackles when i move the volume dial. but otherwise seems solid
 ok, done
 ohsix: i get this error when i try to run the gcc command, http://pastebin.com/aEBUTvw2
 ohsix: i got this error http://pastebin.com/NXbTULi0
 how long should it take?
 and what will the result be?
 doesnt matter il do it and il be back.
 ohsix i ran it again on a compleatly idle system and same error exactly, but it did run longer and made a bigger log file 150mg vs 790mg
 can you tell me how to do that?
 ok
 thanks for all your help!
