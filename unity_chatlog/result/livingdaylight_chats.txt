 guys: I installed wine, and I'm looking for wine configuration tool?
 Dr_Willis, yes, used to find it under applications but having trouble with the new release
 found it...
 html_inprogress, winetricks is something different still. Requires separate installation
 winecfg was what I was looking for, but couldn't remember the name, which made finding it hard.
