 My laptop sound works fine in Ubuntu including soundmenu and stuff, but when I plug in my external speakers, the sound cuts off from the laptop ones, but nothing comes out of the external ones. Any help?
 ActionParsnip, its an Advent 5411 - a bit rarer, but still uses a common-ish sound card
 ActionParsnip, OK thanks
 syn3rgy, Dont use unity is the answer
 syn3rgy, It doesnt support the notification area
 SudoGhost-Away, Install ccsm and tell me when your done
 SudoGhost-Away, paste apt:ccsm into your browser and press enter
 SudoGhost-Away, sudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager
 SudoGhost-Away, Oh OK
 SudoGhost-Away, Now open it by pressing Alt + F2 and typing ccsm
 SudoGhost-Away, Go to the unity section
 SudoGhost-Away, And I dont have natty with me, but it has a purple circle logo; easy to see
 SudoGhost-Away, No problem. Its annoying that it isnt like that by default, but oh well
 ActionParsnip: What did you tell me to do before?
 ActionParsnip: To do with my sound card, and putting something into some file. Because I lost it :P
 ActionParsnip: Cheers again :P
 ActionParsnip: I'm afraid that didnt work
 ActionParsnip: No, sorry
 ActionParsnip: I'm just adding this to the bottom of the file right?

 Hi, is there any way to get playlists in the sound menu on 10.10 Maverick. I refuse to upgrade to 11.04 until the bugs have been sorted out in a few months
 Hi, is there any way to get playlists in the sound menu on 10.10 Maverick (maybe just using the natty soundmenu?). I dont want to upgrade to 11.04
 vish, how would I do that?
 vish, are there packages or a ppa though?
 vish, so where are the packages? Any particular site?
 vish, There are no debs, so obviously I will have to compile
 vish, ?
 vish, i cant see any
 vish, I assure you its not there - in deb form at least
 vish, Hey I found it ;)
 vish, Cheers :P
 vish, Now I have to get the dependencies D:. Not a difficult task, just a tedious one
