 Any idea on my issue? I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my Sony Vaio Laptop, but it's stopping every now and then.. The whole system stops working, the mouse movces, but I can't really do anything..
 How can I stop those silly visuals in the new Ubuntu? I could do that in 10.10 from the Appearance menu
 ;/
 how can I choose to use Classic desktop? ex0a
 err... xangua
 I don't want to use Unity, it's bothering me
 Aha aha
 Oh finally!!
 Thankies!
