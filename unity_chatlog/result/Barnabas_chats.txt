 narf_, try to google your make of monitor + xorg
 narf_, you will almost certainly find a config example

 Juest, I had the same issue
 Juest, try changing the mixing method in pulseaudio
 Juest, in /etc/pulse/daemon.conf:
 change resample-method = speex-float-1 to resample-method = auto
 reboot
 Juest, must be grub OR lilo?
 Juest, anyway, you can probably make do with restaring pulseaudio
 Juest, why not use grub, its the standard for Ubuntu?
 hmm I think the grub package is more or less self configuring, to the degree, where it detects your installed kernels - I am not sure though, anyone feel free to confirm this
 Juest if you edit that one I think you changes will dissapear every time a new kernel is installed
 Juest, it produces a menu.lst file probably in /boot somewhere
 Juest : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
 Juest, remember the menu.lst is a generated file
 Juest, did you get it working?
 Juest, grub?
 Juest, no none - but feel free to ask here
