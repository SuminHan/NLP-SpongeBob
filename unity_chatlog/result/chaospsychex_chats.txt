 The GUI is 'garbled' . i didn't have this problem with 10.10
 Intel Corporation 82865G Integrated Graphics Controller is what i have

 can i 'downgrade' back to 10.10  without having to download 10.10 ?
 iknoia: 11.04 is stable?
 ikonia: can you help me? i am having an issue with my GUI being 'garbled'
 ikonia: wasn't like this in 10.10
 celthunder: Intel Corporation 82865G Integrated Graphics Controller
 celthunder: i guess the installation picked what driver to use? How can I view the installation log?
 celthunder: what does that command do?
 celthunder: so I need to load i915?
 celthunder: ok it's showing up. how do I load it? what's the command to see what driver is currently loaded?
 what's the command to show what video driver is currently loaded?
 ok i915 is loaded for video and I am having issues with the GUI being garbled
 how can I load another intel video driver?
 celthunder: how do i list the available drivers that can be loaded?
 celthunder: gnome, i915 is loaded
 celthunder: it can, didn't have this issue with 10.10
 celthunder: you mean 'safe mode" ?
 celthunder: do i select that from the login screen ?
 celthunder: how?
 i am just going to install 10.10
