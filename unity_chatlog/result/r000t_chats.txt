 Hello. I'm having serious input lag issues after upgrading, but I'm not sure which package is causing the problem, thus making it difficult to report the bug. What should I do now?
 Emasarn, that's because AMD made the x64 standard. It will work fine with Intel chips
 Backspace key especially is laggy, like whole seconds between when I use it and when it decides to work
 I'm having major keyboard lag after upgrading, what do I do?
 aravinda, if you use your keyboard a lot, don't upgrade
 hypetech, major keyboard lag after upgrading
 I have a 5 second lag when I use the backspace key
 ohsix, I don't know what the first two mean, and no, I did not change xorg's priority
 ohsix, http://pastebin.com/dC4B8hpK
 ohsix: http://pastebin.com/MXxmt6h5
 ohsix: exe is probably WINE
 People who initially hated unity but now love it: Please look up the stockholm effect
 ohsix: yes
 Also after using backspace more than once, all keys lag
 Now I have another issue: Chrome is default browser but xchat opens links in Firefox after upgrade
 ohsix: did you ever get those pastes?
