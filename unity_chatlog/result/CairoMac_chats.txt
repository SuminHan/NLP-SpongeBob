 or rather how to fix it
 Gnea: no i was an upgrade
 acicula: any idea on how i would fix that?
 eys
 *yes
 though the upgrades never worked properly for me
 they always killed my computer in some way
 this is the latest

 apt-get purge samba4
 apt-get install samba4
 ?
 ok
 thanks
 acicula: jsut so you know, samba4 has some problem upgrading when i upgraded to 11.04
 that's probably the cause
 acicula: yes
 it it ok if it has lots of "ignored unknown paramater:"?
 oh
 i am
 you can see lots of them in http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/9931/img3504o.jpg
 up the top
 so it might be ok?
 im abiut to rebiit
 and ffind out
 acicula: no, that doesn't fix it
 this is waht i got when i reinstalled samba4
 http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/80/img3506pc.jpg
 acicula: not afaik
 unless they were automatically installed
 acicula: i dont think so
 not unless they were installed automatically
 acicula: i assumed that 11.04 installed that by default...
 if i purge samba4 again and install samba would that wrok?
 acicula: oh
 acicula: ill try that then
 acicula: it gets further now..
 though it throws a failed error
 and it turns out i had samba AND samba4 installed
 jsut amo
