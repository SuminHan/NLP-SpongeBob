 what is the grub2 badram equivalent to grub legacy memmap?  I recently did a clean install of Natty (was Lucid), and it now uses grub2.
 DosAmp, I tried that.  it didn't like "memmap" as a kernel parameter.
 I used "memmap=0x10000$0x13c140000" in the kernel command in grub legacy.  same command in grub2 doesn't work. (for some reason, the ram in that address range--and only that address range--doesn't behave well)
 I noticed /etc/default/grub has a "GRUB_BADRAM" line, but the documentation I found on it wasn't at all clear for me
 does anybody use "memmap" or "badram" in grub2?  I'm trying to understand how these work in grub2, but without much luck
 aha!  the dollar sign in "memmap" command in grub2 needs to be escaped twice in /etc/default/grub, such as GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX='memmap=0x10000\$0x13c140000' or GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="memmap=0x10000\\\$0x13c140000".  Not very clear from the documentation.  I think it's working now, so peace out!
