 easy question: I
 I'm ssh -x ing into my ubuntu box
 but can't open folders that requre root access
 normally i'd be prompted to enter my password
 yes, I know that, but it's in a shell
 i mean
 it's in the gui
 so a better question
 okay, is there a way to enable the gnome session to view the locked drives?
 mount?
 how do you remotely log into your machine so you can view it over VNC?
 it requires me to be logged in
 to enable remote assitance
 assistance
 which i can do via ssh -x
 but then i'm viewing that session
 i believe one is already running
 or at least
 when I sshed in
 i started it through the gnome gui
 okay, so having installed a vnc server, how do I start an x session running
 essentially, how do I log into my machine without connecting a keyboard to it
 so I can use the vnc server
 I have ssh
 i can even ssh -X in
 but I need a full session running
 to do a couple things that a remote X session won't do well
 so, using ssh, how do I tell my computer to "log in"
 locally
 ohsix I'm trying to access some features of gnome that don't work over an ssh -X connection
 so I need my computer to log in locally
 so I can use VNC
 so, using ssh, how do I tell the computer to log in locally so I can use vnc to access the local session
 so, ohsix, any suggestions?
 ohsix, did I miss your answer?
 x11vnc, correct?
 ohsix, so, a simpler question
 I have partitions that I could access just fine if I had mounted them using gnome
 I can't do it using a gnome session (i've tried)
 remotely
 is it a bad, bad idea to try and use my ubuntu box as a DNS server for my home intranet?
 is there an "easy" way to do it
 i can point the router to my home machine
 a second machine to just do dns
 it's probably better to stay away since I don't fully understand it, and doing it improperly could rip a hole in the universe
 well, more like bring down my home network, but close enough
