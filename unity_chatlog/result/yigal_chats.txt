 does anyone use vim and has just installed 11.04?  I don't have syntax highlighting and I was wondering if anyone has/had a similar issue, or or fixed this?
 virgilivs: no that's not what happened
 virgilivs: I still have my vimrc file
 virgilivs: no because even manually :syn on fails
 taglass: I know, but I have both installed
 taglass: there is no vim-full in 11.04 which I find interesting
 virgilivs: I'm just going to build the latest vim from git, why not
 sakuramboo: I like unity quite a lot from the little I've used it
 virgilivs: have you done a fsck.<file-system>? yet?
 virgilivs: what do you get with 'apt-get dist-upgrade'?
 virgilivs: what's in your /var/log/apt/history.log?
 virgilivs: but /var/log/apt/ the folder does exist for you?
 virgilivs: so look at previous logs and find the one that does
 virgilivs: termlog's are right protected so you'll have to use sudo to grep those
 virgilivs: ok, but sometimes it's a good exercise to try and get the machine back up again
 virgilivs: but time doesn't always permit
 virgilivs: you can always reinstall everything using apt
 dpkg --get-selections > MyPackages
 virgilivs: and then use that list to reinstall everything
 yes use aptitude if you're more comfortable with it
 virgilivs: ya I did also :)
 cool
 FHtrain: install full ubuntu and then we'll talk, jk
