 can anyone help me with an apache2 issue?  whenever I go to my site via my dyndns name it changes ht eURL in the browser to my IP address
 rileyp: so just write an entry in /etc/hosts with IP - fqdn?
 rileyp: oh this is external
 port-forwarded out the FW
 go to dyndns entry from the outside and it rewrites the dyndns to my external IP
 rileyp: I'd assume it keeps the dydns name in it the whole time
 np thanks for the help!
 now to run this VM through the 11.04 upgrade
