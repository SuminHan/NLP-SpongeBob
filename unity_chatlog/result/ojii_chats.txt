 happy natty everyone
 i forgot again how I can only download (but not yet install) natty on my 10.10, can anyone help out?
 escott, ah, i thought there's a apt-get command to do it :(
 just upgraded to natty and love it!
 is there a way to move the unity bar from the left to the right?
 jatt, that's pretty bad... I have a 4 screen (two notebooks) setup, and now I have the bar in the middle on the right pair.... and it's hard to activate it since i use synergy and the mouse just moves to the left pair...
 jatt, but other than that I like unity :(
 is there a way to flag folders as 'not-to-be-indexed/searchable' by the unity launcher?
 hi everyone
 for some reason the interface language in my login screen is in japanese, but after I login everything is in English (as it should be), how can I change/fix the language in my login screen?

 how do I move a window to another workspace in unity? In 10.10 I'd just right-click->move to workspace X
 usalabs, right click does nothing there
 usalabs, wow that's *really* intuitive :(
 usalabs, I know how to get out of full screen mode (I prefer double-rightclick), I just find it really odd that I have to do that to move it to another workspace, ideally I'd be able to drag it but maybe that's asking too much
 usalabs, didn't for me :(
 guess I'll just stick to single-workspace mode
 also, is there any hack out yet to move the damn 'unitybar'? I have a 4 screen setup + synergy. now the bar is in the middle of my screens and hard to 'activate'
 ah thanks usalabs, still seems a bit too hard for such a trivial task, but that's nicer
 oh nice
 usalabs, thanks a lot, that's how i want it ;-)

 how do I change the language of my login screen?
 is there a way to change the shortcuts in the launcher? I won't ever need "view photos", so I'd like to replace it with something that is useful to me

 dd214, yes
 dd214, on login you can select whether to boot into unity or plain old gnome
 pauru, I did, but the language i chose there is not the one showing up on login
 pauru, my language after login is English (as it should be), but in login it's Japanese
 dd214, oh, you can change the default in the login screen settings though
 pauru, yep, several times
 pauru, also some shell commands (eg mysql/postgres) show Japanese UI
 pauru, it is, and most of the time I don't mind
 pauru, but when other people try to do shit on my machine they're usually a bit confused
 bazhang, oh, sorry
 pauru, I probably should just look at it as a security "feature" ;-)
 chingwa, what's the problem?

 chingwa, locally? try `sudo apt-get install smplayer`
 chingwa, do no videos work or only some?
 is there a way to replace the 'show photos' shortcut in the launcher with something that is useful for me?
 does anyone here know how to *UN*install amazonmp3? `sudo apt-get remove amazonmp3 --purge` does not work, but /usr/bin/amazonmp3 is still there and the unity launcher finds it :(

 Is there a way to replace the 'view photos' shortcut in the launcher with something else?

 is it normal that banshee doesn't show a notification when the song changes? If not, how do I enable it?
 lukenukem, not an expert, but you could try: ctrl+alt+F2, type  `metacity --replace &`, ctrl+alt+F7
 lukenukem, or try to open a shell using ctrl+alt+t from your current screen (no F2ing)
 lukenukem, that sounds bad and probably someone more experienced than me should try to help you
