 Daekdroom: Already done it on thread
 Daekdroom: Guys whenever I leave my PC idle for 20-30mins the screen turns off and the power light flickers but it doesn't turn on no matter what . I always have to hard restart when that happens . And on restart I see what ever work was left to be done on the desktop like UPDATES or DOWNLOADS had been working well just the display was giving problems .
 Dr_Willis: Is it helpful cause Ubuntu forum never has turned helpful towards my problems the IRC at least has helped me sort out problems
