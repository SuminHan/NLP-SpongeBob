 I slept through most of the downloading.
 three or so hours.
 the installing only took like.. is taking, maybe two hours or so, so ya, about five hours total.
 sometimes 15 with 'powerboost' as they call it, but that doesn't apply to this.
 2 or 3 is my up if I remember right.
 honestly I know one thing that doesn't work too well on 11.04, at least not for me. Alltray.
 I already altered the necessary configuration in unity's desktop setup for everything to be visible in the notification tray that needs be
 luckily for me I still have cairo dock as well.
 how does one go about customizing the menu buttons, the close program, minimize, maximize ones? I don't like em on  the left, or those style buttons.
 most of those ones, I really didn't need.
 I don't know if I missed it but did someone mention how to alter those three buttons in natty, or is there a way?
 sakuramboo: I use cairo dock as a secondary panel setup, lets me do that.
 That was my original 'panel' replacement, in gnome enviroment, and it still works in unity.
 ... that's what cairodock does
 it uses the OLD style menu
 with genre seperation
 I've got .. 133 at least.
 including emulators
 As far as I know, no, but I've not used it as long as others. Just started about 4 or so hours ago, if that.
 I already knew that something like this was coming with unity, so I kept cairo the way I liked and kept the conf files for that and grub.
 Most of the packages that didn't come with the upgrade haven't been an issue with me, yet, sakuramboo
 sakuramboo So far my only major complaint with unity is it's integration with desktop wall on compiz, I prefer desktop cube. Plus some of the upgrading didn't let me install debs from link, aka downloading a deb and having it open in software center. It keeps saying the listed file doesn't exist in repositories.
 Does anyone know how to alter the unity menu to split up the applications more like the old style? Or how to move the buttons for minimize/maximize/close program to the right again?
 sakuramboo: I tried to, but when I did it said unity needed them, you sure you want to do that?
 Does anyone who has more unity experience then sakuramboo and I know for sure if it's safe to switch from desktop wall to desktop cube if unity says it needs it, on compiz?
 it does death..
 deathknight: It's just setup differently then you expect.
 every time I try to install simple-ccsm it says I don't have the necessary dependencies..
 I will admit I know one thing that makes almost no sense to me, on the media player front for Ubuntu. As a music player/movie player, I've yet to see VLC be beat. plus it uses so little of my system the only thing I seen take this little is mpd based, and that cuts out your audio for any other program.
 chadi: I was wondering something along those lines as well. I want to alter where they're located on mine.
 chadi Where is that? I forgot about gconf.
 found it
 chadi: gconf-editor?
 crap..
 chadi: My normal windows are fine, it's the maximized one I want to alter.
 Somehow I hit a command in xchat IRC client which made it go 'fullscreen' where there's no top bar/menu, unless I go to another program. What is the keyboard command for that?
 log out
 badbandit: log out then select ubuntu classic
 I agree freeman, they had their reasons for it.
 on multimedia system selector, is it better to autodetect, alsa, or pulseaudio?
 xust: I have the same problem too, different drivers, but they're not in use either.
 xust: gts 250
 freeman yes they have the system tray, it's just limited. you can alter it to work as standard.
 That's what I was asking pythonpup, which one is stable/best quality?
 also have another odd issue with the audio seperate from that..
 well at least I figured out part of the audio issue I'm having.
 it's a USB gaming keyboard with audio input/output jacks on one side, and usb on the other.
 you gotta do _ if you want space
 any idea how to get pulseaudio to recognize pnp aka headphones from a usb keyboard after logging out and logging back in?
 Every time I log out and log back in it causes the autodetect to stop recognizing the headphone jack on my keyboard as able to support audio.
 So whatever the issue with my headphones it's not directly related to my sound layer system.
 Does anyone have experience with headphones not working properly after a log out?
 eiriksvin a lot of us are having that issue too.
 I'm in unity right now, just because I've gotten used to the setup.
 I have a GTS 250 too so it's not a ram issue.
 if you haven't really gotten a chance to look at the unity setup, you may want to before you do.
 ahh, loading the interface no, but moving windows around.. compiz is laggy.
 Well moving my windows around is.
 I don't use wobbly windows.
 it's snapping windows that's lagging it.
 I just disabled snapping and enabled wobbly, it's running a lot smoother.
 awesome..
 it works.
 I'm curious as to unity working with desktop cube.
 I do drAg
 IF you have used unity and desktop cube
 so it's possible to disable desktop wall and still use unity fine?
 What all besides enabling unity after compiz disables it, logging back out and back in do I have to do to get desktop cube working normally drAg
 It won't let me use the controls it used to.
 itsTOREN: you using unity 2d, ubuntu, or ubuntu classic?
 weird.. you should be able to get a 3d effect then. That's using unity
 is the third party driver enabled for your graphics card?
 ..ok really weird.
 I'll just deal with wall..
 When you're available drAg, do you have any experience with g110 usb keyboards and pnp audio using headphones on 11.04? It did it on 10.04 through to this too.
 Have you ever had the sound preferences crash when logging out back in when using headphones on a usb keyboard's headphone jack?
 Every time I log out and log back in for something the pnp audio doesn't work, drAg, sorry to keep pestering.
 what's fluxbox like?
 what did you upgrade from/to the first time?
 you're a masochist.
 I used to.
 hey I use whatever ubuntu has installed.
 kaushal: how so? on login it's either Ubuntu, or Ubuntu classic
 recovery console :P
 drAg stop, you're being a unbelievable dooouuuuu$$^
 has anyone ever had an issue logging out and logging back in with headphones on a usb keyboard not being recognized? I've had that since 10.04, b ut only had this keyboard since 10.04
 god so many choices in shells
 xfce or lxde?
 I'm having odd issues with flash embedded video/audio players, outside of youtube. Though part of those are using html5 so don't know if any of the ones I've watched WERE using flash player.
 On sites like beemp3 and crooksandliars, when using their players I have the player's components disappear and all I see is the player background, as well as some of the video if I open up any controls over it. Sometimes that happens on videos directly, spots that are blocky showing the background, instead of a low quality pixel o the image.
 Found out the issue I was having is a firefox problem, not sure if it is flash itself, or simply certain sites since the 11.04 upgrade.
 ok that was annoying..
