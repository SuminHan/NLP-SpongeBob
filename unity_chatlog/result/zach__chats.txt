 Hi i hav a problem with making a usb startup disk with 11.04
 for some reason the live usb installation disk i made can't boot
 it doesnt even get to booting
 i've done it before on the same computer and it worked
 with a different distro
 no it was lubuntu
 no both computers used intel graphics
 Dr_Willis, do think they .iso image i downloaded might be corrupt?
 Dr_Willis, the download isn't corrupt
