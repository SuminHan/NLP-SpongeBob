 mathews: the files are still there

 mathews: Save inside live CD?
 freeman: iphone or ipad?
 yeah
 How about I create a partion on my HDD and transfer the documents into the new partition and do the upgrade
 but my files are 10GB plus
 the only way to make a new partition and move my home folder there
 Will it work?
 The idea of Distribution Upgrade in Ubuntu is probably the stupidest idea ever..................................................................
 Especially online upgrade
 It better to burn an iso and upgrade it
 Very little risk involved
 Anything can go wrong with the distribution upgrade
 The online one
 Stpid upgrade
 next time when new version release, ask everyone to burn it an iso and install it
 kevinamadeus: Yes
 UBUNTU ONLINE DISTRIBUTION UPGRADE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!
 always fail
 ever since 4.04
 red2kic: you must be joking
 uabn93> If you wanna upgrade download the iso
 and istall it
 Online upgrade is very unstable
 anything can happen
 kz3: sudo apt-get install metasploit
 Im angry why nothing has been done to fix that
 kz3: go syamtic package manager
 freeman: Virtual machines
 freeman: VMware or Virtualbox
 Just asking, why ubuntu dumped gnome andd use unity instead?
 freeman_: and its not working, instead it backfires
 10.10 is probably the best
