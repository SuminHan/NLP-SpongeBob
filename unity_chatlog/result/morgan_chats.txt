 Hey. I cant seam to enable my Wireless Device in my system tray. It seams my Broadcom device is not broadcasting. The drives are activated but I can't find it via my system tray icon. http://pastebin.com/PC0gjwAk
 I have just insalled the 11.04 and the wireless is not working.
 usalabs: Well, i have the icon for network in the upper right corner (system tray right?) . I have connected via my cellphone externally to get to Internet. So the ordinary wired network works. I have ticked the 'Networking Enabled' options and in the Ubuntu 10.04 I had before had one for wireless to be ticked too. I don't have it. Can I enable my wireless card in any other way? The drives are installed and the hardware switch is
  set to on.
