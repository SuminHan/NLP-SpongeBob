 hi, i installed gnome 3 (i use nouveau). Everything runs snappy but moving the windows lags a lot. the mouse is much faster than the window moves. Anyone know of this problem?
 (i'm using 11.04)
 heard it might have something to do with nouveau and vsync. maybe anyone know how to disable vsync with nouveau?
 How can i disable vsync with nouveau driver?
 bullethead, i just installed it
 but i have a problem with laggy window moving
 if i move the window it lags way behind the mouse cursor
 ZeXx86, i'm using nouveau
 with gallium
 works pretty snappy but the windows lag bad
 :(
 i had problems with the proprietary nvidia driver, it would slow down to a crawl when there were tray icons (empathy for example)
 wel, actually it does ;)
 seems like my problem is related to vsync being enabled
 but i have no clue how to turn it off in nouveau
