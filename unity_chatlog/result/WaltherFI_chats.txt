 That's something W7 does, recovery partitions etc
 Official release out yet?
 of course it is upgradeable, but i'd still recommend a clean install
 i've been through so much trouble after failed upgrades

 Popopo: go with the manual partitioning, merge some partitions and make space for ubuntu
 DirtyDawg: wubi is not recommended
 Popopo: aircrack-ng is not officially supported
 Popopo: for that, ask some other channel
 DirtyDawg: wubi often breaks after some use, it is not intended for long-term usage
 i totally advice for installing alongside
