 i'm looking for a GUI to start/stop upstart services
 I must be overlooking it
 !repositories
 trailoryo: check out those links for how to mess with your repositories
 anyone heard of a GUI to start/stop services?
 I kinda can't believe there isn't one
 akshatj_: bah, sure, but I still can't believe there isn't an official ubuntu interface for status/start/stop upstart services.
 trailoryo: no problem. try googling first, and see if any results are on the ubuntu wiki, or in a forum post on the ubuntu forums with '[SOLVED]' in the title.
 I've been trying to track down what mirror file ubuntu is talking about when it says 'warning: failed to find mirror file' but all ifind are unrelated issues where that message jsust happens to appear in people's logs. any suggestions?
 Id like to update but I'd really like to do it from anywhere but the default since I'm sure its still overloaded
 Doom_-_: unlock an exe?
 kyubutsu: I'm trying to run do-release-upgrade, not download a cd image. but good on you for suggesting the torrent as opposed to just downloading an iso directly
 Jordan_U: I wasn't running a gui but I can. I'll run that check for the fastest mirror and then try the update. very good suggestion, thanks. 'm still not sure what 'mirror file' its talking about is missing
