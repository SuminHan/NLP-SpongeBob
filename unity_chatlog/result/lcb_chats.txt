 It was a nice ride. Thanks to all at #ubuntu*
 mordof, can you get grub menu? (SHIFT after bios loading and before grub - then recovery)
 mordof, did you try that sequence?
 mordof, probably not. try and say something after that
 mordof, don't do anything you are not sure... just go to the recovery menu and cameback here
 KNUBBIG, it depends on your inter-speed ;)
 KNUBBIG, did you upgrade before the distro upgrade?
 KNUBBIG, so you have loads of things installed :)
 KNUBBIG, not too much .. :0
 KNUBBIG, let it go, don't interrupt or you might get screwed
 bastidrazor, it seems you have a kb problem. just hit ALT+F4
 KNUBBIG, yes. hopefully you don't have any pop-up prompts in meanwhile
 KNUBBIG, just sleep well and don't have bad dreams about the end of the world :p
 mordof, so you do really need the help of a live cd/usb
 mordof, sure because most of the system is now 11.04, isn't?
 mordof, go easy with that. in meanwhile backup your /home /etc and /usr dirs
 mordof, yes, you could burn cd/s with it
 mordof, yes because you are having problems accessing the system. with a live cd you could access the partitions and backup what's necessary.
 KNUBBIG, don't play with grub while upgrading... go to sleep :p
 lol, no
 KNUBBIG, SHIFT before loading ubuntu and just hit 'update grub' on the recovery menu, just in case
 KNUBBIG, but don't worry about that now.
 KNUBBIG, hehehe
 mordof, a hint... the directories i told you, select Compress from nautilus. it would be easier that way to backup.
 mordof, after repairing or anytime?
 mordof, oh, ok then
 conical, and short
 wow... 1800+ happy users in here :o
 a2c4n9e1, ok, sorry, let me take you off the balance :)
 a2c4n9e1, just use classic desktop. you get the same as before
 zvacet, :)
 a2c4n9e1, so....? you need a nife? :) j/k what happened?
 a2c4n9e1, a jackhammer, that's the only thing i use for hard-to-solve issues
 a2c4n9e1, why don't you install 11.04 and do the changes afterwards?
 a2c4n9e1, previous were grub2, too
 a2c4n9e1, yes. the help page for grub2 is pretty good and there are some scenarios, probably what you need too. hold on..
 a2c4n9e1, look at this -> http://goo.gl/0qRRN and this -> http://goo.gl/uMAgK <- better if you do it instead of someone who don't know for real what's going on in there.
 a2c4n9e1, i'm hanging / on
 subcool, what's going on with that ' PRETTY_PLEASE ' package?
 a2c4n9e1, see... am i good at construction work or not? ;)
 a2c4n9e1, yes it can. use unetbootin to "burn" that flash
 a2c4n9e1, stop, look and wait, though...
 a2c4n9e1, update and fix 10.10 as it should be, before. do ' sudo -i ' then ' apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get check && apt-get -f install && apt-get autoremove && apt-get clean '
 a2c4n9e1, then go for it; upgrade
 a2c4n9e1, that's a must!!!!
 a2c4n9e1, for everyone, not only for you. so, don't feel a privileged user
 a2c4n9e1, why?
 a2c4n9e1, you want to remove everything from that disk, is that your idea?
 a2c4n9e1, is that an upgrade or "fresh" install?
 a2c4n9e1, btw, if you are "playing" with the partitions better first backup your /home and probably /etc and /usr
 a2c4n9e1, you might not need /etc and /usr ... it's just in case you have some configs and packages you would like to take a look afterwards
 a2c4n9e1, and in my opinion, before installing whatever, use the  new image or another live linux and go to those dirs and compress , with nautilus, for example
 a2c4n9e1, then copy to another media, of course
 a2c4n9e1, so burn the flash and you both (you+distro)  will be happy ever after
 a2c4n9e1, the change/upgrade?
 a2c4n9e1, of course it is. you get everything up-to-date. if you like a couple of ppl don't like unity use classic desktop option at login
 a2c4n9e1, or use unity + some fancy menu utility, like "avant window navigator "
 a2c4n9e1, or... add to startup applications ' gnome-menu ' and you'll have the bottom gnome panel.
 a2c4n9e1, sorry, ' gnome-panel '
 a2c4n9e1, you have the answer on those tutos i gave you
 a2c4n9e1, pretty explanatory
 Oday, i think it depends your usage of it. on "software center " type cvs
 Oday, :)
 Oday, no, but you have packages in there for almost everything. try it and the ones you don't like it remove it. don't forget ubuntu is not like windoe$, so no garbages afters
 Oday, well, not so much as on the other one. you are right though. check their pages for features then
 TheBuntu, just upgrade normally
 ny51bern, check the scenarios there, you might get the one you need
 ny51bern, btw, a2c4n9e1 receives a commission on every user i try to help, that's why
 ny51bern, check the commands for grub :P that's how i learn
 ny51bern, on those pages there is one with the list of commands
 FunnyLookinHat, i like your hat. reminds me one i saw today on the wedding in london
 ny51bern, look, handling grub is not difficult. difficult and very risky is trying to help someone remotely, because you can easily screw everything. go slowly and with patience and you'll get it.
 ny51bern, unless someone else want to give a try, with this "confusion" in the #chan
 ticks? my cat
 Oday, :)
 Oday, that's a good one
 Oday, the package
 engammalsko, don't yell.. there is ppl sleeping here
 trae, don't worry. in time the transit police would be here
 maxflax, i took a quick look. do sudo apt-get check && sudo apt-get -f install
 maxflax, you didn't upgrade your system before 11.04 :(
 a2c4n9e1, :)
 kycka, from zero
 maxflax, did you?
 maxflax, also type sudo dpkg -a
 maxflax, before upgrading to 11.04 we need to update/grade our previous installation
 maxflax, upgrading not meaning dist-upgrade
 maxflax, it works, try to reboot
 maxflax, wait...
 maxflax, when the system is booting press SHIFT after the bios messages. you'll get the choice of kernels. select recovery. then you'll get a menu. select first CLEAN, then DPKG, then GRUB lastly failsafeX
 maxflax, no precipitations, do it calmly
 Ubuntu, disable it and use generic while there is no update on those
 raylee_, is it raylee_ , i mean, really is
 ubottu, because the system didn't recognize 3d
 Ubuntu, after removing the proprietary driver on "Additional Drivers" do failsafeX and reconfigure graphics
 Ubuntu, i know but there are some issues, among xorg not working with some graphics
 curiousx, i'm one among more curiousx on what to help
 ny51bern, yes, sure
 Ubuntu, hopefully yes, because i'm a junk computer colector
 ny51bern, yes, update
 ny51bern, backup your /home dir to play on the safe side
 maxflax, sorry, i have visitors here. try going to recovery again (SHIFT | - select the 2nd kernel  option from the top = recovery mode | go to the end of the new menu and select "root prompt" and type ' sudo dpkg --configure -a ' see if that helps.
 btw, what i wrote before goes for every unfinished upgrades. hopefully it works
 Soothsayer, boot from live cd or usb and check the file-system
 Soothsayer, why ext3?
 Soothsayer, oh... weird
 Soothsayer, what utility are you using to format?
 Soothsayer, delete and then format ext4?!... (try setting the bios to defaults and also detecting properly the disks
 superlinux, we saw that already, thanks
 ph88, http://goo.gl/X1dxK
 ph88, that's a pretty explanatory tuto
 info connect-proxy  | ph88
 !info connect-proxy  | ph88
 eltigre, sudo dpkg-reconfigure empathy
 emj, my 2 tokens; TeamViewer (graphical) or putty + ssh (CLI)
 Rockj, yeap, with the advantage of being used from everywhere
 Rockj, :)
 compdoc, nice move
 compdoc, it depends the servers you install. you might need some nail typing...
 pbandcheezwhiz, there are some known issues with duals. probably better starting with default drivers and then test again with proprietary ones
 htcrwn148, no but backup /home first. then ' sudo -i ' and  ' apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get -f install && apt-get check && apt-get autoremove && reboot
 htcrwn148, remove those ' sudo 's in the middle
 wabznasm, needs to update the system first...
 wabznasm, yes... and fix the system too, just in case
 blit, it upgrades normally, no need of commands or whatever
 blit, no. unless you dad major problems in meanwhile. but the updates are processed normally until you get the full system as 11.04 final
 blit, dad/had
 ibeekman, i don't use it, but gparted doesn't do it?
 bc81, me 2
 bc81, some issues with graphics but in time would be resolved
 quellhorst, SHIFT before grub loads
 blit, yes, that's how i'm running now. dist-upgrade or the commands used before don't work, as you can see. i mean they work but don't produce anything, saying the system is up-to-date
 quellhorst, but you get the screen with kernels or not?
 quellhorst, right after SHIT and when the options are present press one of arrow keys or something
 shit/SHIFT.. oopsy
 quellhorst, select recovery and besides doing the DPKG option do GRUB option too
 quellhorst, on the second choice on top, current kernel
 quellhorst, hopefully  corrects that...
 quellhorst, you might need to reinstall it or.. try the sudo dpkg-reconfigure package
 cebrian, did you let the system upgrade or interrupted at some point?
 cebrian, try 'sudo dpkg --configure -a '
 cebrian, try what i wrote
 cebrian, you should tell us that on first place :p
 cebrian, because ppl assumes everything went well while upgrading.
 cebrian, look at me.... hold on, i need to type a couple things...
 cebrian, press SHIFT after bios messages and before grub loading. Select the second option on the top (recovery), Select DPKG option, then, GRUB option, then failsafeX option. Selet on there to fix X and then default configuration and CANCEL, and restart X.
 cebrian, write that down and try to see if fixes your upgrading
 cebrian, reboot when you get the login screen
 cebrian, do CLEAN too on there. On DPKG check if no errors updating
 cebrian, if so..  try again. means the connection was not established or slow mirrors
 cebrian, if that doesn't fix and since yu broke/stopped the upgrading process i would use a live cd, backup (compress with nautilus option and copy to other media) /home (you might want to backup /etc and /usr too ) and better of fresh install 11.04. NOTICE that is what i would do.
 cebrian, better, really
 cebrian, upgrades must not be interrupted. if so damages the system
 SeanInSeattle, what are you getting now?
 SeanInSeattle, did you finish the upgrade process or you interrupted it? did you update your previous ubuntu?
 SeanInSeattle, then reboot... :o tell us what happens then
 SeanInSeattle, ok, easy... reboot | press SHIFT after bios messages and then select the second option on the top (recovery menu)
 SeanInSeattle, then, select on that recovery menu dpkg | clean | grub | finally failsafeX .. wait...
 SeanInSeattle, select Reconfigure then Use default (generic) then OK then CANCEL, then Restart X. reboot when you get the login
 SeanInSeattle, got everything?
 SeanInSeattle, ok. don't precipitate urself, go easy
 SeanInSeattle, Reconfigure Graphics
 SeanInSeattle, so you didn't see what i wrote... then Use Default (generic) | OK | |CANCEL | Restart X
 SeanInSeattle, it loops??? or you get a new dialog with 3 options?
 SeanInSeattle, ok, no probs. after Reconfigure Graphics select Use Default Config
 SeanInSeattle, the dialogs looks alike, so put attention on the options i write. Use Default Configuration
 SeanInSeattle, no
 SeanInSeattle, did you select to run in low graphic mode?
 SeanInSeattle, Use Default. and you are doing right, don't do anything before coming here
 SeanInSeattle, next should be OK, then Cancel, then Restart X
 SeanInSeattle, just do that. you wont see any changes
 SeanInSeattle, i know that failsafeX is a bit confusing . it's really badly done, yet. look...
 ahh ok SeanInSeattle. tell me where are you now
 SeanInSeattle, great. but you are using generic drivers. now... reboot
 SeanInSeattle, don't worry, i have about 50 yrs ahead. i'll wait
 SeanInSeattle, yes
 SeanInSeattle, keep going
 SeanInSeattle, yes
 SeanInSeattle, now type in terminal ' sudo /usr/bin/jockey-gtk '
 :(
 SeanInSeattle, look...
 SeanInSeattle, you are going to do this in this sequence
 SeanInSeattle, sudo -i  then: apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade && apt-get check && apt-get -f install
 SeanInSeattle, then ' sudo dpkg -a '
 Moa, what display graphics
 Moa,  did you install the proprietary? ( sudo /usr/bin/jockey-gtk )
 Moa, try it
 Moa, then reboot, don't forget
 luigi_panache, check the topic, probably that's not the help chan
 Moa, so your issue is having the display with strange colors?
 Moa, is that a portable computer?
 Solnse, use the Catalystic Control Center to configure it, not the option "Monitors"
 btw, everyone should see if there is the graphics utility installed and so use it, instead of Monitors...
 Solnse, under Applications check Catalystic
 jsebean, Startup Applications
 Solnse, disable the proprietary driver, reboot, enable it again
 Solnse, type in a terminal -> sudo /usr/bin/jockey-gtk and tell me if is anything loaded or disabled
 jsebean, i told you.... Startup Applications, then add the command
 Solnse, and nothing in there to be enabled?
 jsebean, that's not normal. what app is that?
 Solnse, activate it
 guest, no
 Solnse, if not good DO NOT USE "Monitors" but the Catalystic Control Center
 pls... don't private me. my wife takes the keyboard away from me
 she's very jealous
 janisozaur, logout and select ubuntu classic
 janisozaur, looks like isn't

 janisozaur, yea
 SerialMDK, how come?
 SerialMDK, write the nicks of ppl you are talking to so they are highlighted... is that an 11.04 ISO?
 SerialMDK, what happens?
 SerialMDK, besides the monitor being off :)
 SerialMDK, how do you click install?
 SerialMDK, i was kidding, bro
 SerialMDK, how did you load that iso image to the flash?
 SerialMDK, format the flash and load the image with unetbootin. format the drive you are going to install with ext4.
 Susanna, what graphic adapter or driver installed?
 ahhh, Susanna gnome 3 is not supported yet
 SerialMDK, CD or FLASH?
 Susanna, type in terminal ' sudo /usr/bin/jockey-gtk ' and see if any driver is needed
 SerialMDK, always with the same ISO image?
 SerialMDK, if your computer handles booting from flash you don't need to haste CDs
 SerialMDK, that's weird and first time seeing something like that. better trying what i told you. download the ISO from ubuntu official
 Susanna, is that a first run after upgrading?
 Susanna, might need to reboot. sorry one thing.. was that an upgrade or fresh install?
 SerialMDK, try gurning the flash with unetbootin. if so you'll get more options to check if is a monitor or graphics falt
 falt/fault
 Susanna, , please reinstall
 Susanna, j/k :p
 Susanna, did you do the upgrade as it should - updating previous ubuntu, fixing the system and not interrupting the upgrade process?
 Susanna, i was kidding, as i said right after it. don't need to reinstall
 Susanna, do the failsafeX. you now how?
 Susanna, do the default, to start
 Susanna, SHIFT after bios messages and before grub, recovery, failsafeX and blah blah... i think you know
 ayrton, check under Themes & Tweaks
 silentz0r, what do you get when booting?
 silentz0r, and that is happening only after upgrading or did it before?
 silentz0r, press F8 while booting and select the HD, then press SHIFT while booting
 silentz0r, got it??? first we are trying to boot on the correct media; then we are going to the grub menus
 silentz0r, what type of portable is that?
 silentz0r, is F8 the correct key for selecting the media to boot? i guess so...
 silentz0r, do this.... unplug the power cord. remove the battery. press the power button for about 20 seconds. then put everything back on. then boot. press the key to go to bios and select defaults. save and reboot.
 silentz0r, remove CDs, USBs before...
 silentz0r, but in that order i told you, it's important
 !LTS
 silentz0r, remove the battery. and try again with the cord. something's wrong with that computer, not natty
 silentz0r, strange... can you elaborate a bit lol... you remove the battery and the power cord and still boots?
 silentz0r, ok. did you press the key to go to bios setup?
 silentz0r, sorry to ask, are you sure is the correct key? on acer i believe if F2 isn't? or DEL
 silentz0r, DEL, ESC, F8 ... one of those, not sure on that machine
 silentz0r, that's really strange. do you have anything in the CD drive or USB?
 silentz0r, you need to discharge  that computer. remove the battery, the power cord, wait a while then.
 silentz0r, in any case, go to that model's site and see if there is any known issue. i believe it is a coincidence what's going on. not really 11.04 fault
 coz_,  try changing the mouse. that happened w me too and solved
 silentz0r, for now we only really need to have that machine turning on... ubuntu or other distro or OS is irrelevant at this point
 coz_, i was using an asus mouse on a non asus machine. changed it and problem solved
 SerialMDK, i'm really sorry and i understand how you are. from my side i'm out of ideas :(
 IdleOne, could you try silentz0r pls pretty pls
 IdleOne, noooo.. with his issue
 oops, IdleOne sorry, i mean SerialMDK
 IdleOne, i believe is a hardware issue.. but, just in case you have more ideas.. the comp don't even boot
 silentz0r, was my mistake referring to you, sorry
 SerialMDK, just occurs to me. do you have on that laptop a reset "hole"?
 SerialMDK, hmmm so the other option is resetting CMO
 SerialMDK, did you ever do that? is the pc case open?
 SerialMDK, no, that's not that one, in this situation
 SerialMDK, resetting the CMO. you need to find (manual/user guide) a jumper to reset it. also you need to remove the battery from the motherboard.
 SerialMDK, so try it. but look at the manual to see the exact procedure
 SerialMDK, on a last case scenario remove the HD and at least we know if is or not a 11.04 issue. i'm pretty sure isn't
 newbie112, unplug and plug the kb
 newbie112, keyboard
 newbie112, you might need to reconfigure it then.
 newbie112, it worked before???
 newbie112, restart then. did you try it?
 newbie112, yes
 newbie112, the computer
 newbie112, you can log off and on again. if doesn't work restart
 WhitePelican, just an idea. check if any other application using the camera is running, even if you closed; on skype test and configure it.
 WhitePelican, try sudo dpkg-reconfigure skype_or_the_name_of_package
 WhitePelican, see first on System Monitor if chesse or butter or whatever uses cam is working... because if cheese detects skype should
 WhitePelican, ok, but goto system monitor and see... or logout and login
 WhitePelican, read above the suggestions :p
 nawk, or use Classic Desktop
 WhitePelican, did you get skype recognizing the cam?
 WhitePelican, what did you do? restart?
 WhitePelican, ahh ok, great.
 WhitePelican, i just installed and looks ok...
 WhitePelican, from the regular repos. but that version is for maverik, btw
 WhitePelican, when you start doesn't say "another skype instance may exist"? probably your prob w the pass is there...
 WhitePelican, nooo.... is at the top panel, on the right... should be
 WhitePelican, quit all you have there. probably more than 1 instance, even
 WhitePelican, check system monitor, if for any reason you don't have the indicators
 Sicor, basically a computer :p
 Sicor, about the ram.. you could tweak it, kill some processes you don't need. about 11.04 itself, with no unity, doesn't require too much, i mean, much less.
 WhitePelican, write the nick so ppl can see who are you talking to :p that's another matter - the indicator.
 WhitePelican, matter of fact i scrolled back, just in case .. and i saw it. are you on unity or classic desktop?
 WhitePelican, oh... but you know, i'm not running from medibuntu. yours probably is different and, besides having medibuntu repos i don't see skype in synaptic
 WhitePelican, sometimes is better if we stay with normal releases...
 WhitePelican, but i don't mean by this yours could be buggy. it could be also something elese, the issues you are having
 well, time to sleep, bye WhitePelican. good luck with that. nite all

 purvesh, all
 purvesh, you have enough ram and good cpu
 purvesh, what type of machine do you have?
 purvesh, download 11.04 desktop edition
 Pici, thanks, that's why i told to dld desktop...
 purvesh, i don't think so. Besides, I think you don't get the performance benefits of running true 64bit code on the kernel.
 purvesh, you can NOT move 64 to 32 software
 purvesh, you can backup your home dir and restore it. some .configs you might need to adapt to your machine
 pushpop, in other words, only data should be backed up
 "<zepherin> rchavik: My laptop broke because of it. So I have to reinstall" it doesn't mean it will happen to everyone...
 zepherin, how did it brake, anyway?
 zepherin, did you upgrade following instructions? was your system up-to-date and fixed? did you interrupt the upgrade proccess?
 zepherin, rchavik, if upgrade was interrupted: try going to recovery (SHIFT | - select the 2nd kernel  option from the top = recovery mode | go to the end of the new menu and select "root prompt" and type ' sudo dpkg --configure -a ' see if that helps. In any case, do the same but go to the grub menu and run dpkg, grub and failsafeX (choose to use default drivers)
 rchavik, good luck with that.

 bhaduza1, yes, everything. just drag it
 Chipzzz, not really the upgrade but unity.  upgrade should let your system running fine.
 Chipzzz,there are some steps to take tough, like updating what you have first and checking for errors
 cr4x0r, yes, run classic desktop and install Avant Window Navigator. You'll have almost the same or better plus your graphics running fine.
 cr4x0r, try then running the graphics/monitor configuration from your driver utility.
 cr4x0r, to tell you the truth, i don't recommend no one to run unity when problems with graphics and much less with duals or triples whatever number monitors. classic is better.
 cr4x0r, it's the freaking natty + some drivers not updated + xorg stopping supporting some adapters that makes all problems.
 cr4x0r, interestingly, awm (avant window manager) does a better job than unity, plus you do whatever you want with the desktop.
 cr4x0r, it's a must. i stopped *supporting* unity environment. time enough for devs to fix the issues.
 jbwiv_, something else is cooking there. what i have no clue
 jbwiv_, try sudo apt-get check && sudo apt-get -f install
 n-iCe, let it go, probably a mem issue and it might go away in time.
 n-iCe, no other tty?
 n-iCe, command top
 n-iCe, you see if the process is running.
 n-iCe, i don't know if is possible to do that. my suggestion is let the dld go and put the tty on the graphic environment afterwards
 n-iCe, by looking at top
 n-iCe, but you have there much more than saying is running, don't you? you could have the idea by the load if the memory leak or whatever causing that drops down
 kaffe_02, it's heavy :p (on your graphics utility change the monitors) other way i don't believe it's possible
 kaffe_02, running unity or classic?
