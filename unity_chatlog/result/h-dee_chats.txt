 Hi....Simple question. Currently using 10.10, and I'm thinking about switching to 11.04. But, I'm unsure if Unity 3D will work on my Laptop (No external GPU...only Intel's inbuilt card).
 vibhav: just a sec.
 stefg_natty: Backup is always ready. thanx! First things first!
 vibhav: thanx vibhav. Let me check the specs.
 vibhav: Intel's Integrated Graphics Controller GM965/GL960
 vibhav: Sure!
 vibhav: Was that CPU requirements? or G-card?
 vibhav: no external GPU...so don't know abt clock speed..
 vibhav: JFYI...processor 2.0 GHz 64-bit
 vibhav: Thanx vibhav
 vibhav: By the way, if I suppose want to install Gnome 3 instead of Unity?
 atlef: Thanx! atleast it can support. Good for experimental purpose.
 vibhav: Thanx! I'll try that on my VM first then. Thanks for the help. Have a great day.
 usalabs: Thanks for the suggestion usalabs...seems like I'm surely heading for 11.04 :)
