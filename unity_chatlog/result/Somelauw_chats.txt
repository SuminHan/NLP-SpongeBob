 Hi, what is the gnome program called that handles wallpaper by default?
 How do I activate the gnome wallpaper if it shows the default one? What is the command gnome used to set wallpaper?
 Hi, my default wallpaper is shown instead of the one I provided. Is there a way to activate the wallpaper that I provided myself. It should be somewhere in the settings.
 Hi, how do I do: sudo cat 1 > proc/sys/sysrq ?
 Can I do it without su?
 botcity: I am trying to enable sysrq magic. I have trouble with the getting acces part.
 Hi, my computer just crashed.
 I was asking how to enable reisub? In ubuntu. I tried echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq.
 But it didn't work.
 Ljl, it isn't here. Using ubuntu 10.10.
 LjL: $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
 0
 Ironically, my laptop just crashed.
 And I couldn't use it.
 But this laptop + ubuntu never has been very stable.
 But anyway, I tried to enable it using sudo echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq, but it says I don't have permission. I think that it is because of the ">" inside the command.
 Is there any reason sysrq magic is disabled by default by the way? Since why would you disable such a useful feature
 thanks trismn. I think it worked. If it didn't work. I will probably notice when I reboot.
 iceroot: Here it was disabled. Also I updated from 10.4 to 10.10.
 But really, it was disabled hre by default.
 iceroot: what is the memory dump. Does it work in gnome-terminal?
 It says loglevel set to 0???
 iceroot: It says loglevel set to 0?
 iceroot: tty said that. I did alt + fn + prtscr + m.
 Changing loglevel. Log level changed to 0.
 iceroot: But why do I need to check memdump anyway?
 iceroot: but is uses printscreen instead of sysrq.
 ?
