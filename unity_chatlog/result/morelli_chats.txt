 botcity: i hard restarted it onece and it showed me this static, hard reset again, only first screen showed, so tty1 remove unity, restart ubuntu told me that my hardware can't  use unity(douh unity was gone by that time), another hold, restart gdm
 botcity: and now i'm using classic
 botcity: any idea why i had this tv-like static?
 botcity: what do you mean 'correctly' it works now and worked before unity
 botcity: i got simmilar tv-like static only on boot screan never when the desktop loaded fully
 botcity: yes, but why? you know i wanted to try this 'unity' and stuff
 botcity: but it does not work for me, and i don't know why
 botcity: thanks for help :)
