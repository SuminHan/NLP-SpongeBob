 hello I just installed 11.04 but my nvidia drivers is "currently not in used". I did reboot in a recovery console, purge nvidia-common and reinstall it but it still doesn't work. Any idea ?
 sebsebseb  not for the moment, but the fan is running at top speed all the time
 sebsebseb I think because the lack of the driver the cpu is more used, so the fan speeds up
 sebsebseb nvidia 8600 gts
 sebsebseb installed but not activated
 sebsebseb  how can I install it (I'm a noob sorry)
 sebsebseb where can I get the experimental driver and how to install it ?
 sebsebseb thanks a lot for your help, will try that
 sebsebseb ok will do that. Last question : I have 2 Nvidia drivers (173 & current) Should I uninstall both ?
