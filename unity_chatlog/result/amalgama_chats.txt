 !upgrade
 a question : "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" doesnt work anymore???
 hmmm... i was using dist-upgrade in order to go from one version to another
 !upgrade
 hello... i want to download a program, they give a ppa, which i add, but it says that it cant find a package with that name (after an update of course)... any ideas of what i might be doing wrong?
 i want  to download a music player called foobnix. I add the ppa they give (add-apt-repository ppa...etc), i run an update, but afterwards i cannot find the program in order to install it.. After adding the ppa, it returns :
 Executing: gpg --ignore-time-conflict --no-options --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring /etc/apt/secring.gpg --trustdb-name /etc/apt/trustdb.gpg --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --primary-keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80/ --recv 1B9943C993BD8BC4DDC71C05EE7C02C4940617CB
