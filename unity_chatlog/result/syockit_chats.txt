 Yay, I got back to Ubuntu after long years. Quick question: any changes to Xorg regarding how it reads Xft settings? I still can't set DPI to what I want even though I already have the Xft.dpi entry in ~/.Xresources
 Err I mean fontconfig
 a gde russkii kanal est ubunt?
 poshaluista posetitye #ubuntu-ru dlya polutseniya argh I give up reading that
 Me wants to know how to properly set firefox's dpi settings
 bison, usually root is disabled. Did you setup root by yourself?
 karthick87: are you using Windows Starter?
 karthick87, ok sorry that was a joke. What is the Desktop Manager you are using? Gnome/KDE/else?
 karthick87, usually it is configurable under Appearance.
 karthick87, and if you are using the old Gnome (not Unity), I think it's somewhere under Preferences, but I can't recall
 karthick87, ah, I suppose you've selected one, but then the change does not apply, right?
 karthick87, is there any background currently? or the default? or just black?
 pranav, if on LTS, probably you don't have to worry. Unity is the new interface for newer release
 pranav, on LTS, since many packages still depend on gtk2/gnome2, it's probably difficult to setup gnome3
 karthick87, have you tried what shcherbak suggested? using gconf-editor?
 karthick87, just as I thought, somehow your gconf is probably not yours
 karthick87, if you do 'ls -l .gconf' from your home folder in your terminal,what do you get
 karthick87, sorry for not telling you about pastebin
 karthick87, okay, it does belong to you
 minimal, that's a nice way of pinging ubottu
 trap22, if you're lucky, you can find one in PPA. rhythmbox has lots of gnome dependencies if I'm not mistaken
 karthick87, can you remove ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/background? do 'rm -r .gconf/desktop/gnome/background' from your home folder in terminal
 karthick87, oh, you don't have to paste the result
 trap22, i'm not the music-listener type, but right now I have rhythmbox installed with my Unity-based 11.04
 trap22, I remember using Audacious when I was in Jackalope
 karthick87, and then try to set background again in Appearance
 karthick87, this time, in gconf-editor, does /desktop/gnome/background point to anything?
 karthick87, now that would be strange
 trap22, not a directory?
 trap22, what does it output in terminal? maybe it segfaulted
 trap22, yay it happily runs on my 32-bit! Yeehaw!
 trap22, might be corrupted download. redownload, it's small, worth the try
 karthick87, can you 'gedit ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/background/%gconf.xml' and see if you can save the file?
 trap22, XMMS2 is actually a player daemon/server, which needs a client to interface with, and has loads of installable plugins for you to play with, for the best hellish customization
 trap22, if you're lucky, you might get the plugins you want for audacious. I don't know just what "audacious-plugins" package provides. It lists many audio output, and at the end has this "And many more!" line that makes me wonder. It may or may not contain the "31-band EQ"
 by the way trap22, does that rhythmbox volume slider bug have a bug page in launchpad? Is it fixed? If so, maybe someone could put a backport patch
 trap22, it seems that upstream has it fixed. The patch is somewhere in https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166020 . You may request someone with technical debian knowledge to try apply patch to glib package
 trap22, yup, that difficult to get things fixed. maybe I can try, I need to set up my build service first. It's been a long time since fixing debian packages
 trap22, btw by tracing the bug reports, the problem seems to reside in glib
 trap22, have you enabled the backports repo?
 try enable it a bit, update repo once, and see if libglib2 or rhythmbox is upgradable
 bazhang, is backports safe to enable in LTS?
 elb0w, oh poor dear, what's wrong? Why don't you try unity-2d instead?
 elb0w, ah I see so it doesn't play nice with multi-heads?
 no lsb modules available! wait what? how did I get my distro name again? wasn't it lsb_release?
 wirabumi, selamat pagi!
 coz_, thanks. Oh, it doesn't display the codename
 ubuntu_, alt-F1 to alt-F6
 ubuntu_, wait maybe it was ctrl-alt
 ubuntu_, from X, ctrl-alt. from tty, just alt
 newubuntu, don't prefix ! when mentioning nickname
 Did someone mention witch? Witches shall be lynched
 ubuntu_ no login at all? just blank? but you have X (GNOME/KDE/etc)?
 ubuntu_ tty should've been installed by default
 ubuntu_ see if you have tty1.conf in /etc/init/
 ubuntu_ the conf file is installed by upstart (I found out by doing 'dpkg -S /etc/init/tty1.conf'), and I think it is also installed in your distro
 ubuntu_ the command 'ps' will list running processes. If you do 'ps -a | grep getty', do you get a list, or nothing?
 Sidewinder1, and 11.04 uses it partly
 fredrik__ it's probably a .desktop entry
 fredrik__ maybe quite tricky to find tutorial for that one, seeing google doesn't recognize the .
 fredrik__ if you "ls /usr/share/applications" you get a list of system-installed .desktop files
 fredrik__ if you want to make your own, put it in "~/.local/share/applications"
 Sidewinder1, should be. If I'm not mistaken, they included the fallback in case Unity doesn't work. But I haven't tried
 fredrik__ hence the .desktop file
 fredrik__ I'm pretty sure Unity also searches it
 fredrik__ first let's confirm whether it finds the .desktop entry or not. gedit that wine-extension-gif.desktop and check its name. Then use unity's finder to find it. Is it able to find?
 fredrik__ I just restarted my unity-applications-daemon and it manages to find my custom .desktop. So I suppose it works. After making one .desktop file, you may have to relogin
 fredrik__ do you already have the .desktop entry?
 fredrik__ okay go on and relogin, then try to find that file
 ubuntu_, sorry I'm not sure what's wrong there. so you ctrl-alt-f1 and nothing comes out? Does it stay in GNOME/KDE/XFCE/Unity/whatever  or does it become black screen?
 nerdshell, come to #ubuntu-offtopic. closely related to ubuntu, but not #ubuntu enough
 Dink, you may have to download the flavorless unpatched version of the other to avoid dependency conflict. For example, download firefox 3.6 binaries and install to your home or /opt folder. And also make sure to make new profile
 Dink, yup. I don't know of a deb package that will not conflict
 ubuntu_, wow I haven't seen one that use f1 for X before. Wait, what about arch... err anyways so how about f2 and f3 or others? btw just for the record my X is on 8, and upstart output on 7
 ubuntu_ try "getty 8 38400 tty2"?
 iggyology, or adobe flash?
