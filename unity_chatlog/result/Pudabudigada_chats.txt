 Hello, I just upgraded to 11.04, and now I can't play music.
 It is extremely juddery.
 Other sound, like youtube, works fine though.
 deadpulse, Youtube works.
 I've tried VLC and Mplayer
 It worked flawlessly in 10.10
 deadpulse, No.
 deadpulse, 'file' being the path to an actual mp3 file?
 Can anyone else help me with my sound problem, it won't play smoothly, seemingly in anything.

 Hi, I've upgraded to 11.04, and several things have broken. Most importantly, sound, it is incredibally choppy.

 KM0201, Parole isn't working at all.
 It's not even starting to play.
 KM0201,  Ahh, it works now! Thanks!
 KM0201,  I can play music
 KM0201,  The odd skip, but it's much better.
 Ok, audio seems to work as long as I don't touch the pc while it's playing.
 Is there a way to roll back to 10.10?
 Or are 11.04's issues likely to be fixed soon?
 Halzen, Thanks.
 I want to try reinstalling ALSA, Pulse etc, but my synaptic doesn't work, any clues?

 After the generously-named 'upgrade', my synaptic isn't working, which I want to use to try to fix my sound, any help?
 Halzen, Yes.
 Wonderful...
 Thanks.
 Halzen, Will I keep installed applications that way?
 Ah, okay, how would I do that, Halzen?
 Halzen,  Thanks. This'll be fun...
