 Dr_Willis: yes

 Dr_Willis: yes, from both synaptic and command line
 Dr_Willis: I am wondering the same, generating a defaults one at the moment
 Dr_Willis: KDE now installing.  Not really sure what was wrong with my repository list, but a reset to the defauls has resolved the issue.  Strange as it was just the one left by the install anyway
