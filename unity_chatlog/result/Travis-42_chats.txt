 is there any way to see all of the changes I have made to /etc files?
 is there any way to get Empathy to pop up chat windows when someone messages me? I never notice the small flashing icon on monitor 1 of 3...
 I want to do a "fresh" install of Ubuntu, but then install the same packages (and remove the same packages) -- is there a good way to do this?
