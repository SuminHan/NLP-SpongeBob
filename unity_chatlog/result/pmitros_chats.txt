 I just installed Ubuntu 11.04. Virtually everything broke. Wireless network no longer works. Wired network no longer works. Windows randomly turn white. Visual effects take forever. I've been running Debian+Ubuntu for close to 15 years now, and have never run into a release this buggy. Do any of you know if there are good documents anywhere on everything broken in 11.04, and how to fix it?
 mman: I made the same mistake. Broadcom drivers, in my case, broke. Complex instructions on the interwebs for fixing it. From what I hear, lots of other drivers broke too
 mman: That only works if you have wired. In my case, both wireless and wired broke. I have to follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx to get the wireless back up, which seems like a ton of work
 mman: The package does not include the firmware. The package downloads the firmware during the install. You have to download both the package and the firmware on another computer, and do tricks to make them work together.
 mman: Again, possible, but beyond my threshold of laziness. 11.04 appears to be, rather sadly, the most broken OS I've used in over a decade.
 mman: Yeah. The new interface feels like some undergrad decided to clone the Mac UI as a class project.
 mman: It's about 98% short of being a mature, release-ready project. It doesn't work well with modalless applications, which is most of Unix apps. It doesn't work well with many graphics card drivers. It can't open two terminals from the launcher. It doesn't work right with focus-follow-the-mouse. It's just nowhere near finished
