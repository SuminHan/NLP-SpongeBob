 I'm having a problem with firefox, can anyone help me?
 scrolling is painfully slow on some pages
 remoteCTRL1 AFAIK you can run ubuntu-bug from the installer
 unless you cannot boot of course
 remoteCTRL1, which installer are you using? alternate cd or live?
 remoteCTRL1, boot the live cd and open a terminal
 remoteCTRL1, that's the point of it
 remoteCTRL1, there is a way to report a bug without ubuntu-bug
 remoteCTRL1, but i can't remember which...gimme some time ;)
 remoteCTRL1, here you go
 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+filebug?no-redirect
 remoteCTRL1, it was in the middle of the wiki page
 remoteCTRL1, it was in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs
 remoteCTRL1, middl of the page
 remoteCTRL1, section Filing bugs at Launchpad.net
 remoteCTRL1, but you SHOULD use ubuntu-bug, really...it gives much more "debug" information
 zappus, well...was the partition defragmented?
 ok
 no one hre using firefox and experiencing 100% cpu usage while scrolling? It's driving me crazy :/
 remoteCTRL1, you're welcome!
 zappus, bad things IF it is resizing the partition
 CoachJ, why it shouldn't?
 arsenall_, use the installer as it is
 vatzec, what's the output of ls -la /usr/bin/www-browser
 in gdm there's a menu on the bottom it says Ubuntu classic, change it
 Technium, there is a button to enable it?
 pranav, do you have a ascreenshot?
 Technium, did you reboot?
 Technium, can you provide the output of lsmod | grep nv
 Technium, run in a terminal sudo nvidia-xconfig
 Technium, sudo mv sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 Technium, forget that last line
 Technium, sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.back
 Technium, sudo nvidia-xconfig
 Technium, if anything goes wrong just run
 Technium, sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.back /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 Technium, and yes..reboot
 thegoodcushion, free -m
 thegoodcushion, 32bit os?
 thegoodcushion, videocard?
 thegoodcushion, on 32bit OS part of the address space is used to address devices such as the GPU
 thegoodcushion, so 3.5 gigs is normal
 thegoodcushion, you should use a 64bit OS if you need the extra 500Mb
 nishttal, please don't try gnome3 on 11.04. It will break most of the things horribly
 nishttal, erroro?
 Technium, uh-oh
 Technium, do you have a laptop?
 fachher, shoot!
 Technium, let me guess nvidia+intel with hot switching
 Technium, with unity?
 Technium, would you mind running the live cd again and posting some debug info from it (like video driver, modules)?
 Technium, just install xchat in the live cd and join back #ubunut
 thegoodcushion, not everyone wants PAE
 thegoodcushion, of course
 thegoodcushion, you could have built the driver manually using dkms ;)
 Technium, good
 Technium, post xdriinfo somewhere
 !paste > Technium
 thegoodcushion, what's the error?
 nishttal, thegoodcushion: PAE+closed source -> bad thing
 Technium, that's how i thought
 Technium, you cannot use the nvidia card on linux
 Technium, unless you play with vga_switcheroo
 nishttal, back you should go
 nishttal, between us....unity is crap
 nishttal, uh-oh then I must have mixed the answers...forget mine
 Technium, you cannot use nvidia on linux
 Technium, with the intel card
 thegoodcushion, nvidia+intel+how switching = nvidia driver not working
 Technium, maybe xorg is freaking out because he sees two cards
 Technium, u should try this: Technium, if you are
 Technium, this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics
 Technium, which model do you have exactly of laptop?
 perlsyntax, lspci from terminal
 perlsyntax, output?
 perlsyntax, what's the problem? no drivers installed?
