 :)
 ActionParsnip, I did that before, now again?! I even did a bugfix about it...
 ActionParsnip, It already is options snd-hda-intel model=auto
 ActionParsnip, that was the fix for a MSI AE2020, I put a bugfix about it...
 It fixed my Speakers when I was originally on 10.10
 my Mic already worked...
 ActionParsnip, Can I ask you something first?! Isnt hda for your soundcard?
 My soundcard works fine...
 ActionParsnip, its not part of the soundcard...
 ActionParsnip, I got the webcam and the mic next to it, built in to the PC...
 ActionParsnip, I dont have the option any more...
 ActionParsnip, when I entered lsub in to terminal, it just froze
 *lsusb
 ActionParsnip, do you think teamviewer might help you solve this problem faster? I do have the option of doing it if you want, :)
 ActionParsnip, I need this solved within two hours, *sad face*

 ActionParsnip, Just ran Cheese, Webcam works fine... Should I run Device Manager?!
 ActionParsnip, above mic it has MM
 ActionParsnip, whats the button to Unmute, I remember there being a button...
 ActionParsnip, I only hear a hissing static noise when I do...
 ActionParsnip, Can I give my own opinion?
 ActionParsnip: I think that it is not aslamixer that is the problem, I think the mic needs to be fixed or "found"
 ActionParsnip, you might be right about it being part of the soundcard, but how did I work before?!
 in device manager, under HDA NVidia Sound Card, there is... two things labled "ASLA Capture", In the info about them, one is: /dev/snd/pcmC0D0c and the other is: /dev/snd/pcmC0D2c and they are both: ALC888 Analog

 ActionParsnip, do you know how I know that the mic is not built in to the Speakers/Soundcard?
 ActionParsnip: The Specifications for the computer say "Webcam - 1 x 1.3MP webcam with microphone"
 ActionParsnip: Yes... look at: http://www.avadirect.com/product_print.asp?info=1&PRID=14843 [Top Picture, Tag 4 & 5...
 ActionParsnip: but when it says "Webcam with Microphone" doesnt that mean they are together? They are centimeters apart...
 *Imply
 not mean xD
 ActionParsnip, there is a mic port at the back, for cabled mics and a pic with the webcam...
 *mic
 ActionParsnip, It wont let me select any options on Input on the sound thing, so no, ;'(
 ActionParsnip, I shopped the best I could, I needed  a PC that had stereo mix so I could record PC sound as well... But thanks for your help...
 could anyone else try and help me with this mic problem?
 ActionParsnip, your on... I have a weird idea...
 ActionParsnip, I have an idea...
 ActionParsnip, could my mic be blacklisted? and... not loaded?
 ActionParsnip, I tried a wired mic and it didn't work...
 ActionParsnip, do you know anyone who might be able to help me more?!
