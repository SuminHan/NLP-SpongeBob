 good day. im on a LIVE CD right now, but i have no settings for compiz or any graphic effecs. no unity either. what can i do?
 HF_acid, you mean after you installed the ubuntu on harddrive, or do you have to install unity manually? i thought its on the ISO already.
 Soothsayer, i think its always a good idea to have th operating system and data on different partitions/harddrives, reguardless of dual boot
 hmm, does anyone know if theres a way to force effects and unity on LIVE run? i would like to try out before installing.
 ActionParsnip, i git a GTX460
 hmm i thought you can run unity without drivers. i mean i cant even run compiz. i was able to do so on my old system on older builds without drivers
 ok installing nvidia drivers right now
 reboot the system? on a LIVE system?
 yes, since i want to tryout ubunto, not install it on HDD
 ubuntu*
 ok, whats the command to restart x server?
 why does everything need to be so cryptic in the linux world :/
