 sim-value, unity-2d is the package you'd want for that
 sim-value, if you dont have the card gnome classic should be default, if you want the unity look without 3d accell then install the unity-2d package
 Technium, for an nvidia card?
 Technium, whats the card
 Technium, lspci to paste.ubuntu.com (from the terminal)
 http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1726575 Technium there's a PPA for that, also see if you can disable Optimus in the bios
 http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppa/ubuntu-x-swat?dist=natty  Technium this is the PPA
 Technium, well if you want gnome-classic choose that from the login window, if you want non3d unity install the unity-2d package and select that at login window

 red2kic, ?
 jiltdil, yes its graphical for ufw
 ner0x, like gnucash ? along those lines?
  /msg ubottu please
 ner0x, should be a list in the package manager, or apt-cache search related-term will turn up some
 jiltdil, what about from the command line? sudo apt-get remove packagename
 study, to do what, clarify
 IdleOne, good point
 study, instead of asking a generic question, ask what you really want
 jiltdil, be sure to close software center before you try that command
 study, this is not the channel for that
 study, Ubuntu support
 !alis | study
 jiltdil, close them all and try the command from the terminal
 study, got an ubuntu support issue?
 jiltdil, perhaps a bug? try from terminal to verify its not something else
 autoconf is hardly an ubuntu issue study

 jguzikowski, both work, I have done both without issue; back up as always, and having a separate home is always a good idea
 jakegub, can you disable optimus in the bios?
 jakegub, there's a thread about that on ubuntuforums with a link to a PPA is that the nvidia 420 (cannot remember the exact chipset name)
 MethedMan, ask in #ubuntu-bots dont poll here please
 jakegub, ok. well not sure if the PPA works for that, there is also unity-2d package for non 3d accellerated
 MethedMan, that was a poll question please dont here
 MethedMan, check the package manager
 jakegub, you can enable them via additional drivers and then reboot
 jakegub, then a reboot, and if it says must start in low res mode, go back and try to enable again

 GarryFre, or try the ubuntuforums conky guide

 magusOTB, then your choice really, a small amount is what I'd do, but that's up to you
 MethedMan, by system tray you mean the top panel?
 MethedMan, right click add to panel

 trap22, the latest one out?
