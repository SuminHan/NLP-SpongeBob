 Is there a way to remove memtest and the recovery kernel from the boot menu?
 Let's not start an editor war...
 cheapie: yeah, especially since nano actually has syntax hilighting
 cheapie: personally I like vim. It's amazing, but the learning curve sucks.

 Ah, ok
 Thanks!
 I see disable_recovery bit I don't see anything for memtest
 Ok, thanks
 Ah, I just set 20_memtest -x
 ZykoticK9: nice timing. :P
 There's an abi change with nouveau... and there's a different package that I think needs to be installed?
