 maco: yeah right
 maco: you read this in a book or just make it up as you go along?
 aroman: set keyboard shortcut preferences to what ever you want.
 maco: they dont' fly to london for a release just fyi
 aroman: then not quite sure what you are trying to do?
 aroman: you can't have one key have two functions. You have to use a modifier like the Fn key
 There haven't been updates for a couple of days now 11.04 has been done.
 Just download the daily iso if you people want it so bad
 tanath: devs
 aroman: then change your keyboard shortcut preferences
 aroman: no you can assign that a different hotkey
 aroman: but do what you want.
 tanath: well they aren't going to completely change the interface because you don't like it
 tanath: just don't drag windows past the panel and they won't maximize
 aroman: please stop
 tanath: I don't have those issues
 tanath: if you don't drag it past the top panel it won't maximize
 tanath: further you drag the bigger it gets
 tanath: you hvae to go passed it as i've stated but you'll see for yourself
 #ubuntu-release-party would be more appropriate rather than here
 !ot | Spaz_Dynamic ouyes
 !ot > AustinWolfclaw
 kaatta: you could try using a different gui. Something like xfce or xubuntu etc...
 kaatta: there is help.ubuntu.com has low memory systems options
 Roasted: they are out
 ^Phantom^: what are you trying to do exactly?
 ^Phantom^: well you can lsmod | grep snd-pcm  to see if it's running. If not try locate snd-pcm-oss
 ^Phantom^: and I believe it's snd_pcm_oss
 kaatta: cairo compmgr is a good one that will work well
 kaatta: if you don't want to run compiz
 kaatta: Or you can try mudder I believe gnome3 is using that.

 Spaz_Dynamic: well then stop being offtopic
 x3464: it looks like they need a package for natty but they probably missed that deadline as well.
 x3464: they need to release a package for the development version.
 x3464: so it can be tested etc.. and made sure that it doesn't break anything etc...
 x3464: otherwise it will be in ppa. Or you can build from source.
 KatronixSerf: /j #ubuntu+1
 x3464: it would if someone would submit a deb to teh development version
 econnell: it's not that hard of a process to understand and there are reasons for it.
 asee: can you describe not working
 !party > forces
 econnell: it's not my policy. it's pretty much every distros
 !volunteer | econnell
 econnell: if a user of a distro wants a package. They will submit a deb/rpm/whatever distro plox to a development version so it can be added to official repositories
 econnell: arch/gentoo development is faster because they are rolling releases
 econnell: i bet it was in aur in arch not official repos first
 econnell: or testing
 econnell: I don't know what you want. Distros that just accept any code without it being vetted or requested that would work out well.
 econnell: aur is a user repo like ppa's
 econnell: your app is in ppa so I don't understand the issue
 econnell: I agree with your stance.
 econnell: then maybe nobody wants the app?
 econnell: it's a user based distro
 econnell: community based distro
 econnell: then one of them will make a ppa and produce a deb i'm sure.
 econnell: ventrillo client or something right?

 !hi | sobersabre
 econnell: you and every other linux dev
 sobersabre: add a vga mode to
 econnell: then perhaps the project needs to be picked up by someone else. That's how linux works I don't know what you want.
 sobersabre: here let me get you link you need something like vga=771
 econnell: I would put a message on your forums asking for such
 sobersabre: sorry just saw you are using grub2 read post#17 here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8024427
 x3464: there were other words used
 x3464: scrollback
 econnell: nope just don't understand what you want? or what your question is? perhaps there is a miss comunication
 econnell: I'm just trying to help and explain why it is the way it is.
 maco: a ventrillo client. It's a voice chatting app.
 tuckaway: is it just a default install?
 maco: mangler
 tuckaway: secure it from?
 tuckaway: well if you don't enable them then no.
 VlRUS: hit window key and type in appearance
 VlRUS: nvm they got rid of it. You'd have to install compizconfig-settings-manager if you want to add more effects
 avij: any of the mirrors should support rsync
 avij: rsync doesnt care where you are pulling from
 numberto: is it installed?
 numberto: no are you sure gedit is installed
 numberto: huh?
 Trashi1: drag it there
 launch: .10 comes out in october .04 is in april
 jatt: let me check
 jatt: I don't see a way but you can check. If you install compizconfig-settings-manager it will give you all theoptions to configure unity

 stbain1: you need the firmware for that card. In the hardware drivers app
 xsinick: switch to classic console
 jubei: in natty you have to install compizconfig-settings-manager and change settings under that
 xsinick: no it's running unity
 eiriksvin: you can switch to classic mode instead of unity at the login screen. It's a session choice
 zetheroo1: many people may not switch
 zetheroo1: well you don't have to use unity on 11.04 but I still run 10.04 on my servers etc...
 tanath: just because the version number is higher doesn't make it better fyi. 10.04 is LTS. people running servers aren't going to jump to the latest greates bug filled release
 killer_: pidgin I believe if not it's empathy
 blackshirt: apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
