 Hello everyone, I have some questions related to updating from 10.10 to 11.04. Who could help me with that?
 why fresh install?
 DestroiTe: why fresh install?
 My issue is described here https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/155284   Essentially, I cannot even get it to upgrade
 DestroiTe: If I do go for a fresh install, is it possible to transfer all the settings over (quota, user accounts, etc...)?
 deadpulse: sadly I did not create a separate partition for /home directory. Besides home, could any of the configuration files be transfered
 deadpulse: it sound really painful to get everything configured again. I guess I will just stick with 10.10 till 11.10 :)
 I cannot remember all the things, I had grub password, grub boot menu edited, quota was set up to each user
 deadpulse: I cannot remember all the things, I had grub password, grub boot menu edited, quota was set up to each user
 deadpulse: can I copy over /etc/shadow /etc/group ... too?
 deadpulse, so every user will have to set a new password?
 deadpulse: thanks
