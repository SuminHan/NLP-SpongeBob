 kowen, nice :)
 i just booted 11.04 offa usb disk for a test run.  it didn't load the new interface automatically, is this expected?  in otherwords, do i have to install it onto my harddrive to see the new interface. ... or did my computer not work with the new interface and it reverted back to normal gnome?
 i was looking forward to seeing the new interface after the big stink everyone has made about it.
 Cerda, i got nvidia on my lenovo t410
 ah so on the outs with nvidia then?  i made a poor decision?
 tensorpudding, it's a pretty modern computer. we bought it last year, lenovo t410
 Cerda, aah okay the live system
 thanks for helping me clear that up
 tepster, okay cool.. i am sad i didn't get to see it! :(
 tepster, how new is your machine??
 tepster, yea, mines like a year old..... awww shucks
 brand new from lenovo.. not refurb or anything
 Cerda, awesome then.. i want to try it!  thank you for the advice.  tepster ... lemme bring up my nvidia softwaqre
 tepster, NVS 3100M, 16 CUDA cores, 256MB of RAM, 64bit memory interface
 yay, i have unity :)
 just needed to isntall proprietary nvidia drivers and it works!
 :)  i wasn't sure it was gonna work!  but it does!  i am happy.
 tepster, yes that is correct.  i wonder if the same would have happened if i installed the opensource nvidia drivers.. maybe i'll find out in the future, but for now i'm set!!
 i don't know what the big deal was on the ubuntu list.. this isn't much different than it was before!  i thought it'd be totally different from the whining on the list!
