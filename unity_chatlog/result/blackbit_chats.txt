 HyperShock, try http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/things-to-tweak-fix-after-installing.html
 malik: i tried that and and worked
 I tried "top &". It went background
 lykkefeen, this is a good question
 lykkefeen, I am actually finding unity-3d more stable :) not sure if statistically relevant, but I have a few glitches on the unity-2d and I stil hadn't in unity-3d
 lykkefeen, homewer, I am sticking to unity-2d because I use BOINC and the GPU for scientific computing, so having an hardware-accelerated desktop is unpratical
 lykkefeen, Nvidia 270's on a Fermi GT430, but most of glitches occur while using flash player with firefox
 lykkefeen: Not sure if its an unity-2d issue, because too many variables changed:  Firefox version, Ubuntu version, even the Flash version: I still have the default plugin, I am not sure its the nonfree one. As you can see, I am not a statistically relevant case, but I am loving Unity...
 why everything I read is double?
 no, other rooms are fine. Its just this room: each message is displayed twice
 but he does reach the grub item 'rescue mode' I guess
 baskak: upgrades are being a curse
 baskak: just be prepared in case something fail. have a burned ISO of the 11.04, backup of data, home and so on...
 baskak, try ubuntu forums and google, I bet the online community will be able to help you
 wolfreak: just use 2 hard disks in raid :)
 or simply 2 hard disks manually mirrorer
 jeniffer82: what do you mean by no frame?
 jeniffer82: of course not. If something didn't went well after upgrade (common occurrence) then burn an iso of 11.04, backup your data and do a fresh install
 Lcawte: Thats not good. We are talking about an ubuntu problem I guess, but make your first priority to backup your data as IF your hardware should fail for whatever reason, your data would be lost anyway. This applies to Windows, to Linux and to every other Os.
 dd214, first selet a user
 dd214: then menu should appear, as long as the password box appear
 dd214: It will work ;)
 zvacet, the menu in wich you can choose gnome or unity appear only when you select a user from the list...
 zvacet: wait for he to report back ;)
 burn iso, reboot, start the livecd
 then it will ask you if you want to install or just upgrade
 fachher: excess number of simultaneous connections maybe?
 gare: I am a power user and like it. Its nead and orderly, and I like it even if I am not a noob
 flametai1: what error does it give you?
 flametai1: upgrade I bet
 flametai1: I can't solve your issue, but I had a similar one while upgrading from 10.10. Stuck on login, it gave me a 'module is unknown' error after typing credentials and pressing login. I spent about 1 hour looking for solutions in a forum but just spent 15 minutes making a fresh install
 flametai1: Hope you get the idea
 flametai1: I am not sure because I never did an USB install, but I've read that USB-boot is not always possible with older bioses. Maybe I am wrong, but I suggest you to check your bios to see if you see any related option and enable it eventually
 takeshi I heard gnome3 + unity might cause problems
 why empathy often do not show in the launcher'
