 Isn't SDL installed with Ubuntu?
 I just tried to compile a game but it said I didn't have SDL
 How can I install SDL?
 PythonPup, how do I add it?
 PythonPup, I had 11.04 beta 2, which had it, but I just did a clean install 11.04 and it does not seem to
 PythonPup, doing now
 PythonPup, now what?
 PythonPup, It shows libsdl1.2debian as being installed
 PythonPup, what is the website to paste things for this chat? I'll just post what terminal is saying

 I'll spend some hours ding things that should take 10 seconds with a functional OS tomorrow I guess
 I just turned on my computer and all the icons, dialogue boxes, top bar, etc were all different
 This is a clean install of 11.04, and no system preferences were touched
