 Maimster: Awesome!  How about you? :)
 Maimster: Good to hear!  I'm just winding down at work, hoping to pack my things up and head home in the next hour or so!
 Maimster: Yeah, Ubuntu's been very good to me thus far!
 Maimster: What do you do?
 Maimster: Ahh well, that sounds interesting!
 Maimster: That's great...created your own job!  I did that once.  Worked out well for a year or two and then moved on to other things.
 Maimster: Anyway, we're going to get yelled at for visiting and not talking strictly Ubuntu support, so we probably better get back on topic, hehe! :)
 Maimster: I'm also in #ubuntu-offtopic
 vibhav: Hmm...let me think...Nope!  But if I think long enough, I'm sure I can come up with *something*!
 vibhav: Haha...yeah! :)
 Jessica175: I've had great success with vmware server on some of the older Ubuntu LTS's.
 Jessica175: I also run vmware fusion on my Macs and it's a dream!
 Jessica175: So my opinion is that vmware is quite good!
 tyler_d: Why did you modify openvpn's init script?
 tyler_d: Well, *sometimes* that has to be done for legit reasons.  I was just curious!
 tyler_d: On one of my server installs, I had to mod mine in order to have some custom preparatory scripts execute just before starting the openvpn process.
 tyler_d: I see. None of my openvpn installs are recent enough to use upstart so my init scripts won't help you.
 tyler_d: If all else fails, you can --purge remove the package and then reinstall it.  That will replace the init script with a default version.  Just remember to *always* make a backup of the file before you start messing with it.  It's a good habit to get in to.  I forced myself to start doing that over 10 years ago when I first started learning Linux and I still do it now! :)
 tyler_d: You can purge the current install with, "sudo apt-get --purge remove openvpn" and once it finishes, do, "sudo apt-get install openvpn" and that *should* get you back to default configs, init scripts, etc for openvpn.
 tyler_d: welcome :)
 pindropper: Maybe you are referring to sourcing a file, like a script. example:  . /path/to/script
 pindropper: You could also do, "source /path/to/script" and it would accomplish the same.
 pindropper: I think so, yes.
 pindropper: No.  It's equivalent to sourcing.  You can't source a binary in that way.
 pindropper: Because it doesn't make sense!
 pindropper: I'm not sure why you want to attempt to source a binary file.
 pindropper: Think of it like a method of importing the code in some other file, into the currently executing script.
 pindropper: It's commonly done in other scripting languages like perl, php, etc.
 pindropper: Sort of, yes. Think of multiple scripts utilizing a common data source or library.  Sourcing is perfect for that.
 pindropper: But yes, it's also commonly used to source a common environment file.
 pindropper: welcome :)
