 HyperShock, what is "super" ?
 HyperShock, i don't see it that way
 HyperShock, it is like when some aplication go in system tray that is no more in unity
 HyperShock, and now i can;t pick it up and save my work
 HyperShock, escott its not in unity bar, when i click on new geany it just open new geany
 escott, i can't alt-tab it
 HyperShock, just hit the "_" minimize button
 HyperShock, it's over, my work is gonne, there is no more geany process in the system monitor :/ ... i don't know what happend
 HyperShock, i have tried again and i was able to alt-tab it alltought i didn't saw it anywhere and it did not dock in unity's bar.
 HyperShock, no,
 HyperShock, my work is mostly saved and part that gonne is not so big, but anyway, this should not happen

 HyperShock, there is some problem with my system alone, probably
