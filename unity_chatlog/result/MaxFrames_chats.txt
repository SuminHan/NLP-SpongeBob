 hello
 I have a netbook with an internal ssd hdd and an sd card, winxp is on the hdd while ubuntu + grub are on the sd card
 the sd card is set to boot first, so when I turn the netbook on with the sd card inserted, I get grub
 if I boot the netbook w/o the sd card, winxp boots (no grub)
 now I want to remove grub from the sd card; how do I go about doing that?
 knock knock
 a guy looking for help about removing grub :P
 haqzor7: "a site"?
 sweet
 so first of all; it's done from linux I guess, not from windows?
 ok thx
 hello
 I have updated from 10.10 to 11.04 and now I have a problem with grub
 I need to choose a different default OS in the grub menu
 in 10.10, I had solved with a nifty app called startup-manager
 now it is still installed, but does not work anymore
 can you help?
 user82: thanks; there is surely a commandline way, but I do prefer the gui
 re
 ok it kinda worked, but now I'd like to understand why StartUp-Manager does not work anymore, why it hasn't been uninstalled during the upgrade, and why I can't seem to be able to sudo apt-get remove it
 it might be my setup, but on my eeepc, ubuntu has become slower and less usable with every new version... :(
 with v9, it outperformed winxp; now it takes 3 times as much to boot, for example
 curiosity killed performance on my netbook ;)
 so, can anyone shed some light for me on startup-manager?
