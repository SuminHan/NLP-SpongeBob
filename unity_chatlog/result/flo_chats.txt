 what about the energy consumption of memory? say, running latexila uses only 5,7 MB, the same docs in gedit take 47,5 MB, however. is there a difference in the energy software "consumes"?
 escott, what's clocking?

 ! clock
 ! clocking
 !clock
 escott, i think i understand. so energy saving is a little difficult with the pc turned on, isn't it? (except for the screen, perhaps)
 !powertop
 escott, thank you! that's a point to start from. just browsed a bit through ubuntusers.de on those energy-saving hints.
