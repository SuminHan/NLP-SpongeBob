 Morning, all. I have a discrete NVIDIA video card which works well under 10.10, but there's also an integrated Intel card that Ubuntu isn't recognising / detecting. Any pointers for getting this installed ?

 Incarus6, it's about 750 lines, sorry : http://pastebin.com/6kLDH0Gj
 Incarus6, yes, it's a 1155 socket. So the graphics adaptor isn't supported ?
 Incarus6, I was just reading that one, yes. So... I won't be able to get the graphics working at all ?
 Incarus6, apparently, the latest Ubuntu has alpha support for Sandy Bridge. Yay. :P
 Incarus6, I misread that. The latest alpha Ubuntu release has support for it. The release is no longer in alpha, but full stable. I might have a chance if I upgrade my distro.
 Incarus6, thanks. I've tried upgrading to 11.04 recently, but it failed. I'll try again. Something about a network error...
 Incarus6, that's a major pain...
 Incarus6, I haven't touched repositories on this install.
 Incarus6, selected another server and will try it now. Will let you know.
 JohnFlux, I failed to get the UK server to do anything. I selected "best server" for an upgrade, and it worked fine when it gave me another one.
 JohnFlux, in Settings, I think it's the Sources tab, perhaps.
 JohnFlux, there's an option to select "Best Server" which tests all of them and returns the best choice.
 Hey everyone. I've just upgraded to 11.04, and when I boot, my screen just stays black. I'm now under an earlier kernel which seems to work, but I got an error saying I didn't have the hardware to run Unity, and I should select something else. Any ideas ?
 somethinginteres, I assume so. i5, GTX 560, 8 GB RAM. It's a new box.
 NyvenZA, are you running under an older kernel for now, then ?
 NyvenZA, those are the drivers I need, too.
 ActionParsnip, NyvenZA, trying nvidia-current, will let you know.
 ActionParsnip, installing nvidia-current allowed me to boot into my new kernel. Thanks very much.
 ActionParsnip, now I need to install the dev drivers instead, and see if it holds out :P
 Also going to switch back to Classic Desktop, I think...
 ActionParsnip, got it working now, thank you.
 Does anyone know about integrated graphics support on 11.04 for a 1155 chip ?
 Anyone know much about 1155 graphics cards under Natty ?
 Silly question, but, is there some equivalent of the Device Manager ? I'm not sure my second video card is being detected and failing, or not being detected at all.
