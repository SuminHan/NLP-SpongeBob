 I need help. I have xchat open right now, and it isn't showing up in unity to my left. So if I minimize xchat, I can't find it. Ill click the xchat icon again and instead of bringing me back to my current session, it opens up a new one. There doesn't seem to be any window management that I can see. Also, I have dropbox. I open the dropbox folder and right click a file I want to share, and there doesn't seem to be an option to share a link with
 someone. Defeats the purpose of having dropbox! Anyone help me out?
 blue1 alt+tab works.
 But isnt there any sort of visual app I can use?
 blue1 what about my dropbox problem?
 I open the dropbox folder and go to select a file. I right click to try and grab a public link to share the file and there is no option to do so blue1
 blue1 im running unity
 Alright I need help with something. I have a file in my dropbox that I want to share with someone. I click the icon in the tray in the upper right. I go into my public folder and right click the file I want to share. There is no menu option there for me to get a public link so that I may share the file. Any idea what the issue could be?

 Is anyone else experiencing lag in 11.04? It takes a little longer to open programs, and also facebook navigating through pictures seems like it takes forever.
