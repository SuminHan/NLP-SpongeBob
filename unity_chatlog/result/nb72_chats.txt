 Am I the only one who noticed quicken listed on the ubuntu website? Is that now available in the software center?
 Can anybody confirm that quicken is now available in the software center?
 wazzup, it is, I'm pretty sure instructions are on ubuntu.com
 wazzup, I was thinking from, not on.  You can run it like a live CD from the stick, but I'm not sure if you can fully run it from a stick.
