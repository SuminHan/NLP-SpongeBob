 I just installed 11.04 off usb (alongside windows) and it won't boot, it goes to busybox shell... how do i uninstall and tell it to use a 1tb partition?
 snikker: unplug and replug
 GrimmVarg: what's it doing?
 snikker: ifconfig eth0 down && ifconfig eth0 up && dhcpcd eth0
 GreeNtooTH: sorry :-)
 GrimmVarg: what's your layout? norway?
 snikker: i made a mistake you want to type dhclient eth0
 GrimmVarg: it's a bug in xkeyboard-config, there's no fix yet that i can see
 11.04 doesn't ever get to desktop after install, what can i do to troubleshoot?
 busybox/boot errors say ata5:link is too slow to respond, please be patient... ubuntu itself never loads... what can i do?
 and a bunch of device not ready errors, 6 partitions eventually show up
 can someone help me mount /dev/sda5/6/7 from busybox ash?
 well, i can't get 11.04 to work on my computer at all, even in vbox
 bear_: quadcore athlon II 4 gigs of ram 1TB partition for ubuntu
 bear_: yeah the installer and liveusb work but it won't install, and the new GUI doesn't work in vbox
 rather, it installs, but goes straight to busybox ash prompt
 bear_: update grub? isn't the installer supposed to update if i am connected to the internet?
 like the opposite of LTE 4g
 there's LTE and wimax
 clearwire uses wimax, etc
 herol3oy: put it on a usb drive and boot with it in
 xs3ns3: install gnome if you don't like the new desktop...
 xs3ns3: it's not like windows where you're locked into a GUI
 herol3oy: on the ubuntu website if you click "get ubuntu" it says "use usb - show me how"
 xs3ns3: i think that's the netbook desktop
 xs3ns3: at least, they looked the same to me
 herol3oy: unplug your internet then... then it can't download. or, put it on a USB drive like i said and boot from it, and run the normal upgrade that won't break everything
 does ubuntu have an issue booting past the 1TB mark?
 llutz: +i
 wqas 6.10 the last LTS before lucid?
 zounds.
 cloud out!
 well, natty dist upgrade works on the cloud
 :-)
