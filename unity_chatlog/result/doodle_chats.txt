 Hello, I am trying to install Ubuntu 11.04, but in the add partition section's "Use as" menue, I don't see NTFS file system which I need. How I can use that file system?
 maco: but no way to do that now?
 maco: I know that.
 maco: I don't wanna install Ubuntu there, I just want to spare the 45 GB space to another drive which I need in NTFS.
 maco: you said, I can do that right? If so, which file system should I select now?
 maco: okay, I will do that. Thanks!
 maco: the type of that partition will be logical or primary?
 maco: I just want to use it as a regular drive, primary will be better for that, or logical? I have many other partitions already.
 maco: I have more than 3 primary already.
 doodle: most probably, I am not sure. I did it long time ago.
 maco: okay then.
 maco: okay, going to install now. Thanks! :)
 maco: it asks me to select a mount point for the partition, and I selected FAT32, and the mount point is /dos and /windows, which one should I select?
 maco: okay.
 maco: there is no other option but /dos and /windows
 maco: no. :S
 maco: you there?

 Sorry, typo. :S
 taglass: I see nothing.
 taglass: it does not give any output.
 taglass: it does.
 taglass: but I have no name for that partion so I tried sudo blkid UUID /dos
 taglass: that gives no output.
 taglass: okay.
 taglass: here: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=5ve2jLCb
 taglass: the /dev/sda11: UUID="065C-DB02" TYPE="vfat" is the problem.
 taglass: I got this: mount: /dev/sda11 already mounted or /dos busy mount: according to mtab, /dev/sda11 is already mounted on /dos
 taglass: but I want it under /media
 taglass: also I see nothing in /dos
 taglass: I can't unmount now with right click, it says, "umount: only root can unmount /dev/sda11 from /media/dos"
 taglass: actually, no. I want it like other direves. easy to mount and unmount
 taglass: and I tried to formate it in NTFS.
 taglass: okay, thanks!
 taglass: most probably I made this error in installation, I want to re-install, what should I select there (after deleting and reassigning) to mount in /media, I see only 2 options there /dos and /windows
 taglass: then it says, your drive will be unused!
 taglass: shoul I ignore that message and go fo installation?
 taglass: okay, will do, thanks!
