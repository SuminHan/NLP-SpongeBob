 has anyone run into an issue with crypt() on natty?
 im pretty stuck on an issue with crypt() - both my jabber server and any program i try to write complain about crypt() being undefined...and i just can't seem to find what might have happened in the upgrade to cause this
 Having some problems with crypt and Jabberd2 following an upgrade to natty...
 basically - if i try to use crypted passwords in the config - it crashes and complaints about an undefined symbol crypt
 anyone around here maybe have any experience in this area?
