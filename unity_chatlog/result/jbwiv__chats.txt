 guys, on Unity, I have the little blue triangle thingy up at the top left indicating some sort of notification, but I can't find what's triggering it. Does this thing log anywhere?

 lcb: ok, thanks
 Guys, I've verified that on all four machines that I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.10, /var/log/messages is no longer being written to. It's just empty. Any ideas what could cause this?
 trism, interesting. so where do messages which would have gone to /var/log/messages now go?
 trism, do they now go to /var/log/syslog?
 trism, ok, thank you!
