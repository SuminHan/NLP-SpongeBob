 Hi, I'm having some slight problems with my new 11.04 upgrade.
 Basically, I can't find a program to change the settings of Dash
 Uhm
 So, uh, changing DASH's settings?
 rimo0: What's your problem?
 rimo0: Uuuh, no idea
 escott: It's not I that have the problem
 escott: My problem is my inability to find a goddamn way to change the settings of dash
