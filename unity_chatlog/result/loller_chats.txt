 ##namespace is the cool place to hang out. You can find most of the cool people there. In ##namespace you can just chill and do whatever and totally relax. "Take it easy" is the ##namespace motto, for example, that's how laid back it is there. Show up if you want to have a good time. Another good reason to show up is if you want to hang out with friends.
