 anyone have any luck getting Rune of Magic to work?
 Runes
 im trying so hard to get Runes of Magic to work, everything is good, but my screen stays black, i saw a picture once, but i cant seem to even get that repeated
 you cant
 <isarl>you cant not == supported yet
 give it another month somone will find a way!
 yeah, itll happen, there are plenty of people wanting to do that
 but the way i see it, why change your GUI from classic to natty on your release and knowing the huge mods i have done to my old screen, id have to say that was a bad call
 my thoughts is that they should have went with an ultra easy custimisable desktop
 all set with the tools to let any user design their desktop in a smooth and seamless way
 yep
 <spicytaco>not so loud but clear:)
 they could easily have made the GUI ultra custom and offered ends to can
 for support
 im just sick, i cant play Runes of Magic:(
 Herc if you update, you might not find it all that
 im thinking on going back to 10.10, until they open this whale up
 anyone know where i could go for some help getting Runes of Magic working?

 Angelic whats ur Wifi adapter, and what driver are you using?
 ok are you using it through Wireless Windows Drivers?
 Angelic^
 Angelic open it up, and the driver name will be in there
 Angelic open ur terminal and type lsusb             <that will tell you what adapter you have
 robin0800 lspci will only give you pci info, lsusb will give you usb info
 ok, take that online and google it to see if theres a way to get it to run native, thats the best:)
 yeah, sorry:)
 flodine check your graphics driver
 Angelic google it and see if u can run in Native
 flodine whats ur graphics card?
 heh.. thats why...
 flodine ok, heres what u do, ru in Natty now?
 flodine Search for System Settings then inside there look for Additional Drivers
 flodine use the nVIDIA 173 driver
 flodine if its an option
 flodine then youll be welcome to Natty:)
 flodine then get Compiz
 flodine trust me you will want that:)
 flodine just use Applications>Search>Compiz
 Does anyone know how to get Regnum online to run in windowed mode?
 KM0201!! Hey buuuuuddy!
 KM0201 i have been telling Angelic to search google and try to run the usb adapter native if its possible, thats what i have to do to get rid of that, but i got a different adapter
 <bull9408> easy
 <bull9408> just search for the app, run it the right click on it and check the keep in luancher
 oh, uh thats a good question
 thats why i went to classic mode
 <anthonyl> uh what is wrong?
 <anthonyl> uh what is wrong?
 <Thedemon007>hi
 <Thedemon007>be careful if you have gnome3 or anything like that you dont want to update
 <anthonyl>use the 173 driver if your having freezing ussues
 <anthonyl> go to additional drivers and switch to 173, trust me its nVIDIA acting up
 i think that when they bumped Gnome3 they shouldnt have, they should have worked it so you could load either one
 dagon im looking to do the same thing
 is there a way to get more plugins for compiz?
