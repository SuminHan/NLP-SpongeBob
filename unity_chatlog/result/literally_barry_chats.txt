 Hey all, just got a quick question about the Ubuntu 11.04 installation process?
 I've booted into the Live CD, and run the "Install Ubuntu" icon on the desktop.
 It gets to the page where it says "Preparing Ubuntu installation" page, I click next, and nothing happens. grub-mount maxes the CPU (see here: http://i.imgur.com/CmLxd.png) and I've been sitting here about 15 minutes waiting for some progress. Any suggestions?
 Yeah, I've checked, the torrent also did re-checking, and it matched.
 boot: you only need to set a password for root to enable it (iirc) like this: sudo passwd root
 ActionParsnip: I am using a CD.
 ActionParsnip: Sorry, I wasn't fully aware of the rules here.
 ActionParsnip: I did not. I'm going to let this idle, return to another system and do that. Cheers for the help. I'll be back if I don't have any success. =P
 ActionParsnip: RAM is tested, it's ECC. This system is only about a month old.
 I'm going to re-burn slower. Thanks for the advice ActionParsnip.
