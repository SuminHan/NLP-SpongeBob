 hello,, anyone?
 can someone help me with transmission pleaase?
 quant transmission wont work, tried to delete the config folder, nothing, the ports are all set and open, the router is configured, Vuze started working now, but not transmission
 quant, its simply not downloading/uploading anything, not even connecting to peers/seeds host unreachable, on all torrents
 quant,  the torrent file loads, but gives a 0 0 peers seeds doesnt connect to anyone
 quant, did that, tried 13 torrents from different sites, all working in vuze non in transmission
 geus, yes
 geus, all open, no firewall
 geus, hmmm,, nop didnt try that, let me give it a whire!
 wait!!!
 it started working now!!!!!!! when i ran it as sudo it started downloading!
 geus, i know,,, it was a hailmerry sorta thing and it worked.. let me check running as normal use
 geus, im getting "Couldn't open "/home/com3/.config/transmission/lock": Permission denied"
 geus, guess what! it just decided to work out of the blue! but thanks for your help :)
 geus, you know whats weirder? tranmission autostarts so it cannot be owned by root., that doesnt make any sense, but its working cant complain :)
 geus, nopm starts normally
