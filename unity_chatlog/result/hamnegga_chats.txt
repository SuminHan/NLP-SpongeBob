 you need to install the plugins packages for compiz
 anyone here use pyrit with the latest available kernel?
 Dr_Willis, man up and use the real nvidia drivers
 download mplayer plugin for firefox ShawnRisk
 c4pt did compiz really break or did you not have a startup item for it anymore, like compiz.real --replace
 strange, even with driver workingn still
 c4pt, I would try recompiling my driver manually, since you probably are using a different one with an updated kernel
 champ__ you were the one I meant to say download mplayer plugin for firefox
 mkdri
 mkdir I mean
 yeah, your just enabling a plugin that it can't handle c4pt, you need to find out how to clear your plugin selections or remove, purge your compiz packages and replace
 why does everyone insist on attempting to upgrade instead of reinstalling, your bound for trouble
 bbiab?
 you need to enable window decoration plugin c4pt
 c4pt think a little, move windows plugin maybe?
 Yeah, I only noticed it in my last install (having to re-enable all the plugins in compiz)
 c4pt:  what?
 c4pt did you enable the move windows plugin?
 may need to also select resize window, etc.
 rpk, maybe you need to setup port forwarding on your router
 no problem
 there are many different scenarios for that issue.  Are you trying a dns resolve?  Do you use dns services that need to be refreshed?  Maybe your public ip has changed, etc.
 maybe you need to chown your apache directory or whatever service your running
 you could just have the interface you want setup correctly in interfaces and then update-rc.d for networking
