 hi
 i have a problem with the installation of ubuntu on my laptop. (described here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1742929&highlight=1520 )
 now i tried to follow "dinos" instructions, but i cant find a xorg.conf file in my /etc directory, any ideas?
 eamon: yes i looked there
 there is no xorg.conf
 eamon: how? just a blank file?
 rgr, eamon: ok thx, not sure that an empty file does much
 :)
 rgr: nvidia GT8600M GT
 rgr: i cant run that, i cant read a thing on that installation. im currently online with a lubuntu 10.10 livecd so that i can go online, and mount the wubi root.disk image
 is there a way to install the nivida drivers by just mounting the ubuntu partition from another system?
 eamon yes
 eamon: the problem is i cant access the system. i'm only able to mount the partition from within a livecd i booted
 eamon: the screen is unreadable (see screenshot here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1742929&highlight=1520 )
 eamon: sure, at this point i try everything :)
 eamon: ok thanks, i'll try
