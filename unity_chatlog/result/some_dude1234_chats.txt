 hi all
 I just upgraded from ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04 and surprise surprise, the most important thing stopped working (wireless). I have an Intellinet USB Adapter for the wlan. It worked fine in 10.10 and also here in 11.04. Networkmanager does show me the ESSID's around but I cannot connect to my WPA/PSK encrypted accesspoint. Any hints or further information needed, I would appreciate your help. Thank you
