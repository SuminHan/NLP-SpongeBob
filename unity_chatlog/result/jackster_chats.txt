 something strange is happening under vmware fusion with Natty - when I log in it tells me my system can't run Unity and I get a normal Gnome desktop with the dark theme, then after about 40 seconds the bars along the top and bottom change from the black look to some sort of Windows 9x style appearance - anyone heard of this?
 it seems like there should be a better way than cron...
