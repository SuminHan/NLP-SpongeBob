 hello
 what up ? there is no answer
 very simple my question Pici let me explain you again
 i got a serial number of one my hard disk, which is present on one computer, i got 3 pc all 3 pc are in ubuntu, and also 3 pc are in a same network
 my question is simply how to IDENTIFY  my hard disk location ( the presence of my hard disk in which computer) from the command  line
 to able to find my hard disk
 is it clear now ? Pici
 but i don't want to run that command in each individual computer Pici that's why i m talking about all the 3 computer on a same network qin
 i don't want to ssh to each one
 just wanna discover that functionality
 fi that possible
 then how nagios get information without sshing to any computer  ? Pici qin High_Priest
 so it is possible ?
 i don't have any experience with snmp
 i know that method don't worry High_Priest , but it is not what i m looking for
 so if i understand correctly, if nagios is present on all 3 compter what  i have to do to find my disk ?
 from the command line ?
 how to check if snmp is present on my computer or not ?
 how to check if snmp is present on my computer or not ? High_Priest
 yes it is present snmpd , Pici
