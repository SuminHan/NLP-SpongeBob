 what a fail unity
 dsathe: it's better the classic desktop, i know you can choose but don't put it as default if you want to make linux popoular, it's a fail
 i don't understand, ubunty has a community, why they choice to put unity as default?  i don't think the community agree to this
 they ruin the good work of the last years inho
 dsathe: the normal user, the one that try linux for the first time doesn't understant what is that unity, it doesn't know how to disable, it saw this = this is linux
 i don't get it, there was like a pool, a discussion about this,  how this come out?
 well i don't want to critic the work of other people, thanks for the work of ubuntu anyway, but just put this unity as an option not as default, that's all
