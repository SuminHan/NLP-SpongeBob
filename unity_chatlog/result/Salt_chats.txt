 anyone else noticed a lack of nbr despite there being a link to it from the main site?
 hypetech, netbook remix
 http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/alternative-download has a link to it
 releases does not have it
 that was hardly a flood :p
 hypetech, ah thanks
 then it should be removed from the page ;)
 Pici, sweet

 especially since we planned on demoing it at lfnw this weekend alongside server and desktop
