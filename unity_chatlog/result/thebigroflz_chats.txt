 hi guys, im new to ubuntu, and I need some help please
 I don't want to be asked to enter my keyring password everytime to enable the wireless, but the option is faded
 like when I log back in, the "automatically unlock..." option is faded and cant be set
 anyone know how to fix/enable this?
 ohsix, yes ubuntu logs me in automatically everytime. so theres no way to have both then?
 ohsix, thank you, I found the option, let me test by rebooting
 ohsic, it worked!
 hey are any of you guys good with printers?
 Im having a headache setting mine up
 How can I install my Lexmark x1150 printer in Ubuntu 11?
