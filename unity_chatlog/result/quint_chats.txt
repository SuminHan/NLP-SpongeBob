 so, im running lubuntu (lxde) cant seem to get emesene to work.. im on 11.04 now when i was 10.10 i could run it clean
 lxde is fantastic
 took a sec to get used to
 what is this kernel panic you speak of?
 pcmanfm is the wayy
 say now, how do i go about installing the java environment and icedtea ?
 (forgot how)
 thanks ! :)
 did you do a distro upgrade ?
 if your using gdm you can still choose your last gnome interface rather than unity
 well
 doesnt really matter if you use gdm actually
