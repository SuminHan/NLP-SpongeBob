 Hi guys. I wanted to report an issue: when I boot Ubuntu 11.04, it stops loading. And doing nothing, until I press ENTER. It happen on boot screen (this bronze background, and nothing else, even Ubuntu logo). Where I should report it, which package to report (Launchpad?). I'm using Nvidia proprietary driver.

 konaya, how to disable it? splash off or something, in GRUB?
 zniavre, kill gnome-panel app
 thanks, konaya, botcity. Also in my foreign ubuntu forum I saw posts from people with same problem. I will investigate it later
