 when doing "sudo reboot" or "sudo shutdown -r now", it tells me system going for blabla.. and kills ssh.. yet the computer never reboots, just sits @ black screen. Why?
 maxagaz: did you set http proxy? youre supposed to set SOCKS proxy and nothing else
 maxagaz: and what ssh command did you run
 maxagaz: and then socks proxy localhost:9999?
 maxagaz: weird, should work..
 maxagaz: lol :p
 maxagaz: yeah i thought so too :-)
 maxagaz: yw :)
 Logan_: it's not even possible to run that anymore
 Logan_: oh hmm dunno about ubuntu but some other systems have protection for that :)
 takatori: let me guess. it doesn't work?
 takatori: no idea :p
 you don't have a dvd drive? :D
 Unity is horrible tbh and they should have something else for the next release :/
 miceiken: o/ :D
 RavenHursT: rc.local?
 RavenHursT: probably, i havent bothered to look up what they even mean :p
 RavenHursT: cool :)
 marcelC: do you mean aircrack-ng?
 marcelC: well use that then instead
