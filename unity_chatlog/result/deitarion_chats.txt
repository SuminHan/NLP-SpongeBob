 Did someone make a change to APT recently without passing it through quality control review or something? My mother did what she says was a "partial upgrade" a couple of days ago and found her Digikam missing (She's using Lubuntu with KDE bits) and now, when I try to re-install it, it refuses because things like kdebase-runtime aren't going to be installed rather than just pulling them in like it should.
 Someone needs to write an IRC daemon which can implement "Too many nicks. You're kickbanned." BEFORE passing the message on to everyone.
 Does anyone know of a way to ask apt-get for a list of which repo each broken package is coming from?
 Aha! A website suggested trying with aptitude instead and it gave me an answer.
 When aptitude suggested the same solution as apt-get and I picked "no", it then suggested downgrading half of KDE from maverick-security to maverick so the other half (from maverick) would accept it.
 How do I change the framebuffer resolution on 11.04? It's giving me "Frequency out of range" on a 1440x900 widescreen and that makes fixing X11 troublesome when it breaks.
