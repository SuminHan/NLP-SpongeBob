 seriously why does 11.04 take forever to damn boot
 fuck natty
 ohsix: why does the new version of udev choke on my sata controller
 and/or the kernel for that matter
 GTK3 can blow me, but we get firefox 4 which is pretty cool
 I am running a GTX 480 in 11.04
 so far its working
 ohsix: lemme check
 OK, my sata controller is a ATI technologies SB7x0 8x0,etc....
 I don't like this new scroll tab thingy either, how do I get rid of it
