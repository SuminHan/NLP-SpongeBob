 Grrr system bell isn't working anyone have any idea why?
 anyone know why I can't turn on the system bell, and how to get sliders visible in gtk2 apps?
 WTH is pcspkr not found as a valid kernel module on natty
 I can't enable system bell, or make gtk app sliders visible at all times any ideas?
 in a terminal
 celthunder: terminal I am running pulseaudio but its configured to use pc speaker and worked before Natty
 celthunder: I don't want to comeout via the speakers, I want it to use the beep on pc case
 celthunder: gets better I can't even modprobe the damned module I need
 great now it found it
 but still no beep
 How do I disable the disappering reapperaring slider in gtk
 something chaged pan and other gtk2 apps you have to hold your mouse and hover to make the slider appear now how do I fix it to the way it was
 how do I disable the now you see it now you don't slider bars...
