 I need help changing the resolution of my tty console.
 teletypetypewriter
 what is this an iq test
 All i know is my console does not produce a desireable resolution and owuld like to fix it
 Before nvidia drivers it would boot with nice crisp font and the tty's would be in the correct resolution
 but after the nvidia drivers the tty consoles and boot is not in a proper resolution
 all im asking is if anyone knows how to fix it as I have been around my ass a billion times googling it
 im going to give xrandr a try
 11.04
 so it is unchangeable thats not right
 too big, as in the dpi is off. This would be because of resolution
 your right im rockin the 795 vesa. thanks jordan_U I hate propriatary drivers....
 does anyone know how to configure vsync on the open source drivers
 nah jordan, highest possible for vesa is 795 and that is what ubuntu is running as max for the propriatary. this is why everytime I try and change it it does not change because it is  already 795.
