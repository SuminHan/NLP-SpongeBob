 Hello :), I was wondering if anyone has any experaince with .desktop files?
 thegoodcushion: I'm not an expert, but google "cups ubuntu"
 thegoodcushion: Then perhaps try and install your printer from that
 My .desktop file that's playing up is: http://pastebin.com/cD3bAq5i   I don't know what's wrong. x-wallpaper-changer is an app I wrote, and the command I set Exec to works fine in the terminal (which is why I've set Terminal to true). Any ideas?
 Someone should make a version of tux that's half-God half-penguin :)
 I know that was coming ;)
 Not God, the offtopic thing
 Okay, on topic, does anyone have any idea why my .desktop file isn't working?
 BlouBlou: I think in the menu he's clicking on a directory, and it's opening rythembox
 Can anyone point me in the direction of a forum where I might recieve some help with my .desktop file?
 Cube``: I think there's a command to upgrade your ubuntu version :)
 Cube``: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/upgrade
 drewby: I don't know, but maybe in default programs? Or try right-clicking a directory and select "open with" then choose natulis, the file browser
 lylanthia: I think so, but people tend to shoot you if you say something that's outta place :)
 lylanthia: it's deadly in here ;)
 lylanthia: It did for me :)
 lylanthia: buuut I don't know the technical answer, but I assume so :)
 no problems :)
 jaypue: No, sorry
