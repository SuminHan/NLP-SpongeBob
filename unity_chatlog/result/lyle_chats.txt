 why don't i have the "grub" command installed by default? and apparently i have a "grub-pc" package that conflicts with "grub" so I can't install it?
 hey is there some way to have the unity launchbar use a different icon theme from nautilus and the notification area, etc.?
 xangua, what i'm asking is, can the launcher use a different icon theme than the rest of ubuntu?
 xangua, i want to use Humanity on the launcher and Faenza everywhere else.
 mbrigdan, try doing a compiz --replace ?
 mbrigdan, oh yeah, it's not stuck, that's compiz running now. do alt+f2 and then do compiz --replace in that launcher.
 mbrigdan, can you pastebin the output from when you ran it in the terminal?
 mbrigdan, do alt+f2 again and this time try metacity --replace
 mbrigdan, not sure, just wanted to see if they showed up under metacity
 mbrigdan, you can go back to comiz by doing compiz --replace again
 MadDecent, ohai
 mbrigdan, should be in Administration
 mbrigdan, if one of them says "experimental" then that one is nouveu, not the official nvidia driver
 mbrigdan, that's probably the best idea. did you upgrade to 11.04 or do a fresh install?
 yeah, that'd do it
