 wow the mirrors for the upgrade seems to be pretty fucked. i'm downloading with 60kb/s on a 15/15mbit fiber cable line
 Why is the update to Natty so extremely slow(100kb/s average). I can theoretically do 1.85mb/s, and I usually max it with the update manager
 oCean: ye, maby. but should be possible to have to options to switch mirrors, so the traffic can be dealt better between the mirrors
