 cranch,  if your ip address is in /etc/hosts it will use dns name I think
 cranch if you put an ip adress and its dns name in /etc/hosts rather than typeingthe ip in you can simply type the dns name
 cranch isnt that what its supposed to do
 cranch, try the apche channel perhaps I dunnu much about it
 np cya
 Ziber problem exactly?

 ziber terminal $alsamixer lol
 ziber type alsamixer in a terminal window or tty session
 is there any way a remote can type letters in x with the 1 -9 buttons
 ziber if alsamixer will not open you audio isnt installed correctly i would say
 look in synaptic try and play a sound using aplay etc if these thing show problems go to the ubuntu forums multimedia thread it has setup of everything in there so you can play any and everything and set upof sound devices and video and dvd etc
 Bronz start to a prompt and remove type sudo xconfig and then type startx that should give tyou basic grahpics then google how to install your nvidia drivers
 Bronz are you trying to run from a live cd or install from alive cd
 if running from a live cd do not choose nvidia driver in setup
 Bronz often graphics fail because they are not set up correctly and leave you with no screen. To avoid this use default video drivers and they will work. This will get your system up and running have aplay then google how to install nvidia drivers and do so accordingly
 Also rileyp: what do you mean "remove type sudo xconfig"?  to remove any nvidia created xorg.conf which most probably is casing your x screen to fail  by typeing sudo xconfig a std xorg.conf will be created using std driversl
 bronx do not select nvidia
 ziber http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=766683
 ziber that will fix any audio issue you have :D
 Bronz If live cd will not boot for you and your not selcting nvidia I cant help sorry. I never use livecd.
 Bronz at screen freeze you could try CTRL+alt +f1 and see what happens you may end up in a tty session meaning ubuntu has started up completely but gdm has failed thenits just a matter of resolving that
 Bronz,  are you trying latest ubuntu?
