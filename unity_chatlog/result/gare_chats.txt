 DrManhattan:  the easiest way I found to switch from 11.04 to classic gnome is to install kubuntu-desktop, and select kdm as the default .  This gives options of different desktops ...
 well, please let me know ..
 what happens when you remove default desktop file from /x11 ?
 DrManhattan:  perhaps take a look at this file:  /etc/init/gdm.conf
 DrManhattan: 1st aspect of your question -- To ask for password on login , go to Users , select your user, and then Change password.  Uncheck 'Don't ask for password on login'.
 glad could help
 good morning!!  so .. This link is dead for http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/alternative-download#bt  for ubuntu-11.04-netbook-i386.iso.torrent  .  IS there a netbook edition any longer?  (Thank you for any help.)

 What are odds that 11.04 unity will not run on my original 9" Dell Mini ? ..   :)

 hi -- ok.  I want to believe the Unity is also for 'power users'.  Does anyone else share my hope / have any comments supportive of this belief?  (I read in press how Unity was not designed for power users.. )
