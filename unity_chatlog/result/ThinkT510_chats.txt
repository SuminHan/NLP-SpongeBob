 a111: it works fine for me, but that doesn't help you now does it?
 a111: you could do that with a livecd, no need to reinstall
 WhitePride,

 jetienne: not quite, you can install vms inside 11.04

 jetienne: i didn't mean to insult you, i apologise; but you are misusing the term dedicated
 !gnome3 | sachin
 sachin: you can install it, but its not guaranteed to work and you won't be able to get support if you do install it, as for why they provided a ppa it must have been requested by a few people, but is experimental (use at your own risk)

 dasfefg: do you have a problem that you need help with? if not can you take that to #ubuntu-offtopic

 !grub2 | drdozer
 drdozer: are you at a grub rescue prompt?
 drdozer: shall i walk you through how to boot again?
 drdozer: first do you remember which partition you installed ubuntu to?
 drdozer: no worries, we'll find out
 drdozer: type ls
 drdozer: what do you see?
 drdozer: ok, type ls (hd1,msdos1)/
 drdozer: what do you see?
 drdozer: really? you tried them all?
 drdozer: what does it print out?
 drdozer: excellent, bear with me we'll type some commands..
 drdozer: first type: set prefix=(hd0,1)/boot/grub
 drdozer: then type: set root=(hd0,1)
 drdozer: yeah, it shouldn't display anything yet, next type: insmod linux
 drdozer: ah.. i don't know how to fix that, looks like grub needs to be reinstalled
 drdozer: not from a rescue prompt, as far as i know
 drdozer: no worries, i got stuck at a rescue prompt too, so i found the ubuntu wiki helpful, thats where i was getting the info to help you from
 boot: its recommended you stick to what ubuntu provides

 !brain | mang0
 mang0: 11.04 uses a newer kernel than 10.10 so there are driver updates and whatnot
 OneKorea: you can install ubuntu and access any partitions just fine yes
 np
 P_Kable: you'll need to give more details so that we can figure out your problem
 OneKorea: yes, ubuntu reads and writes ntfs partitions on a full real install, it won't overwrite anything there
 OneKorea: its an easy install process, the hardest part is partitioning, but that is simple when you know how

 LuckyNeo: 11.04 is no longer beta
 LuckyNeo: oops, sorry, misread
 crazyrohila: you'll have to update to 10.10 then to 11.04
 deostroll: maybe look up some documentation of the file structure of linux, it sounds like you are unfamiliar
 iggyology: you could always try any other desktop environment if you don't get along with unity, i prefer xfce myself
