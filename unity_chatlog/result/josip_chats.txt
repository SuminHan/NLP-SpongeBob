 Hello, I installed Uubntu 11.04 and when I start  awesome the only thing I see is a background
 anyone with an idea what causes this?
 edbian: I want to fix the problem, not to log in with a differnet wm
 edbian: no, I am running the 64bit 11.04 Ubuntu. I installed awesome from the official ubuntu repositories
 and I don't want to try other ones, I want awesome to work
 edbian: nope
 I suspect it has soemthing to do with unity. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/metacity/+bug/731329
 but the workarouind propsosed there didn't work for me
 edbian: I'm using my config file that used to work perfectly fine uuntil I upgraded
