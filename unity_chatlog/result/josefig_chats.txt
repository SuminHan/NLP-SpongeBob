 Hello, what may I install to save the battery life in one laptop, with plug works wonderfull but without it is not good enough.
 ?
 NictraSavios, I'm runing the beta version
 i gonna upgrade it at this moment.
 NictraSavios, I configured that, but nothing changed.
 NictraSavios, lol is a dell new brand, on windows my batter works fine about 3hrs
 and on ubuntu works just like 1hr and a half
 maybe the cpu speed
 NictraSavios, 32% for 19 mins? lol
 and Im not compiling or something like that.
 NictraSavios, okay I was thinking on checking something like try to develop something :P
 hello, I want to start my ubuntu on console mode how may I do this ? I mean not in gdm and when I want to start the X doing it by console.
 I have a doubt,  when I turn on the machines all the scripts from /etc/init.d/ are executed ?
 If I want some service not start from the beginning what should I you ?
 xsinick, I am a root, but I mean, I dont want mongodb starts at the beginning because I only use it to develop and sometimes I use it in only 2 projects.
 trism, yes it is :)
 trism, oh I see the mondgo flag manual should be the one, thank you.
