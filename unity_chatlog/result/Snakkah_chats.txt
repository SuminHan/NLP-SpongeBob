 Can anyone tell me how to make ALL tooltips (the little black descriptors that appear in menus and applications) transparent? For now, it seems to only apply to my panel menus.
 EDIT: Nevermind, got it.
 I decided to switch back to 10.04 as I'm not too pleased with the new Unity interface and for stability reasons, but I was wondering if there would be any harm in upgrading to the latest 2.6.38 kernel on my 10.04 install. What do you all think?
 marenostrum, I did that at first, but even there I noticed some annoying Compiz bugs even in the "Classic" interface in the new release. Along with that, multiple burns of the Live CD would not boot into the live environment at all. As far as I'm concerned, Canonical still needs to work out some bugs before I consider 11.04 again.
 inimeg, like I just said, I wasn't too pleased with Natty. I actually downgraded to 10.04 since it's supported until 2013. Hopefully Unity will mature by then. :D
 inimeg, they do allow you to have the old interface though.
 You might consider that. I did and it didn't work for me but oh well lol
 inimeg, I just do that by typing your name.
 lol
 The same thing happened when you typed mine.
 inimeg, yes.
 Mmhmm.
 inimeg, I sent you a message.
 Hi. I'm running 10.04 and trying to get Tomboy to be running at startup so I added it to my Startup Applications. The problem, however, is that the "Search All Notes" box always comes up every time I log on. How do I get Tomboy to just run in the background in the tray and not have that window come up?
 And yes, I know there's a panel app for Tomboy. I just like the systray icon more.
 So I prefer to just have it running at startup.
 I'm using Ubuntu Lucid 10.04, and I want to install "pianobar" It's an application that runs Pandora radio from the command line. It appears that it's only available in the Maverick and Natty repositories though. Would it be safe to get it (and its dependencies) from a Maverick repository even though I'm running Lucid?
 Brandano, I have the backports repo enabled.
 And a PPA seems to be hard to come by for this little program.
 Brandano, it's not in the Lucid backports repo. :/
 Mmm...maybe. I'll let you know what happens. I expect dependency problems though,.
 Brandano, just installed pianobar along with its dependencies (it had two dependencies that installed without a hitch). :D
 Brandano, no. Do I need to chroot?
 Brandano: Regardless, I have a new problem. pianobar isn't doing its normal action. It normally asks for your username (your Pandora email) and password. I put those in and it says "Error: Protocol incompatible. Please upgrade libpiano."
