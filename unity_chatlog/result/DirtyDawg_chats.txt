 is the new 11.04 due out today? i just checked the website and its still 10.10?
 ahh thx
 its due out later today
 i,m waiting to download it, have to say tho, i am not sure about Unity yet, looks weird
 i just made a 100GB partition in preperation for the new release, i think i may wubi it first tho just to check it out
 on a side note, i wonder why wubi only allows a 30gb max size during setup
 ScottONanski1: today
 WaltherFI: well i have 10.10 proper install on the desktop, putting the new release on my lappy
 ahh
 congratulations
 what do the guys in #ubuntu+1 do when the new release is live? just idle and stay silent for a couple of months?
 ahh
 i heard that X is to be replaced by Wayland, is that right?
 :o
 :(
  i am thinking of using the new Gnome 3
 it means "understand" i think
 jiltdil: have you tried to right click and add it back
 "add to panel"
 menu / main menu
