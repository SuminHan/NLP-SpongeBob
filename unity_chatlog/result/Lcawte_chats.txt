 Dr_Willis: scroll lock and caps lock, yes, I'm running the latest live CD I have (9.10) at the moment
 Dr_Willis: Any ideas then?

 Dr_Willis: seriously? Is there not another way?
 Dr_Willis: There is now way I can back it up, I have the one disk, and I'm not messing with partitions and have LAMP running... is there not a way I can get the upgrader to finish?
 jjlee: not of my stuff or anything on the server, no
 Dr_Willis: I don't have the disk space or the knowledge to play around with partitions, I would backup if I could.
 Dr_Willis: Not everyone has money to spare on the latest gadgets, and Ubuntu One is no where near big enough quota
 jjlee: on my disk? Databases, files and configuration
 Dr_Willis: I have chrooted, now what command do you reckon
 jjlee: I can't, I don't have the storage space or the knowledge of safely playing with partitions, I've already said
 jjlee: do you expect me to go through and grab all the config files, my photos, my databases and everything? I don't have the space to do that
 blackbit: I am planning to additional drives to start backing stuff up when I get some money in, but I can't do that yet
