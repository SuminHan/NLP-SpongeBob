 I need help with my repos - getting 404 errors when performing apt-get update

 cdavis: I'm on 10.10
 cdavis: Here is my output (I posted on askubuntu with no joy) http://askubuntu.com/questions/36115/repo-errors-when-doing-apt-get-update
 ikonia: there are external repos yes, but the maverick/main Sources are getting 404 errors too
 cdavis: I'll give that a go now - thanks
 ikonia: I believe my dns/network is fine... I can do everything else
 cdavis: that seems to have cleared up all but one 404 error
 cdavis: just the nightlies.videoland.org one is 404 now... I'll try removing the repo and re-adding
 cdavis: thanks for the help btw ;)
