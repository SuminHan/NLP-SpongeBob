 hi
 how can I recover the night and day zones worldmap I had in the clock & date applet on previus versions of Ubuntu?
 I miss that map much
 xangua, 'classic'?
 ohsix, yes I'm using Unity
 xangua, but, can I keep Unity?
 how can I "Show Desktop" in Unity? (super + D doesn't work anymore)
 Llj, I mean that I want to minimize all open windows
 KNUBBIG, I prefer a key combination, better if it where the classic super + D
 Omega, that might work tough I'd prefer the key combination
 ok Knio
 ok KNUBBIG
