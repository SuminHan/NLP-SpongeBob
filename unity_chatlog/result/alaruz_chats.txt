 I have an issue with the nm-applet. I have a laptop with 2 users. However only the first user logging in gets to use the nm-applet and choose wireless networks and more. I need to kill the nm-applet with sudo to be able to use it with user nr 2. Is this a known bug or should I report it, if so how?
 ohsix: I can confirm that it is also how it seems to work. (networks added one one user is also stored on the other) how ever since this is a laptop it tends to be moved around. :) e.g. if user 1 logs in and (has control of the applet?) and later switches to user 2, how can that user add a new wifi network without first killing the applet?
 ohsix: Thats the thing, they are able to do that seperately. But the applet only seems to be "available" for one user at the time. e.g. on the second user the area where the applet is supposed to be is blank on the panel.
 ohsix: Okey perhaps I have misunderstood how the applet really works. I migrated from vista to 10.10 this fall on my laptop, but even after natty-upgrade yesterday this issue is still present for me. I had the same user setup in windows without does issues.
