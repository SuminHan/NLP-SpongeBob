 arand_:  It 's final instruction was "running the installer wizard"
 arand_:  it is the installer for netbeans
 arand_:  what do you think i should do now?
 i am of 11.04 and want 7.0 as it has less bugs and better pgp support
 pgp/php
 arand_: i am of 11.04 and want 7.0 as it has less bugs and better php support
 arand_:  it never proceeds the starting installer wizard
 arand_:  i had just renamed the file to nb.sh

 I found a bug in NATTY.
 atdprhs:  just ask your question
 I found a bug in NATTY.  It is unable to  execute .sh file.
 PythonPup:  have you tried jdk 6 or netbeans 7.0
 PythonPup:  lol, ofcourse yes
 PythonPup:  But it wont even install
 PythonPup:  jdk 6 or netbeans 7.0
 ohsix:  even netbeans 6.9 is there...
 ohsix:  if you dont use chmod in 11.04, it gives error
 ohsix:  i tried the same package in 10.10 worked fine but in 11.04 it dont
 ohsix:  okazzz
 terminal stucks at "running installation wizard" after some time returm to normal state. And no wizard launches
 ohsix:  7.0 has better intellisense and php support
 atdprhs:  ??
 atdprhs:  ahh i told you that you post question if anybody knows it they will surely answer and i dont use server or manage it
 Samo502:  dear my main question is to resolve this problem and not the software alone
 Samo502:  yeah thanks i do have it btw...:-)
 its awesome for C++
 ahh i use it and its great, i use it for gtk
 but the main problem is still there why netbeans 7.0 does not launch
 do i need some updates or what
 kblin:  are you able to geton to win 7
 kblin:  are you trying to dual boot win 7 & ubuntu
 okay so two HDD??
 kblin:  maybe you could try out easyBCD
 Ultimate_Chaos:  no swearing please
 So what could be the problem that natty does not launch my sh programs
 genii-around:  yes
 genii-around:  i have not made that program, its netbeans 7.0 and jdk 6
 genii-around:  I just downloaded netbeans 7.0 from web and executed it, no wizrd comes up ever
 genii-around:  no sh ./path
 genii-around:  because sudo does not have 7.0 it is for 6.9 only
 Jordan_U:  lol
 genii-around:  thats why i downloaded it and tried to execute, but it works well on 10.10 but not on 11.04
 genii-around:  are you there?
 genii-around:  ahh. its 2:00 pm here
 genii-around:  okay i try that too
 still nothing it is stuck there only
 i think getting back to 10.10 is much better now and wait more more stable release
 So anyone i am searching for a solution from last 2 days
 PythonPup:  coffee could be much better , lol, would try out later, thanks guys
 last point is 11.04 not a stable release?
 Jordan_U:  then why sh file never execute on it
 Jordan_U:  any way to solve the pronlem i am using this file http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html (c++). But it works fine on 10.10
 Jordan_U:  sorry . are you admin or developer of ubuntu.
