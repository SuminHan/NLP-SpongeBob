 i'm downloading 11.04 right now, and i've taken notice that unity is used by default. is it easy to switch back to the regular gnome desktop instead?
 woot, so many answers. thanks guys, but as i've already said, i'm downloading at the moment, so i haven't had a chance to try it out myself yet. just asking so i would know what to expect. thanks again!
 also, my download is going at a snail-like ~25KBps (even though i have a 1.5Mbit connection, so i should have more like ~150KBps) - i assume this is because the servers are overloaded at the moment?
 hey, i've downloaded the 11.04 iso image, and i'm supposed to burn it, but i don't have any empty cd's nearby. i do have dvd's though - can i use a dvd as well?
 spungo: thanks.
 now that yi`zhi has mentioned language inputs - in my win7 i use alt+shift+1 for english, alt+shift+2 for serbian/latin, etc. and i prefer to access them directly like this, rather then cycle through them with a single shortcut. is this possible to do in ubuntu?
 ohsix: yeah, that's what i've been finding as well, hence the question. i realized it's not built-in, but was wondering if there was some hack to make it work like that.
 ohsix: okay, i'll look it up if it's possible. thanks for the heads up, good to know it's possible.
 okay, i've installed 11.04, and everything went smoothly, then i rebooted, got to the login screen, entered my password, and all the controls disappeared - now i only see a purplish background and my mouse cursor and nothing's happening (for about 2 minutes now)
 any ideas?
 how can i force ubuntu to get me back to the login screen (if it's possible)?
 dasy2k1: heh, thanks.
 dasy2k1: only problem - now my mouse doesn't work :s
 the keyboard works, though...
 dasy2k1: hey, after i've logged in again, i'm in unity now, and the mouse started working. thanks again for the quick tip!
