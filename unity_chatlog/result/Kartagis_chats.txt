 is it possible to chroot ssh except root?
 because otherwise I can't log in as root
 Blue1: this is a VPS
 when I edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config to read ChrootDirectory %h and restart ssh, users can't log in. why?
 unity?
 Osmodivs: what is it? apparently I don't have the hardware tu run it
 ask?
 !unity
 Osmodivs: I just upgraded to natty and when I rebooted, I got a message saying I don't have the hardware tu run unity
 bikcmp: uid 0 and gid 127 can't write to that directory
 bikcmp: you may want to ask in #postfix or #ubuntu-server
