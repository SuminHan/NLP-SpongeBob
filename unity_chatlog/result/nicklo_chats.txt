 Is there an explanation as to what the mac version ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64+mac.iso is?
 I'd like to try Natty on this MacBook but wondering which iso to download.
 red2kic: Yeah I'd presumed so. I was curious where the info is on what that means
 if I try download direct from ubuntu.com I don't get the mac version
 there is also the alternative mac version
 red2kic: where did you get that info?
 red2kic: excellent, thanks!
