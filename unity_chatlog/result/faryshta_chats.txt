 Hello. I can't read original DVD's. Looks like its a region issue. How can I fix it?
 KM0201, yes, I can read pirates and downloaded dvd's. I can't read original DVD's region 4.
 soreau, KM0201, I have libdvdread4 and libdvdcss installed.
 KM0201, I remember using an illegal opensource lib in my old installation. Do you know any?
 KM0201, its only illegal in US. Not in my country m√©xico.
 It was done by DVD-Jon.

 red2kic, aria2 is a program or a command?
 red2kic, will try it.
 red2kic, wget -c doesn't work. Restart the download completely.

 Is there any good tutorial for aircrack?
 llutz, where to find this networkmanager option?
  #aircrack-ng is dead. Does anyone knows where else to find help about aircrack or a good tutorial about it?
 shcherbak, but is very outdated http://madwifi-project.org/wiki/Compatibility?action=diff&version=5 the compatibilily list was written 2 years ago.
 LAcan, did you managed to do it? I am interested in your problem too.

 bison, there is only one thing coming to mind all this time long.
 bison, use the liveCD and check if your files are still there.
 bison, then try to make a back up on them. Re install the all system, try to use /home in a separate partition.
 bison, if you wanna try my idea I can help you step by step.
 bison, do you have an external hard drive or something to create a back up?
 bison, all gone. Let me find if there is a script to save the programs you have installed and reinstall them again.
 bison, if you put /home on a separate folder then settings are restored after reinstalls.
 bison, that is the only think **I** can think maybe there is another way to fix this.
 bison, I don't know. I can't think on any other way.
 bison, try www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs its a very active comunity.
 bison, ask on reddit, they might help you on finding if xorg is the problem.
 bison, does grub start? Can you access your system on shell mode? If those answers are yes then the problem is in xorg.
 bison, can you access grub?
 reboot your computer, after the bios loads push F8 (or one of those)
 bison,
 bison, then you should see a list of boot options.
 bison, then you must choose the option to load on shell.
 bison, its probably the second option.
 bison, yes, then you must see a ton of commands, after a while will ask you to log in.
 Well but we at least now know where is the problem.
 bison, I am not knowledged at xorg so I can't help you any further :(
 bison, I seriously recommend reddit for that. Here people seem very unattentive.
 uberfrau, I don't have flash installed I prefer deturl and add ons to download the youtube videos. Maybe you can give it a try.
 uberfrau, not actually :) you won't miss it after a while.
 uberfrau, it killed your entire system sound or the flash sound?
 How safe it is to install my root folder / on a SD card?
 uberfrau, then the problem isn't in flash, its in your system settings.
 celthunder, I doubt he can paste bin something from shell.
 celthunder, I just found that funny not trying to be offensive at all.
 van7hu, W7 is a cheater on booting matters. It loads the graphic enviroments first.
 sachin, if you installed thunderbird then you should be able to see it on the menu on the "network" submenu.
 sachin, hail! I mean you are welcome.
