 Hello all. Recent ubuntu user - a beginner here. I messed up installing Ubuntu on dell 610m laptop. The vista it came with it is gone and my wife wants it back with vista on it. Could somebody please help? I have the reinstallation DVD from Dell available...Thanks in advance
 A_J: Could you please help me on how to get the partition manager onto the machine with ubuntu?
 A_J: Yes.
 I considered wiping the drive clean but did not know how to get it in ? as a package in itself ? via usb? Thanks again.
 TheHackOps - okay...I will look for gpart.
 A_J: I am getting to a mirror site and am on a slow connection...so bear with me and thanks for the help. Thanks HackOps too.
 A_J: Thank you. WIll do so and report back in about an hour.
 A_J: I have an old system from the pentium days that I want to rebuild and startup with ubuntu on that again....This messing with my better half's pc was my mistake....live and learn - they said.
 A_J - that was the reasoning I used...just have to dust it off and start afresh looking from drivers and such....but thank you for the encouragement.
 A_J: I had some issue with finding wireless drivers on the Heron...
