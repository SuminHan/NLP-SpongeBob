 Hey all; increment the number of people that are so dissatisfied with Unity as to throw their computer out the window, for me
 Can someone direct me as to finding the Appearance preferences?
 Or any preferences at all, really?
 I miss GNOME so bad it aches. I had to launch pidgin from a terminal
 greylurk: no, it feels like windows 7
 Thank you, arand
 unfortunately, none of those preferences are "Show all of my programs"
 I feel like I'm suffocating.
 Whoever thought this panel to the side with six programs in it was useful was obviously a mac user
 how can I trade unity back for GNOME?
 thanks, dotlegend
 I feel so invaded ;_;
 My God, even the scroll bars are unusable
 How do I get my old scroll bars back?
 You know, the ones that did more than just indicate where I am
 Now the thing died. I'm so angry about this new release, I could kill someone. Or go write an angry blog.
 I can't scroll. I can't see where my cursor is. This release is fucking drowning. Good bye.
 Have the flames died down yet?
 Where can I go to make my voice heard? Or do we have to wait for the BDFL of Ubuntu to decide he hates 11.04, too?
 arand_: That sounds evil and otherwise nefarious. I'll do it!
 arand_: Where does the fact that their beautiful scroll bar idea cost me the ability to quick-scroll with middle mouse button go?
 oCean: To be honest, mostly to rant.
 Unless you can tell me how to revert my scroll bars.
 xangua: Thanks much; I'll give it a look.
 Somelauw: Laptop?
 Somelauw: What make?
 Somelauw: Nah. The brightness keys do not work?
 Somelauw:  Click the power manager, go to preferences, and use the control there. Or, add the brightness applet to panel.
 newb_: What Ubuntu version?
 Somelauw: Did you try the brightness applet?
 newb_: Because everything in 11.04 is broken
 Without exception
 Somelauw: Right click a bare spot on the panel, click "Add to panel"
 newb_: Did you update one, and do a fresh install on the other?
 Somelauw: it's removed
 newb_: That's really odd. Both had the same settings prior to the update?
 newb_: Which update? Also, are you sure there isn't a separate setting in chrome that wasn't just misconfigured? (Don't know why there would be)
 newb_: What .g folders? The ones in ~/?
 nbf: That one dude told them to
 heh
 Monk: Ubuntu has always given me problems with laptop brightness, and 11.04 is broken beyond recognition. I'm not sure anyone here can help, but I won't speak for them
 user82: Most recently, Sony. For some stupid reason, the graphics card controlled brightness. Monk's is a Toshiba.
 Monk: What elemtary OS?
 user82: That's a tasty bit of info; I have a samsung in the mail.
 Monk: That sounds frightening
 Monk: Did it work before you installed Nvidia drivers?
 Monk: Have you tried the frequency scaler?
 Monk: Right click panel->Add to panel, choose Frequency Scale Applet
 nbf: Because you didn't think it could be this bad?
 11.04 breaks XQueryPointer
 Loshki: I'm trying to find any sort of substance to populate such a report with, because if XQueryPointer never worked, we'd be in serious trouble. I need some specific scenario in which it fails
 Thanks; I'll need it
 I don't get it; this program also randomly freezes on quit
 Okay, it seems XQueryPointer is generating a BadValue error, even though the spec doesn't mention its ability to do so.
 This means to me that some Unity-oriented modifications to 11.04 mean XQP is making bad calls itself.
 I've just named 11.04 the Windows ME of Ubuntu! *confetti* *trolololol*
 What has changed about GNOME and Bonobo in 11.04 that would cause my applet to stop working?
 Panel applet, I Mean
 ScottR3: correct
 ScottR3: Sorry, I didn't notice your reply. The applet is one I made myself. You can download it for x64 from its project page here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/quickdrawer/ . It worked perfectly on Lucid, but cannoy spawn more than one instance on Natty.
 cannot*
 When the applet tries to load another instance, I just get a Bonobo gripe, The panel encountered a problem while loading "OAFIID:QuickdrawerApplet"
 How do I get APNG support?
 there doesn't seem to be a libapng package.
