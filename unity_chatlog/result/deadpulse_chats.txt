 Hi, I am having some problems with pulseaudio, sound gets muted every 5 seconds. I tried googling, but couldn't find much.
 brontosaurusrex, gparted
 brokendatapoint, maybe a differente partition for /home as well, in case you want to try something else in the future
 DestroiTe, it gets muted every 3 seconds?
 DestroiTe, did you checked alsamixer to see if they are muted? I have a similar problem, sound gets muted after 3 seconds of playing any sound...
 DestroiTe, I hate pulseaudio. Does that happens only with the front jack?
 nbf, what do you mean broken?
 nbf, like what?
 ahh, I didn't try unity. using lxde, no problems here.
 nbf, except for pulseaudio front jack not working
 wojei, yes, for most of settings and accounts. If you backup /home for example
 wojei, if you already have /home in a different partition, then just choose it to be your new /home
 wojei, with a fresh install, nah. Only if you do it manually, as some app may use different config files, different syntax etc?
 DestroiTe, reporting the bug is the first step.
 DestroiTe, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio/Log
 NictraSavios, not bad
 wojei, what did you have to configure? cp the config files and manually replace them on the new install.
 wojei, thats easy, just cp those config files. its not much at all
 wojei, the group yes. Dont do that to the shadow, you will still need to create  the same user on the new install
 wojei, every user wil need to be reacreate , so yes. Once they are created again, they'll use their old home/user dirs...
 DestroiTe, weird, so thats another bug you are logging with the two previous commands.  I don't know much about pulseaudio, all i know is I don't like it. Sorry and good luck
 if the release sucks because of unity ,then it doesn't suck at all.
 JoseeAntonioR_, maybe you want to have a custom xorg.conf file to manually set the resolution. Or use a monitor settings app to change it.
 JoseeAntonioR_, hum, the only way I see you get that resolution working is to keep tweaking the xorg.conf... read the xorg logs to see the errors and adjust it
 JoseeAntonioR, sudo tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 ocx, apt-get install, aptitude install
 ocx, apt-cdrom add
 Pudabudigada, can you play any sound at all?
 maybe a codec problem?
 Pudabudigada, it looks like a codec problem, what do you use to play music? did you try another app for it?
 ocx, and do you the necessary compiler for it?
 Pudabudigada, and vlc didn't work?
 ocx, do only  "$sudo apt-cdrom add"
 Pudabudigada, if you try mplayer file.mp3 on a terminal whats the output?
 Pudabudigada, yes
 ocx, ok so if the dvd is there it got added to the source list. Try installing whatever you want and if its in the dvd it'll get installed
