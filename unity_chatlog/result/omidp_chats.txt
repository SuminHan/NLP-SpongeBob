 hey guys if i run apt-get upgrade will i do the sames as the upgrade in  system ---> Admistration --> update manager ---> upgrade?
 becuz its more fun in terminal
 then wat should i do?
 @Pythonpup how can i do the same action as update manager in terminal?
 python dats doenst  work it just shows the updates not upgrades im searching thru google
 apt-get dist-upgrade only shows the updates try to run
 @PythonPup the speed thru terminal is much faster than  update manager
