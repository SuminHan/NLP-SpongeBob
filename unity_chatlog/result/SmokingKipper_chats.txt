 test
 I cannot understand why my net is running so slow....taking ages to download even a 1.5meg file
 like 20 minutes
 well I am merely trying to update the cache via the software centre
 thanks, I may have figured out the issue...I plugged in my laptop power....I think ubuntu may have a harsh power managemtn throttle?
 oh, one more question....when I right click on an app in the launcer, it launches the app..I want to get the menu up to remove the app
 my right click seems to do a left click (left click is left click)
