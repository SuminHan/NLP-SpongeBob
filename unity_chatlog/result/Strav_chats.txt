 Hi. I just upgraded my ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04 (arch is amd64, running an amd e350 apu), the grub menu is gone and while ubuntu still starts to boot, at some point, the screen gets no signal and shut itself off (I cannot access the VTs in this state). Any suggestion on which bug/s I'm having here? (don't want to report a duplicate)
 (besides: I tried to reinstall grub from a usb 10.10 install by chrooting into my failed 11.04, and using apt-get and grub-update from there... no luck)
 Anyone?
 I can't believe how much nerd rage a left sided docker can bring.
 anyways... anyone can boot the amd images?
 dasy2k1: you used the amd64 images?
 mordof: ok, well I too upgraded from 10.10 (arch: amd64, e350 apu actually) and grub is gone and the screen gets no signal while the boot sequence is checking out the battery (I'm on a desktop so this too is kinda strange). You read anything about something similar... I'm actually browsing launchpad to find something relevant.
 izinucs: I always make a seperate partition for my /home, and last time I tried the ubuntu beta2 image, it failed on grub install
 I'll boot from usb and see if I first can fix grub
 izinucs: nope, just one ssd
 izinucs: if you're talking about grub, nope it isn't fixed... I'll chroot into my failed 11.04 to see if I can fix anything
 he. I just finished creating a ext4 raid array on ubuntu 11.04, problem is: it does not mount automatically, regardless of my fstab. Anyone can shed some light on this? (in mdadm.conf, I have ARRAY /dev/md0  metadata=1.2 name=strav-nas:0 UUID=somethingsomething.... If I check /dev, I have a md folder where there's a file named strav-nas:0; don't exactly know what I should do about it)
 (I should also add, my array is visible from nautilus, it gets mounted using it's UUID)
 Anyone here with some experience with raid5 on ubuntu >= 10.10
 Hi. I wish to periodically run fsck on my raid5 array to check for bad sectors. My raid is formatted as ext4, would a normal fsck.ext4 do the job for this? (I cannot seem to google a clear documentation about running fsck on a raid array, if anyone can point one out, it'll be much appreciated)
 sipior: thanks
 sipior: I'll just schedule one and see what happens.
 He. I'm currently fighthing against permissions on my samba share, some help about it would be real nice.  On server side, fstab entry for the drive (which I share) is: UUID=my_drive_uuid /media/raid auto defaults 0 3 rw,user,exec,umask=000 ... On the client side, it's mostly ending the same way except I specify that this is a smbfs. Now on the smb.conf, my share is defined with: create mask = 0775, writeable=yes, browseable = yes.
 Note: The user I use to login is in the global write list. Anything I could try to see what's wrong? (just to specify: from the server side I can write on the partition without any problem, on the client's side however, I need to invoke sudo)
 KNUBBIG: as I just wrote: I cannot write on the partition from the client side unless I use sudo.
 KNUBBIG: it's on the second part of my msg, just above your first reply)
 KNUBBIG: I must use sudo for any write operation (I'm testing with touch ./tests, and for this, I need sudo)
 KNUBBIG: I expect it has something to do with my fstab entry, but I can't see what's wrong with it.
 He. I just assembled a small htpc using an asus e35 pro mother board, one with those new amd apu. Now I'm trying to get it to decently play an mp4 video at 1080p and it just choke on it. Now I tried different players (vlc, smplayer), tried different video outputs, tried adjusting my video shared memory, no success... any suggestion on that matter?
 (btw, the system has 2gb of ram)
 Herbs: you mean what is my video card?
 Herbs: those amd apu are an integrated solution between gpu and cpu, it's an AMD E-350 APU code name zacate.
 Herbs: and btw, I'm using the proprietary amd drivers for this.
 Herbs: just found some specs saying that the graphics controller is AMD Radeon HD 6310... if that's of any matter.
 Hi. I'm trying to mount an ext4 raid5 array as a samba share but I cannot seem to be able to get write permissions from the client side (sudo is needed for any write op). In smb.conf, the create mask is 0775, the share is browseable and writeable, the user I use to connect with is in the valid users as well as in the write list and the command I'm using to mount is sudo mount -t smbfs -o username=strav,password=mypassword,umask=000
 //192.168.0.150/share /mnt. I tried chmoding 777 all of the mounted share, no success. Any advice?
