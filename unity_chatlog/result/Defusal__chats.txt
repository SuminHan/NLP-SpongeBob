 hi everyone, does anyone know why i would get escaped chars outputted to my console when i use keys such as the arrow keys or tab, using putty client on windows 7 to ubuntu server, strangely enough, when i use something with curses, such as nano, arrow keys work fine, so it must be something about this ubuntu server installation?
 also, does anyone know how to make ubuntu server display the working directory in console lines, this server installation is only showing $
 thanks stimpie

 eekTheCat: i've ssh'd into many ubuntu boxes before just fine in the past, so im almost sure its something about this server
 eekTheCat: xterm
 eekTheCat, just logged into another ubuntu machine and its also xterm, yet the arrow and tab keys work perfectly
 so it has to be an issue on that specific ubuntu server
 eekTheCat: /lib/terminfo/x/xterm /lib/terminfo/x/xterm-color /lib/terminfo/x/xterm-mono /lib/terminfo/x/xterm-r6 /lib/terminfo/x/xterm-xfree86 /lib/terminfo/x/xterm-256color /lib/terminfo/x/xterm-debian /lib/terminfo/x/xterm-r5 /lib/terminfo/x/xterm-vt220
 eekTheCat: im not exactly sure what im looking for, but it appears to have terminfo
 eekTheCat, wow it really kills to use ssh without being able to tab or use arrow keys :(
 so painful
 eekTheCat: well i dont have emacs installed, in console ctrl-p outputs ^P
 eekTheCat, /bin/sh
 eekTheCat, ah, why would it be like this, and more importantly, what do i need to do to install bash?
 i just got my VPS and im not liking its state at all
 maco: then how do i enable it by default?
 eekTheCat, bash 4.1-2ubuntu3 The GNU Bourne Again SHell
 maco, maybe not the best idea for a VPS, how much bigger we talking?
 maco, its not the default login shell on this server
 im ssh'ing to a VPS, and its using dash
 err
 i was given a default password, which i had to change on first login, then it kicked me out and made me login again
 ever since its been using this shell
 eekTheCat: what is the correct way to change it then?
 eekTheCat, thanks
 :)
 anyone know why ubuntu servers dns would just suddenly break, when the dns servers are still functional?
 hahah
 can anyone tell me how i can "restart" any DNS related services?
 tapoxi: gnome 3 is already out ;)
 howkj1, wont that kill my ssh?
 :(
 im wondering how people mostly deal with their servers dns suddenly dying...
 tapoxi: im not sure, but i dont think the gnome3 package will be called gnome-shell now that its stable
 howkj1, yeah i am... append?
 ah, well yeah i guess, but i kinda need to find out why it would stop working, i cant restart the servers networking whenever the dns dies for no apparent reason...
