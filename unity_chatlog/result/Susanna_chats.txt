 Hi there, updated Ubuntu and now graphical output is dead slow when second monitor is connected
 Switched to gnome 3, no difference. Seems to be a driver issue?!
 Hi lcb, using the intel one
 lcb: well, tried with Unity as well but was the same problem
 lcb: "No proprietary drivers are used on this system"

 Juest: ls -la /dev/disk/by-uuid/
 lcb: Yes
 lcb: well I did reboots already
 lcb: upgrade
 lcb: please don't tell me to reinstall
 lcb: I reckon it is a bloody driver issue and will be solved over time (http://bit.ly/mLhpDN). Why do you think a reinstall will solve the issue
 lcb: The update ran without any issue
 lcb: and everything worked well before
 lcb: Yes, I'll try
