 guys...for some reason all I am seeing in additional drivers of 11.04 is (driver activated, but not currently in use). How can I resolve this?
 ChogyDan: hi mate! (version current)
 ChogyDan: yeah, I'm using the recommended proprietary drivers
 ChogyDan: yeah, but I have no hardware acceleration, which means I cannot use compiz etc
 ChogyDan: sec
 ChogyDan: does not tell me driver...only gfx card
 sorry ChogyDan: Driver=Nvidia

 cablop: where is the checkbox?
 there is no active checkbox in 'Additional Drivers'
 cablop: would appreciate it...thanks
 cablop: Yes, normally this would be the case, but I've downloaded, installed and booted usinf the nvidia drivers, but I am being told they are activated, but not in use!!
 cablop: no you dont!

 Ok, so I can see in Additional Drivers that I'm being told "Activated, but not in use"...can anyone help get these working? I have no unity at the moment
 DasEi: actually, just discovered that the unity plugin with CCSM was not enabled :D
 DasEi: what is Jockey-gui?
 DasEi: ahhh, well it's in there that shows that I have 'activated, but not currently using" the drivers
 DasEi: the drivers ARE activated, but I am being told they are not being used. I've rebooted a numbers of times, but nothing changes
 DasEi: where? link?
 man alive DasEi what's wrong with you? You've posted that 3 times, and I've already told you that the drivers ARE activated
 DasEi: I know!!! The drivers are activated, I've stopped and started gdm, but I'm still being told that the drivers are currently not being used
 Jot: I wont find it with DasEi
 Jot: is this a problem with the drivers, or with Ubuntu?
 Jot: if I found out I'll let you know
