 dFshadow like option boot?
 When you boot your mac, hold down option.. you should see your USB drive there.
 yeah use the Bootcamp Assistant.
 dFshadow quite personally, you'd be better off running it as a VM though
 What sort of Mac do you have?
 and are you using Virtual box over VMware?
 dFshadow if you're not using VMware then there's a problem
 XP runs fine on my Mid 2010 13" MBP
 Ewww
 Thats even worse than VirtualBox
 Try Vmware.
