 Hello, i am having a slight problem.. I am trying to do a 11.04 command line install with fb using the alternate cd, but apparently this option does no longer seem to be available in the F6 menu?
 Are there any parameters I could pass to accomplish the same?
 this multi-iso concept of ubuntu seems quite pointless to me, anyway
 gatral: my main issue atm is no command-line install option seems to be available in the 11.04 alternate cd. I was wondering if i could pass any boot parameter to the installer to accomplish this
 or am I supposed to do a netinstall, which seems a different thing to me :p
 it doesn't seem obvious to me if there is there any way to do a command-line install of Ubuntu 11.04 without doing a netinstall
 as the command-line install option of the 11.04 alternate cd seems to be removed
 smw: no need for DE for me, low memory system
 gatral: thanks a lot :p its quite confusing indeed
 Hm, where are gdm's theming settings stored? In gconf in /var/lib/gdm?
