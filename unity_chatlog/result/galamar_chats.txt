 Hello, I'm having an issue with open windows opening at the very top of the screen and I can't grab the top bar to move the window because its off screen. Also the alt to grab isn't working.
 jo-erlend, I mentioned that alt grab is not working either.
 when does natty come out?
 oh
 when will upgrade manager show it?
 If I downloaded a natty disc before its release date can I use that disc to install, or do I need to redownload?
 starwinn, i want to reinstall because my current install is not a x86_64 version its an i586 so i want to better suit my processor.
 ok so how do i get my current install to recognize that natty is available?
 10.10
 so I should wait to upgrade/
 why is my flash slow? on webpages things blink alot slower than they should.
 bastards
 okay so as for my first issue with the windows being to far up to grab and alt to grab doesnt work either any solutions for that?
 okay its not that my windows are appearing to high its the top bar is missing all together.... No   _  []  X   buttons at all????
 why?
