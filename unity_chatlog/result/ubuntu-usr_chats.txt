 hi all
 my xserver does not work after 11.04 upgrade. It was alternate install from cd
 my problem is i can not use internet in command line because 3g modem
 join #compiz
 i can not resize windows! moreover i haven't any plugin in ccsm to fix that! it seems it should be under uncategorized item but it's does not exists. what now i should do?
