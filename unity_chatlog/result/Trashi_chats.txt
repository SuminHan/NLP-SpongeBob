 hi. i installed thunderbird from the ubuntu software manager. now i want to install an addon but i cant see the menu of thunderbird. does anybody know how to fix that problem and "unhide" the menu?
 Dr_Willis: in the top bar i can only close, minimize, etc... but there isnt a menu
 Dr_Willis: no.. its a "thunderbird-only" problem
 atlef: nothing
 atlef: no ... i only see the shortcut menu (get all mails, write, adresse book, tag, etc)
 atlef: what should i do with the arrow keys?
 atlef: but it doesnt because the main menu of thunderbird didnt appear on thunderbird start
 is there a way to launch a mozilla thunderbird addon manager as stand alone, so without the thunderbird main application?
 scotty^: and how to install a thunderbird extension without access to the extension/addon manager?
 scotty^: the archive manager appears ... i tried to open the xpi file with thunderbird from nautilus, but nothing happens
 scotty^: yes you are right .. think i'll try that ...
 i fixed the thunderbird problem. > for everyone whos interested > if the menu top bar menu does not appear for thunderbird, check the thunderbird-gnome-support and thunderbird-globalmenu package is installed. i just installed thunderbird with help of the ubuntu (11.04) software manager. it installed thunderbird-globalmenu BUT NOT the gnome-support... install that package and kill thunderbird... after that start thunderbird and it works ...
 atlef: thanks for your help and ideas ;)
