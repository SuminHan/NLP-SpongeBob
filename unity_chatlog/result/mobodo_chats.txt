 anyone can point me to a place where I can find what to do with my frozen UI un 11.04?  I can log in, but when I click on anything nothing happens.
 RoDiMuS-X: just upgraded to 11.04
 RoDiMuS-X: Unity.  Classic doesn't load anything - I just get a background image and no menu/icon, so it's useless
 RoDiMuS-X: did that already
 RoDiMuS-X: ok, classic with no effect works
 I guess it's time I upgrade my graphics card :P
 RoDiMuS-X: it says "version current", "activated but not currently in use"
 RoDiMuS-X: version is 270.41.06
