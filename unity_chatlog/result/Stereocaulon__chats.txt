 Incarus6, thanks, it worked. I'm on Natty now.
 Incarus6, have a lovely day :-D
 Antilect, and Ubuntu will always recommend to download the 32 bits edition, kind of conservative, don't you agree?
 medfly, in /media/cdrom0
 medfly, np
 deshymers, a hdd-cloning tool? you can use dd if it's not mounted but that's a bit low-level
 medfly, I'm used to Wine, what are you trying to achieve?
 medfly, just mount the ISO with cdemu
 medfly, well, you can open Wine configuration and mount it specifically as a CDROM drive (try the button "Show Advanced")
 medfly, and...did it work for you?
 medfly, what game are you installing?
 medfly, yes, that's a classic, it does contain DRM, so you might have some trouble with that.
 Guest21274, please tell me what kind of trouble you are running into instead of just dismissing a program please.
 Guest21274, what if you just leave the pasword field empty?
 quibble, I have sound, but I did notice that the default sound level in Natty was quite low, you can change it from the Volume indicator
 isarl, me too
 Jeruvy, try /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log and main.log
 Vessago, why don't you try the #squid channel? 51 logged in right now
 Vessago, just wait a while ,keep yourself logged in
 brb
 krad, whoa, that's ancient
 krad, what kind of processor and how much mem do you have do you have in that box running 9.04?
 muneeb, which GPU do you have?
 muneeb, the fact that Unity does not work, means that you are using GPU drivers which are not optimal for your GPU
 muneeb, I'm also on Classic BTW, but with an nVidia 9600 LT
 muneeb, ah, I switched from Unity back to classic after a first glimpse at Unity.
 DerpNauce, right!
 muneeb, check the answers that oneliner__ will get as they could help you.
 muneeb, please try the following to restore unity: sudo dpg-reconfigure unity
 muneeb, Correction, please try the following to restore unity: sudo dpkg-reconfigure unity
 Crazy1, go ahead and ask your question
 Crazy1, try a tutorial about regular expressions
 muneeb, sudo dpkg-reconfigure <package> works for a lot of packages if you run into troubles with them. That's how I fixed my initially failed upgrade from 10.10. Glad to be able to help you :-)
 Crazy1, try joining #regex
 I just love freenode, they have a channel for almost any OpenSource project
 muneeb, I just learned it from a book teaching me LPIC level 1
 Is there a nice program available to edit the Gnome2 menu? The Main Menu editor slab is quite awkward to operate
 asdf_msc, I meant just upgrading to 11.04
 asdf_msc, I don't play WoW
 Is there a way to get rid of the envelope icon/button in the top-right of the screen, without disabling my network manager view and keyboard chooser?
 ohsix, thanks for the notice, I am getting sick of icon rows being merged into one big happy indicator monster. No critique to you, but to the the Ubuntu design team...
 ohsix, I have already protested during the 10.04 => 10.10 upgrade cycle. It was silently ignored...
 ohsix I have been involved, I am not inflating inflating myself, yet I still find it a rather irritating way to handle these things. Toolbars of any kind should be customizable. Period.
 ohsix, well, it is a rather minor issue after all...Thanks for letting me blow off some steam.
 cached, just switch back to classic mode, just as I dd after seeing Unity for about 1 minute
 cached, log off, insert your User name and Password and select the type of session on the bottom
 cached, welcome back in Gnome2 :-)
 cached, I agree wholly on that
 manOwl, just join #ubuntu-offtopic if you want to rant
 jigynet, Ah, you too, loved Omega-rpg, still know it?
