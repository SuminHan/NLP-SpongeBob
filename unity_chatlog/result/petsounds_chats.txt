 So Unity doesn't support nvidia 7 series? weird cause it works in my laptop and netbook.
 sebsebseb, mine is 7 series so it is old, and yes i have the proprietary driver installed (version 270) i have to use ubuntu classic with no effect bc unity and ubuntu classic freeze my desktop.
 sebsebseb, ahhh cool will try dat, thanks bro
 sebsebseb, oki dokiee, brb
 sebsebseb, ok bro unity works with the experimental driver but the screen contrast and colour are not as crisp if i use the regular nvidia driver. do you know how to fix it? thanks
