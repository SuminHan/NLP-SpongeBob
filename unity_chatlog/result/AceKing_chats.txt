 Can someone post a torrent link for 11.04 32 bit download? The link on the Ubuntu site is not working
 Jrib, ok, thank you for letting me know
 jrib, I bet you wish you had a dollor for everytime you have to say that today! LOL

 Damn! took me 3 minutes to download 11.04! I'm surprised it wasn't slower with all the downloads going on.
 I have a question.. I encrypted my home folder when installing 10.10. If I install 11.04 on a new HDD, and hook up the old HDD through USB, will I be able to access my files in the Home folder of the old drive?
 DamienCassou, that's what I'm figuring. I just have to find a way how to do it
 DamienCassou, I just found a link that says how to do it. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory#Live CD method of opening a encrypted home directory
 Is there anyway to install an indicator to see what programs are open and running?
 usr13, knick, thanks
 usr13, knick, But is there a way to show in the panel which programs are open? I'm really trying to give this a shot before I switch back to Classic Ubuntu
 knick, I'm glad to see I'm not the only one
 knick, I hope they redesign this. It looks like a lot of people aren't happy with this
 knick, I know, it's like they took a step back in a way
 Can someone tell me how to install the Kubuntu desktop on Ubuntu without having to do a reinstall? I know it can be done, I just don't know how
 izinucs, thank you!
 izinucs, Great, I appreciate it. I was trying to get used to this new desktop, but it is terrible
 izinucs, I hate the fact that you don't have an indicator to which programs are running. You have to search on the sidebar which is temperamental
 izinucs, When I run the mouse over it, it appears and disappears before I can click on an item
 izinucs, I will try that. Thanks
 izinucs, I'm curious, can you update a computer running Ubuntu 10.10 to KUbuntu 11.04? The reason I ask is that I have Ubuntu 10.10 on my parents computer, and they will be totally lost with this.
 ScottR3, I thought I read that people were having some problems using the Classic Ubuntu desktop.
 ScottR3, Ok, thanks!
 cousin_mario, Are you talking about 11.04 in general having problems?
 izinucs, Thank you! I never heard of teamviewer, is that a remote desktop program? I do have a logmein account, but unfortunately it doesn't work with Linux
 izinucs, I appreciate all your help today! I learned a lot
 izinucs, one more question.. I'm installing the Kubuntu like you told me in Terminal. Setup is asking if I want to use GDM or KDM, which should I choose?
 vibhav, Thanks!
 izinucs, Ok Thanks again!
 izinucs, At the risk of sounding stupid, what are built in gestures?
 I'm trying to disable "Recent Documents" If I use this command, sudo apt-get remove zeitgeist will it interfere with anything else?

 Is there any way to disable "Recent Documents" in 11.04?
 botcity, thank you
 bocity, sorry for the delay, I was away from my PC for a minute
 botcity, I tried it.. didn't work :(
 jguzikowski, go into appearance and choose a lighter theme
 jguzikowski, the same thing happened to me when I upgraded one of my laptops
 jguzikowski, no problem. I didn't like the new layout, so I logged out and booted in Ubuntu Classic mode
 botcity, Yes, I seen a comment below that said it didn't work for them either.
 botcity, I was almost thinking about unistalling Zeitgeist. I just don't know what repercussions it would have on anything else.
 ActionParsnip, Do you know of anyway to disable the "Recent Documents" in 11.04? I've tried some stuff I tried  on the Internet, and something someone told me in this channel. Neither worked. I figured you may know something.
 ActionParsnip, I have been asking since 4:00 AM. LOL. I know you helped me out a bunch of times and never steered me wrong, so I figured I'd check.
 botcity, Thanks!
 botcity, It's funny, whenever I run rm ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite zeitgeist-daemon --replace in Terminal, it starts to run and freezes. I am going to try the second part (remove zeitgeist) Log out and log back in and see if that works. I'll come back in and let you know
 botcity, That didn't work either. What a pain in the @ss this is!
 botcity, OK
 It ran the command and came back to the prompt
 botcity, It ran the command and came back to the prompt
 botcity, yes
 botcity, I ran that last command. Do I need to re run the first command you gave me?
 botcity, No, still there
 botcity, This morning I had some updates
 botcity, I just realized something. Check this out.. http://paste.ubuntu.com/603433/
 botcity, OK
 botcity, Same thing using sudo
 Jordan_U, I was sure of the command, we just wanted to try to see if it made a difference
 Jordan_U, Thank you for the info
 Jordan_U, I understand. There is a problem that is driving me nuts. I'm trying to disable the Recent Documents
 Jordan_U, What is the command to restart zeitgeist?
 Jordan_U, Thank you
 Jordan_U, I am going to log out and log back in. I will sign back in to let you know
 Jordan_U, I restarted my PC and it's still showing Recent Documents
 Jordan_U, Yes
 Jordan_U, I'm going to try it again.
 Jordan_U, This is what happens when I run that command. You'll see where it freezes up on me. http://paste.ubuntu.com/603443/
 Jordan_U, Yes, it's still shows
 Jordan_U, Ok, I'll come back and let you know. Thank you
 Jordan_U, I'm still seeing recent documents. When I ran the command you gave me in Terminal, it came right back to the prompt. Was I supposed to see it running like the other one that was hanging up?
 Jordan_U, Yes
 Jordan_U, I didn't have to completely restart right?
 Jordan_U, http://paste.ubuntu.com/603445/
 Jordan_U, does it look like something is missing?
 botcity, I am seeing Recent Documents under "Places"
 botcity, Ok, thank you for your help!
