 so where do i go to gripe about usability?
 histo, that a channel? :P
 11.04 looks to be a bigger disappointment than i feared it would be
 who's bright idea was it to make windows maximize at the top of the screen, making it impossible to put windows there?
 histo, have a look on youtube. i'm hardly the only one with issues
 histo, nutsfornatty hope so. i haven't tested ubuntu's implementation of it yet. i presumed it'd work like my win7 experience, which i hated
 maco, thanks. i was wondering about that
 BarbaraBush_, actually, i like a number of things about gnome 3, except that it also does the maximize thing, and has eliminated applet support which i need
 histo, mhm. thx
 anyone know if i'll be able to use the win+a shortcut (compiz function) in unity?
 coldfish, that's your answer for everything ;0
 * ;)
 Spaz_Dynamic, you might have a look at startup disk creator... dunno if it supports multiple though
 nutsfornatty, gimp needs a lot of gui improvements though
 nutsfornatty, like 3 overlapping windows? >.<
 kaatta, there's also the ubuntu forums and askubuntu.com
 can upgrade now if you want
 hfx, cdoktor19 , if you jump the gun and upgrade before the official release time you won't clog the servers as much and suffer said clogging as much...
 cdoktor19, buhman1, forces: sudo do-release-upgrade -d
 cdoktor19, and from there you can upgrade to next one. or you could skip and download iso from ubuntu.com
 so, if i upgrade to natty my desktop icons will be gone, yes?
 ChronicSyncope, classic?
 ChronicSyncope, ah, right. so then if not, how would i get at my desktop icons?
 ChronicSyncope, how would you convert them to something as quick & easy to access as they were before? i've put people on ubuntu who put everything on the desktop...
 ChronicSyncope, does 'classic' use gnome 3?
 i'm used to upgrading like a month before release. this is the first time i actually don't really want to upgrade
 ChronicSyncope, hm, thx
 ChronicSyncope, there's a number of things i'm concerned about losing on upgrade that will basically cripple me
 ohsix, well, from youtube vids there's shortcuts that get stolen away from things i use, like compz scale...
 ohsix, i was also thinking of gnome applets like system monitor being removed but i think that might just be gnome 3
 ohsix, also, desktop icons
 ohsix, though that's more important for others i've put on ubuntu
 ChronicSyncope, yikes. i use compiz heavily
 ohsix, also i use things like nautilus-elementary... not sure if that'll break
 so i tried to run unity on 10.10 and it didn't work too well. couldn't access the searchy thing that seemed to integrate with the desktop and not accept clicks
 ohsix, also, from what i've seen on youtube i don't care for the titlebar loss/integration with panel
 ohsix, but i want to be able to use/like unity... it has potential and will likely become standard... i need to be able to make things work to my liking or adapt things
 ohsix, i dislike when features are removed or break others though
 ohsix, i'm concerned about losing my hard-fought-for efficiency
 ohsix, and lack of annoyances :p
 yikes. good to know you can't safely downgrade from gnome 3...
 Tully_, jdownloader
 greylurk, one day i will rule the mall!
 greylurk, bind the mall?
 greylurk, how about blind? (ring = bling)
 greylurk, :D
 hrm, i installed unity on 10.10 and it installed dependencies, but now on removing it the dependencies aren't being removed along with
 carandraug, aptitude is what i use
 carandraug, can't think what
 anyone know why tab completion takes FOREVER in 10.10?
 carandraug, removing recommends manually doesn't remove any other packages either
 carandraug, gnome-do uses a lot of space, depending on mono & such. synapse is a great lightweight alternative
 carandraug, only downside i've found is lack of pidgin integration so i can't easily bring up chat windows
 carandraug, i remember from when i installed it that everything was automatically installed except for 'unity'
 carandraug, synapse has a fair bit. enough for most things, including zeitgeist which i don't think gnome-do has
 carandraug, interesting. i like gnome do, but iffy about unity... yet anyway
 nmvictor, it's sort of a history log of comp activity so you can quickly access things you've done before. gnome activity journal provides a front end, and it integrates with synapse and has plugins for things like banshee and xchat
 carandraug, one reason i don't want to use unity. it coopts some shortcuts i use
 will_, ugh. get with the times :P
 will_, 0C is freezing. 100C is boiling
 will_, both are same at -40
 will_, ~22C is room temp
 will_, below about 10 it starts feeling cold enough to want to dress warm
 carandraug, if it ain't broke, you haven't fiddled with it enough
 remoford, System > Admin > Software Sources > Download from, Other > Select best server
 remoford, prolly would have saved you some time :p
 ubuntu, you may want to stick with gnome ('classic session') 'till unity is more polished
 zetheroo1, it goes away? yes please
 zetheroo1, actually, i'm not using an applet. it's built into the time & date thing in previous versions
 zetheroo1, built into time & date still?
 zetheroo1, >.< ok, so how?
 honestly, seems like 11.04 is a regression. they should have held back until it was ready
 zetheroo1, ah, i saw that in unity recommends...
 zetheroo1, thanks for tip
 zetheroo1, still have detailed info in tooltip?
 bullgard4, ip bound to eth0 interface
 zetheroo1, don't know what a tooltip is? when you hover mouse over somethign and info box pops up
 zetheroo1, hovering over weather in 10.10 shows things like 'broken clouds, feels like temp, wind speed, sunrise & sunset'
 zetheroo1, so check 11.04 for me
 zetheroo1, mmk
 skramer, tried gok?
 skramer, sorry, wrong nick. other left
 zetheroo1, think phonetically
 zetheroo1, 'cause i don't think i'll like unity
 zetheroo1, i've got everything set up how i like it. i'm nice and efficient and no annoyances. upgrading will break a number of things for me, like shortcuts
 zetheroo1, oh, i will when i upgrade... i'm also waiting for a few days after release at least for the wave of inevitable bug fixes
 zetheroo1, i typically upgrade a month or so before release. first i'm i've not wanted to upgrade
 zetheroo1, but there's some drastic changes being made. will be better in long run, but we're not there yet. so i wait
 zetheroo1, *first time
 histo, 10.10 is better than 10.04... only benefit is LTS if you're sticking with pre 11.04 for a while
 vishal_, servers are being hammered due to release. use  System > Admin > Software Sources > Download from, Other > Select best server
 zetheroo1, well things are always improving... not very often there's a step backwards
 histo, i'm not basing it on version number. i'm basing it on my experience
 histo, admittedly i don't do as much server stuff likely, but still seems better
 khaotik, that's why there's "classic session"
 superproxy, ext4 is good
 asiekierka, dunno much about new release, but logging out and back in should work
 vishal_, if you've downloaded the packages already then server doesn't matter. if not, i don't think you can unless you cancel first
 asiekierka, ctrl+alt+del?
 asiekierka, how about ctrl+alt+l to lock screen? i think there's a logout on there
 asiekierka, hrm? no log out?
 asiekierka, wait, you're on 10.10? if so, run 'gnome-panel --replace'
 asiekierka, then i dunno what shell thingy you're using or what the command is
 asiekierka, virtual terminals?
 asiekierka, so you're using irssi or something?
 asiekierka, heh. fun. well a reboot is better than logging out.. if you don't have anything stopping you, ctrl+alt+del in VT will reboot
 vishal_, if you change server, you don't have to redownload packages that have already downloaded
 vishal_, so  System > Admin > Software Sources > Download from, Other > Select best server
 zachgretzinger, the term is PCB. motherboard is the main board that other boards & stuff connects to
 russell--, what's the quote from?
 C4colo, LTS gets 3yrs of support
 C4colo, version numbers are based on release date, so no
 C4colo, why not use compiz or another WM?
 C4colo, well, the lightest ones typically wouldn't work the best with certain environments
 C4colo, i mean, if you want a lightweight environment you might go with icewm. if you just want the wm to use with a different environment there's ones like openbox fluxbox and blackbox
 C4colo, then avoid compiz. not as lightweight as even metacity
 Kyubey, middle click?
 Kyubey, depress the scroll wheel
 Kyubey, can also be simulated with clicking both mouse buttons
 C4colo, have a look at icewm and fluxbox/blackbox and see which you prefer
 Kyubey, then what are you asking? lol
 Kyubey, oh
 Kyubey, i think it's 2 or 3... whichever right click is... it's the other
 Kyubey, test it? lol
 Kyubey, only 2 options
 Kyubey, 2
 Kyubey, win+middle = zoom box in enhanced zoom. it's 3
 Kyubey, woops, contradicted myself
 Kyubey, button2 = middle
 pcgenius, what version?
 pcgenius, of ubuntu
 pcgenius, ah. not familiar with it, but there's an app called startup manager you can use to configure delay and such
 pcgenius, package: startupmanager
 asiekierka, could wait a day for possible bugfixes and do a dist-upgrade from VT
 asiekierka, 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
 asiekierka, linux has nothing on windows :p
 pcgenius, did the app not work?
 pcgenius, package: startupmanager
 pcgenius, lets you configure things like delay
 pcgenius, tap esc while booting. it should prevent it from going past the menu
 pcgenius, once you get it working you may want to add a delay for future
 philipballew, the apt-get upgrade in there is wasteful
 philipballew, that should work. but you didn't state the problem
 philipballew, try with the update manager
 zachgretzinger, apostrophes aren't used for plurals
 philipballew, actually, someone said upgrading is borked right now. should try later
 zachgretzinger, way to make assumptions. i don't know if you know better or care or not. for all i know english isn't your first language and you'd appreciate the correction
 zachgretzinger, care less the more languages you learn? :p
 deneb, wouldn't recommend it
 deneb, if it doesn't work, you can't safely downgrade
 zachgretzinger, spelling and grammar are important. misuse them and they can be misleading
 zachgretzinger, many miscommunications occur without either party being aware..
 deneb, it apparently hasn't worked for some people
 zachgretzinger, don't think i've been hard on  you...
 deneb, what problem?
 zachgretzinger, my grammar was correct, and the lack of caps doesn't make it unclear. and when chatting lack of caps is common and informal
 anyway, gotta run. good luck peopel
 *people
 can anyone help me track down what package to file a bug report on?
 my mouse wheel has limited ability to scroll up. it's a regression
 celthunder, exactly
 celthunder, (see my first comment)
 celthunder, @ minute 18
 KXTwo, big changes. short-term step backwards for long term gain
 celthunder, optical mouse
 celthunder, used to work fine, then about a month ago i think, it started eating up scrolls after a few
 celthunder, haven't checked since i reinstalled 10.10 when it was new... so whatever is default
 celthunder, /etc/X11/xorg.conf exists...
 nzashadow, sudo doesn't belong in your sources.list. it's not a script
 celthunder, don't have /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
 celthunder, isn't synaptics for touch pads?
 celthunder, that's what i said...
 celthunder, just the file. nothing else of similar name
 celthunder, http://paste.ubuntu.com/601133/
 celthunder, ignore the date thing on the right. that's from my terminal prompt
 celthunder, i don't think ubuntu makes much use of xorg.conf anymore
 Cairo|Mac, in what context? ctrl+alt+t in X, or ctrl+alt+f1 etc if not
 spikebike, out of curiosity, what card?
 celthunder, shouldn't need one. worked before, then upgrades, then no worky
 celthunder, but was too busy to file bug report 'til now, and was hoping it'd be fixed
 celthunder, it worked for a long time before without any manual interference from me
 celthunder, even after my wipe and reinstall of 10.10... or was it 10.01
 celthunder, *10.04
 celthunder, so then back to my original question... how do i figure out what package to file a bug report on?
 razz1, can figure out what you were doing at that time from time stamp?
 razz1, could also check browser history and other things for that time
 razz1, ah, so it's showing its original creation time instead
 razz1, check browser download history and such?
 razz1, didn't watch any vids that might have saved the stream? maybe have a vid player crash and leave something behind?
 anyone else getting "No indicators" on gnome panel in 10.10?
