 bazhang, not particularly, I just wanted to have an automated way of watching a movie from the shell...
 hi I'm trying to use the Tor network with firefox (torbutton plugin) and when I switch it on and I attempt to connect to any website I get "the proxy is refusing connections" error. Then when I check Firefox's Connection Settings I see that it changed to manual proxy configuration 127.0.0.1 8118. What am I doing wrong? I have tor and polipo daemons running and I have saved the polipo rc file into my home folder.
