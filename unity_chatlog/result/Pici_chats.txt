 euclid: Yes, really.
 [Dmitry]1: #ubuntu-motu and #ubuntu-packaging, also see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide
 dr0id: And you're asking for support in #ubuntu?
 avij: there is no separate netbook release. I'll see about getting that link fixed though.
 avij: Sure. Thanks for letting us know.
 DexterLB: fglrx does not support that chipset. The open source drivers should work fine. (they do on my x1400)
 DexterLB: Yes.  I wouldn't expect to be able to play games on it, but compiz works fine.
 DexterLB: Can you check your xorg log to see what driver you are using?
 Roasted_: You really should log a bug.
 marel: Have you checked pycharm's support?
 usr13: Its a commercial application
 Fasa: Perhaps if you explained what those were we could help you.
 ashmew2: The latter.
 coolaj86: Looks fine here.  Feel free submit a bug at http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website/ though
 coolaj86: I'm using Chrome right now.
 Salt: There is no NBR anymore.
 Salt: I've reported a bug with the link being on the alternate page already.
 qchn: This is a support channel. Please stay on topic.
 TheNuts: Its a release day, if you can't connect, try another mirror.
 !google | sanaki_

 karlo: Yes.
 karlo: But not if it starts installing them.
 !floodbot | nandinux
 srsbiz: Yes. If you're running 10.04, you'll need to upgrade to 10.10 first, then to 11.04
 rcmaehl: or send notices.
 rcmaehl: I've already filed a bug against the website for that. There is no netbook edition anymore.
 ublunt: #ubuntu-server might be a better place to ask, #ubuntu is rather busy today due to the release.
 giulia: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/natty/release/MD5SUMS
 LAcan_: No, We have less busy channels for that,
 LAcan_: Because he said it was an offtopic question.
 MarkSS: That is all gone with unity. If you don't like the new interface, you can log off, and pick Classic Gnome (or is it classic ubuntu) from your login menu.
 MarkSS: Thats not necessary here.
 MarkSS: Did you listen to what I just told you? You can use the old desktop interface if you'd like.
 MarkSS: Then stop complaining.
 cybrhuman: Yes.
 !Lamp > romeo0
 ryankask: Yes. It doesnt reach end of life until april 2012.
 macrossm: Feel free to pick classic gnome from GDM if you want to use that.
 bikcmp: not unusual for a release day.
 bikcmp: 11.04 was relased today. Or yesterday depending on your timezone
 conical: Wow, that is easy.
 hiexpo: howdy
 conical: I find it useful if I need to use ssh -x to have it open a terminal (gnome-terminal maybe) first, and then run any other application I need from there.
 WhiteD: #kubuntu :)
 feisar: They're in the topic of this channel.
 feisar: What ntp changes were you expecting?
 Incarus6: Thats not needed.
 feisar:
 feisar: That is a very good question.  Hm...
 LjL: Ah.
 LjL: Yeah, still here in natty server.
 mvip: no.
 mvip: LTSes are released every 2 years.
 pumeust: Once you save and exit that, the changes are saved.
 pumeust: You should see a message after you exit: 'crontab: installing new crontab',  then its done.
 pumeust: you need to save without your editor though.  It'll save to a temp file and automagically install the crontab as you exit.
 pumeust: Thats not what I said.  crontab -e, make changes. Save, exit.
 chewyboy000: There is nothing wrong with the one on Ubuntu.com
 proto: Exact error messages would be very helpful for us to help you figure out how to fix this.
 chewyboy000: Why do you say that?
 proto: 'something about...' isn't an extact error message.

 roeland: You may want to ask at #linode at oftc as well, they might have a more linode specific solution to getting to a console.
 roeland: Oh, I see you're there already, nevermind.
 Thriky: I always upgrade via ssh.  As long as it doesn't die during the install part, you should be fine.
 DeadmanIncJS: Just tech support. General chat in #ubuntu-offtopic
 Vhozard: Yes.
 evilsushi: No. 12.04 will be the next LTS
 dennda: I find unity to be not compatible with the way I work. You can still choose Classic Ubuntu from GDM.
 vibhav: hi
 dennda: Good luck then :)

 Ahmuck: You can choose Ubuntu Classic from GDM, removing unity itself may be a bit messy.
 raven_: If you're looking at Software Center, thats where it gets its application screenshots from.
 Artarian: Feel free to pick Classic Ubuntu from the login screen.
 zepherin: Feel free to pick Classic Ubuntu from the login screen.
 comeon: There are a number of opencv packages in the repositories, is there a reason you have that you need to compile your own?
 purvesh, lcb: There is not 11.04 netbook edition anymore anyway. They have been consolidated into one version.
 remoteCTRL2: Mine work fine.
 dasfefg: Pick Classic ubuntu from the login screen.
 remoteCTRL2: I had ccsm installed, made my changes from there. /shrug
 purvesh: No. It will require a complete reinstall.

 Moopz: No. You must go through intermediary versions. The only time this isn't the case is when you are upgrading from one LTS release to the next, and 11.04 is not an LTS.
 Clearly.
 Azelphur: Its not from staff. Please ignore it.

 Toph: I really don't have much Unity knowledge, your best bet would be to ask the channel.

 tyreza: I personally don't understand what you are asking.
 tyreza: This should show your disk serial numbers: sudo lshw -C disk
 tyreza: Much clearer, I just had to test that command on a computer that wasn't virtualized.
 tyreza: Unless you want to ssh into each computer, or use some sort of multi-ssh tool, there isn't a remote way of getting that information.
 tyreza: snmp is less likely to be installed and configured than ssh.
 tyreza: snmpd would need to be running on all the computers you want to query.
 maxagaz: Please mind your language.
 tyreza: Actually using it is not something I remember off the top of my head.  You'll need to do some research yourself in order to determine what MIBs you need to query.
