 Hello. I've made it far coming here. My journey has been long. I am new to Ubuntu, as you might understand. Now, I am wondering what I need to do in order to update my Alpha 11.04 to the full version - any clues?
 maco: Update manager?
 TheRedOctober: Thanks
 maco: the red october: Is there any way to confirm my version?
 It's really hard to keep up with the chatting here...
 maco: / theredoctober: What does that LSB-abbreviation mean? I know LTS is Long Term Support... ?
 maco: Confused, but thanks. :) You're really quick at answering!
 Is the slow flash-response and heavy chewing a global problem, or am I one of the few?
 maco: True. But when run on Windows 7 it's flawless, which sucks. I'm looking for reasons not to migrate back :-P I want to get hooked in this !
 Hello everybody! I'm new to Ubuntu, therefor I ask this rookie-question: I have just installed VirtualBox and I want to edit my icon for my Windows7-shortcut to my *.vdi-file. Where are the application-based icons stored?
 wm_eddie: Yes, I have done that. Now I just need to find the path to where Virtual Box stores its icons.
 wm_eddie: The shortcut had an icon earlier, but it got removed, somehow.
 Is there a way to search the entire filesystem (root) for a specific file name?
 klingan, locate
 escott: What?  > "klingan, locate"
 escott: Thanks!
 escott: Odd question - is there a way in here to simplify the quoting of others name - So that I don't manually have to enter "e s c o t t" everytime I want to focus you?
 ubottu, LjL! Thanks!
