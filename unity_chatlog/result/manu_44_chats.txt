 Hello, could someone let me know where I can manage the FTP default handler on Natt Narwhal please ?
 is there a special channel concerning Natty Narwhal issues ?
 aight
 Firefox has been set as default FTP handler
 I just would likee Nautilus instead
 anyone able to help me ?
 yep
 KM0201 : I did that already
 ActionParsnip : browsed this page already, without success, the ftp key doesn't appear and when i manually add it, it doesn't even work
 KM0201 : and Firefox is the default FTP handler
 can't manage to get Nautilus back instead
 ActionParsnip : no it does not
 the gnome ftp handler rule seems to have moved somewhere, but I can't figure out where
 ok
 yup
