 Is it just me, or Unity doesn't appear when I boot up from a USB?
 hm. I tried it on two computers and both didn't show Unity
 I tried logging out and I didn't see Unity as a choice...
 yes, just downloaded it couple of hours ago
 I even made sure of it, I checked the software version while running the OS itself
 uh huh i see
 oh, both the computers I tried it on had no internet
 possibly the drivers arent installed properly
 I saw :D thanks guys :D
 oh btw, i forgot to check but, what version of LibreOffice comes with Ubuntu 11.04?
 hm, thanks :D @PaulW2U
