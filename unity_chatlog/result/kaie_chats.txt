 hello. I use harddisk encryption, get a prompt for the disk password during boot, works fine. in addition, I use an external usb drive, also encrypted, same password. currently, I must manually unlock the external driver after boot. I wish ubuntu could use the primary-encrypted-password on boot to unlock attached usb drives, too. any ideas how to do that?
 sometimes it helps to asks questions on irc, it's inspiring for coming up with good search engine questions. found http://www.howtoforge.com/automatically-unlock-luks-encrypted-drives-with-a-keyfile - might be able to solve my scenario
 I wonder if /etc/fstab entries can be made optional. if device is present on boot, then mount it. if not, skip it (proceed boot)
 I have an internal disk, and an external backup disk (cloned with dd). I must restore one lvm logical volume. When having both disks connected, lvm says, it detects a duplicate, only allows one of them to be active. Is there a trick to rename one of them, so I can have both volume groups / logical volumes active at the same time?
 (for some reason, after a machine went to sleep yesterday, when it woke up again, the contents of the / partition were corrupted afterwards, just fyi)
 Herbs, yes. a large initial portion of the disk now contains garbage data. no repair possible. I need to restore my backup
 how can I open a backup lvm volume group at the same time as the original one?
 I really can't believe that. netbook with 10.10. it worked fine for a long time. yesterday it went to sleep. I woke it up, it came up, then it crashed. after reboot, I find that then contents of two partitions are totally corrupted. fsck.ext4 even says there is no ext4 filesystem on them
 bibleboy, my data partitions are gone
 bibleboy, I know how to start from scratch, but I wonder if that is a known problem. I can't believe going to sleep and wakeup can delete all my partitions
