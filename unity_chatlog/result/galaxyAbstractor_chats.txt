 Hey
 Anyone know if it's possible to recover data from a harddrive with a broken NTFS partition from a ubuntu liveCD? My friend accidentally plugged out the power from his sisters computer as windows was doing a service pack update...
 Well, he says that it tells him to format the harddrives to use them. Know any tools or it?
