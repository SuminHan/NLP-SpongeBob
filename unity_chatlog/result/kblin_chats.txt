 hi folks
 I've recently switched my ubuntu system to a new hdd, leaving my win7 install on the old hdd. for some reason the grub2 config misdetects which partition the win7 system is installed on, any idea on how the os prober script does the detection?
 Jordan_U: firstly it doesn't boot, secondly, win7 is on the second partition of the drive and the os prober sets root to hd(1,1), and last but not least it sets the UUID of the first partition
 Samo502: I know it's on /dev/sdb2
 I can only boot win7 if I boot from the second hard drive
 Jordan_U: sure, let me reconnect the ubuntu disk that I unplugged to boot win7 and look at what win7 thinks it's world should look like
 Samo502: grub2 is at version 1.9something
 Ubuntu_user: yes, but keeping each system on it's own hdd
 Ubuntu_user: and not futzing with the windows drive's hdd
 Jordan_U: http://kblin.org/code/RESULTS.txt is the result of the  boot checker script
 Jordan_U: ah, spot on, thanks a bunch
 Jordan_U: that fixed it :)
