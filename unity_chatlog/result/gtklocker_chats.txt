 hello, I need some help with ubuntu; I try to install it on a desktop via CD and every version of it I've tried installs some things and then says "Please insert the disk labeled Karmic Koala blabla"; whatever I press nothing happens - any idea?
 LAcan: burning the isos but I've even tried with some shipped 6.06 that still didn't work
 LAcan: TDK CD-Rs or DVD-RWs
 LAcan: the isos from ubuntu.com
 LAcan: I have tried with 11.04, 10.04, 10.10, same shit
 LAcan: I have tried with the desktop and alternative versions, all same shit
 LAcan: and while I could make a custom installation with say Arch Linux I don't know if it's possible with ubuntu
