 does xargs work with bash functions?  I'm trying send the output of xargs to a function, but it's not working
 arand⍈ sorry, rsibreak made me take a break: http://pastie.org/1847785
 arand⍈ that's an example, though what xargs is doing doesn't matter too much, it's the fact that it's not recognizing the function
 arand⍈ I'd guess it's because xargs uses a separate shell?

 gah

 arand⍈ got a better way I can read lines from a file and run that function per line?
 !patience | Kevin`
 arand⍈ it is, I'm sure of that
 arand⍈ that function is just a base for a bunch of other commands, it works fine
 arand⍈ I suppose, I was trying to avoid cat'ing the file :)
 arand⍈ yep, I know ;) thanks
 arand⍈ hmm.. if I $(cat $SPATH/motd) it runs on every word of the file, but if I quote it "$(cat $SPATH/motd)" it only runs on the first line
 Dr_Willis⍈ hmm.. I just want to pass this function every line of this file as an argument
 arand⍈ thanks for the help
 Jordan_U⍈  http://pastie.org/1847865 is the relevant parts of the script
 mastertogo⍈ should be able to set it in ccsm
 Jordan_U⍈ it doesn't send the command to screen otherwise
 Jordan_U⍈ that's line is mostly pulled from an existing, well established script
 Jordan_U⍈ I didn't ask for help with the part that already works ;)
 Jordan_U⍈ thanks, it's modified to this now: http://pastie.org/1847910 and it works perfectly
 Jordan_U⍈ I haven't used read much, so I always trip up on it. that, and I hardly use <
 I'm trying to turn a list that separated by newlines into a a comma delimited list, sed 'N;s/\n/, /g' doesn't seem to be working right
