 Hello everone
 I am thinking about putting ubuntu 11.04 on my alienware m11x r2
 but I have a question
 My laptop has optimus graphics switching technology
 is there any way I can disable one of the cards or something since linux doesn't support optimus yet?
 Can I disable any of the video cards though?
 its not in my bios
 it's managed by software
 its an nvidia card
 vivid: I just dont want my 335gt running 247 and heating up my system
 but it will use the 335gt by default? will it never use the Intel HD graphics?
 ok I guess Ill give it a shot then
 vivid have you tried gaming with wine at all?
 I see
 Well I will give it a shot then
 you've been most informative thank you
 bbl
