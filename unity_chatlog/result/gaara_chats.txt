 cdbs, the screen is dead dark
 cdbs, well i dont have a dedicated graphics card...but its an integrated intel onboard gfx card
 cdbs, so i dont know if its a gpu issue, but i know it boots successfully into natty, but screen is dead dark! backlighting does not work
 cdbs, im guessing this is a common issue, unsolved though, because going thru the various forums did not help either
 fresh install
 cdbs, fresh install
 Polah, 20 minutes
 no
 cdbs, no, i had to install it using nomodeset
 cdbs, nomodeset works, but as you can quite understand, it loads into a lame gnome ui, without any graphics driver, with sick resolutions
 mustafa, i have the same issue, cdbs suggested something to me just now
 cdbs, its enough if i set nomodeset at the grub screen right? for now atleast
 cdbs, awright, thanks am gonna try it and get back to you if it doesnt work :) if it does, pleaase tell me how i can thank you :)
 cdbs, it dint work
 cdbs, :(
 cdbs, i waited for sooo long to get natty, and now it acts up like this, i set it on livecd by pressing f6, and then selected the nomodeset option
 cdbs, its impossible that im the only one having this problem
 cdbs, gnome
