 Hi, peeps. For some reason Bluetooth won't turn on. The menu applet says it's on but when I go into the Bluetooth prefPane I see a but button that says "Turn Bluetooth on." I click that, and the button greys ... and nothing happens.
 s/but button/button
 Kron, yes.
 Is there a CLI command I can use --verbose in order to see the output of what happens when I attempt to enable Bluetooth?
 Kron, wireless keyboards all the way!
 ... radioing to a bluetooth card, hooked into an iMac, hooked into an HDTV!
 Kron, Range is fine from couch distance here
 Kron, it works when I boot into OS X (not a fanboy). I'm using Refit to dual boot.
 Kron, nothing bluetooth-related.
 Kron, browsing
 Kron, sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart worked! thanks!
