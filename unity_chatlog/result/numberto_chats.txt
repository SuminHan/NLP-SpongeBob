 histo:  I really don't know what to do.  I watched the video of new 11.04 and wanted to try it. I really love how it  look but most functions does not work. I wander if there something which didn't install correctly, just don't know how to find out
 My Unity search field does not work. When I type something I just does not find any file nor does it finds any app
 Plus I cannot start launcher by using Alt+F2
