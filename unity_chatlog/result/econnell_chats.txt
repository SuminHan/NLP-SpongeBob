 qin: because i just deleted it
 qin: the less support i provide to ubuntu myself, the more they'll take on their own responsibility... just like every other distro
 hahaha
 x3464: you see why this is so frustrating?
 x3464: this is why i think not distributing a deb and not running a PPA will force their hand...  especially when they find out there's new features they can't use
 "oh... you use ubuntu?  yeah... me too... the software is developed on ubuntu and it works perfectly.... but no you can't use it because ubuntu bureaucracy means you have to compile it yourself.  or.... well... go complain in #ubuntu i guess"
 histo: i don't care what the reasons for your packaging bureaucracy are...  i write software... not packing stuff for operating system s
 histo: we've been in arch and gentoo for like 1.5 years
 maco: hah.... did that about a year and a half ago
 1.0.0 was released on dec 2009, correct
 was in repos on arch and gentoo within weks
 *weeks
 histo: yes... i understand that it's not as fast... but seriously... a year?  seriously?
 it is in aur
 and there is a maintainer
 when i released 1.2.2 two days ago, aur was updated within 3 hours
 sure... but it's available without my having to do anything... now i've stopped making debs... it'll be someone elses problem... gentoo on the other hand is official
 histo: no... i've deleted my ppa because i don't want to maintain it and since i've provided debs, no one else has really cared
 now that i'm not providing those, you're going to get complaints
 histo: yeah... that's what it is...
 ubuntu users are the majority of our userbase
 are you serious?  do you even know what this app is and why ubuntu would be the primary userbase?
 maco: there's been a needs packaging bug for over a year
 hell... look at our forums... we get messages like this constantly: I am giving Ubuntu 10.10 a test run on my main gaming rig (loving it so far ^.^) and i recently found Mangler which solved my biggest issue of not having a native ventrilo client for linux. I was astonished when i found out that there is a built-in applet for my Logitech G15 keyboard!
 i dont' care how the distro works
 maco: wtf... seriously?  do you want to take a second to amend that comment before i respond?
 do you think i make any money from this?  do you think i have some personal gain to make?
 i've got projects way more important than this retarded project...  my fame for this crap will never be important
 sorry
 i just want someone to package it so i don't have to spend an entire weekend building packages for debian based systems... that's all
 histo: ya know... a good portion of my users are blind... and they use an ubuntu deriviative called vinux, which is a derivative of ubuntu for blind users.   We have worked with them extensively within our app to make sure they had accessibility.  All the while, we were able to maintain casual conversation and even *heaven forbid* make jokes about blindness...  do you really take yourself that serious?
 maco: histo: incidentlally... vinux includes mangler by default.... because it's useful
 vinux is the name of the OS
 http://vinuxproject.org/
 maco: i've name it, linked it, linked revu posts, linked debian bugs...  fine... here: http://www.mangler.org/
 maco: i'm frustrated by debian/ubuntu... i shouldn't take it out on you
 lo0m: it's doable, but it's incredibly difficult
 lo0m: if windows is already on the machine, ubuntu's installer should recommend a resize
 if you want to create a vm from the disk, that's a whole different matter... and the process varies based on your virtualization solution
 lo0m: if it matters.. that's what i did
