 taglass, that's what i told thegoodcushion in #debian
 Starminn, don't hold your breath.  Ubuntu isn't going to use Gnome...
 Starminn, i've personally moved to Debian because of Unity
 amit, i've never heard of either nvidia or nvidia-utils (but i'm not using 11.04)
 silvery, you can only use the Alternative CD for upgrade, NOT LiveCDs
 mello, debian is an option...
 thegoodcushion, you don't understand linux.  Choice is a good thing.
 mello, good thing there are lots of options out there ;)  see above ^^
 red2kic, that's way too complicated ;)
 red2kic, i'm just joking
 linuxuz3r, no 10.04is LTS
 related to Rehan's question above, it is possible to use Nvidia Proprietary drivers in 11.04?
 Magnusson, cd -
 spikebike, i didn't think it was possible to use proprietary Nvidia with 11.04
 ManOfTheTuxWorld, you might want to ask in #vbox, when I tried 11.04 in VBox guest additions didn't work either.  Good luck.
 lampliter, faster in most areas, supports more ram
 lampliter, little has changed with 64bits in the last year...
 vibhav, -d in update-manager if for "development" ie. alpha/beta -- Natty is now stable
 MohammadAG, dist-upgrade does NOT update to a new version
 MohammadAG, sorry that is correct then!
 nabi1, you need the alternate cd, NOT the LiveCD - don't ask me how though
 Artarian, reinstall...
 Artarian, as in - fresh reinstall, rollback not supported
 Flynsarmy, i don't think any Nvidia proprietary drivers will work on 11.04... I've asked in the channel, and don't believe the one person who said they have it working (i could certainly be wrong)
 Flynsarmy, in 11.04?
 Flynsarmy, interesting...
 Flynsarmy, Nvidia said they weren't interested in using the replacement of Xorg... forgot what it's called.
 Nabi, i don't think the DVD is an alternate, i think that's a Live, thus can't do upgrades
 html_inprogress, "hostname" in a terminal will show you
 Flynsarmy, thanks.
 miles__, expect all mirrors to be busy for the next couple of days
 jaymeskeller, see !grub2 but you probably want /etc/default/grub
 Shaggy2, "sudo service gdm stop" perhaps
 !register > Avt_
 !natty > Vustom
 Avt_, you need to register with Freenode, see the !register factoid (i already tried to send it to you)
 dxdemetriou, "sudo nvidia-xconfig" would generate one (at least pre-11.04)
 Lesterwood, follow the logout / classic option to get a more familiar UI
 Blue1, very common
 Lesterwood, well forget the bottom panel ;)
 Byan, /etc/X11 - but it's not there by default
 Lesterwood, i don't think you can customize Unity very much.  Good luck.
 Byan, you need to stop GDM then run "sudo X --configure" then copy the generated xorg.conf.FOO (in /root) to the proper location
 Byan, i'm done.  Good luck.
 Byan, sorry yes Xorg
 Byan, no, it is X --configure
 Ubuntu_user, 110.10 - what that's a WAY future version ;)
 Ubuntu_user, /etc/fstab
 Ubuntu_user, drive?  if your the one asking about the windows bootloader BCE (whatever) I have no idea.  Linux doesn't use drive letters.
 beoyndcr, Stryker there are other distros out there
 Maahes, mplayer
 stercor, did you install ssh server?  is it running "ps aux | grep ssh"?
 Viking667, there is an Ubuntu One channel... probably #ubuntuone (but i didn't check)
 !panels | thelorax
 !panels | thelorax
 thelorax, are you using 11.04?
 thelorax, disregard the !panel factoid then!
 thelorax, welcome to unity ;)
 thelorax, i repeat - welcome to unity.  I've stopped using Ubuntu because of Unity myself.  Good luck.
 thelorax, debian / trisquel
 thelorax, have you tried "Classic Mode" from the GDM screen?
 thelorax, GDM = the login screen, select your user name, then at the bottom click Session
 thelorax, glad to help
 alokar, mozilla PPA
 alokar, i couldn't tell you for sure, but i'm sure that would work - i believe there is a stable (vs daily build) PPA though
 alokar, the daily ppa is built each night
 Romance, a question for #ubuntu-offtopic
 OsamaDeadYay, for desktops until 2013 April or so
 OsamaDeadYay, after that?  I guess so?!?!
 Josesordo, i was just looking at http://www.ghacks.net/2010/07/11/run-compiz-with-xfce4/
 Josesordo, ?
 bear_, if u-r-e doesn't have what you're looking for check out w32codec (or w64codec) from Medibuntu
 bear_, u-r-e should cover "most" of it
 Rehan, vga= is deprecated
 Rehan, what version of ubuntu did you find that by default?  it's not directly translated to a 795 pixel resolution BTW.
 Rehan, lol figures.
  _genuser_ i don't think many of the experienced users in this channel would recommend upgrading ubuntu.
 _genuser_, sure, downgrade = fresh install
 wolfreak_99, it's very unlikely that you find a method to install to non-standard location I'm afraid.  Best of luck.
 Buddhacz, unlikely, you'd need to symlink a lot of different folders (libs, bin, etc)
 wolfreak_99, dd will replace EVERYTHING at a low level (proceed with caution), rsync is at least at a file system level, and more common for backups
 IsmAvatar, to find your gfx card "lspci | grep -i vga"
 Jasonn, close any update / synatpic / usc windows
 jwtiyar, you can only use the Alternative CD, and NOT the LiveCD for upgrading
 !alternate | jwtiyar Omega
 xangua, oh, then the !alternate factoid needs updating ;)  thanks good to know.
 Omega, as well as being a text mode installer it's "also" capable of updates
 Newbiehere, AMD64 will work on Intel as well
 Jasonn, XFCE uses close to the same amount of resources as Gnome, lxde (what lubuntu uses) is lightweight in comparison
 Jasonn, you could install lxde on Xubuntu and give it a try, you certainly don't need to reinstall an OS
 beanstalk, by default LTSs will only upgrade to another LTS - sorry I don't know what you have to change to get non-LTS version.  Good luck.
 DasEi, "u-m -d" is saying update to development version
 wasabi, multiarch is a Debian thing isn't it?
 Jasonn, "lspci | grep -i vga"
 pie_, alt+sysrq(usually printscreen)+k
 pie_, /etc/X11/xorg.conf probably
 belak, in /etc/grub.d "sudo chmod -x 20_memtest86+"
