 Just installed 11.04 64bit, fresh, and first boot I tried to install the nvidia drivers from the nvidia site. Now I am stuck without X, and cannot seemingly generate a correct xorg.conf (I believe due to the fact I had to start using a vga monitor with a DVI adapter. I started having issues in 10.10 with this monitor, and no issues in 10.10 with a DVI monitor.) I've tried nvidia-xorgconf, still "no screens found". I need to generate
 could anyone assist me in generating an xorg.conf with my nvidia?
 ohsix: the latest 270*.*.*
 ohsix: So can I remove the nvidia driver and try something else in gui?
 ohsix: Until nvidia drivers are updated?
 ohsix: what via apt-get for the nouveau
 ohsix: just uninstalled it. If I can get back in a gui I'll be more able to do things..
 ohsix: well how can I do this via cli?
 ohsix: Oh duh:( So....which files exactly?
 ohsix: Just copied /var/log/*, will that cover everything?
 How can I add a "custom" resolution to xorg.conf? I need 1280x1024
 iceroot: But the thing is...I am using a vga monitor to my dvi card using an adapter...and it doesn't detect the "default" of 1280x1024...
 iceroot: I need to know what line to add to xorg.conf for that resolution, I've done it before but I cannot remember exactly what it is...
 if I use dd and ff correctly, can I mirror my / to /dev/sdb1 and then install windows on /dev/sda1, edit grub, and then boot from either windows or ubuntu? I guess, I'm asking if "mirroring" the hard disk to another will make it bootable? Note the hard disks are different sizes.
