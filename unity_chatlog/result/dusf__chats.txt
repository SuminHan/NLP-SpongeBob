 hello, on my upgrade and logging in to 11.04 of 20 mintues ago my mouse moves but i cannot click anything, there is a new apple-like dock on the left side of the screen, a ubuntu icon top left, but nothing else in my top panel - when i click the mouse button and or press keys the system doesn't respond - is there a know fix?
 Axlin: for me it happens immediately on logging in, several times, the mouse cursor moves but the system will not respond. i had compiz disabled in 10.10 for WINE, would it still be disabled on upgrading?
 Chuchulain: that's a very Irish name, welcome :)
 Axlin: okay, so I log back in, try alt+f2 and compiz --replace ||| do i need to do something else with unity?
 Axlin: well it's bugging out every boot so far, instantly, i haven't been able to interact with the GUI
 Axlin: won't --replace just reinstall the same problem?
 Axlin: allow me to clarify for you, it is not just one or two panels that are unresponsive, i cannot interact with anything on the desktop, the mouse cursor moves but i cannot even hilight folders sitting on the desktop
 Axlin: tried taking a screenshot etc, no response
 Axlin: yes
 Axlin: after alt-f2ing up a term how do i get back to gnome/x ?
 Axlin: please tell me how to install it, unless i just alt+f2 sudo apt-get install unity-2d?
 Axlin: and the command do get back to gnome, or shut i just do a shutdown now ?
 s/do/to
 *should :)
 Axlin: so type exit? or.. ?
 Axlin: wait, i thought alt-f2 would bring up the fullscreen term
 Axlin: the way it's acting i do not suspect it to respond bring up things in gnome
 ok
 Axlin: thanks. will i bother with compiz --replace or just ctrl-alt-f2 sudo apt-get install unity-2d and ctrl-alt-f7 back?
 Axlin: okay dude, back in 5/10 mins, hopefully from an open source operating system :)
