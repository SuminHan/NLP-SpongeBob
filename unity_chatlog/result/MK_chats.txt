 How's 11.04? :)
 Cool. I'll be torrenting it soon
 I probably won't upgrade just yet but I'll seed the torrent
 I do want to upgrade however as the new kernel fixes a hardware bug for me
 I predict a GNOME 3 Gubuntu derivative around the time of the next release.
 Yeah Ubuntu_user
 same ^
 full install Ubuntu_user, separate partitions using the LiveCD
 Ubuntu_user: nope, works fine. Although, after I installed ubuntu, the final character of all the passwords of user accounts on windows 7 were cut off, *no idea* how that occured.
 Ubuntu_user: I never had it mess with my grub installation.
 Ubuntu_user: yeah :( you can probably fix grub with a liveCD, these guys can help, I am not an expert
 I'm going to use an old harddrive of mine specifically as an Ubuntu repository and seed them when I can
 10.10 is boss, good luck!
 go to System > About ubuntu for information on the version

 That's what everyone has in the back of their head PovAddict: Gubuntu 11.11
 Compiz is the window manager, Unity is the shell, to be more precise.
 Ooh I didn't know what ohsix
 Ubuntu will be Gnome 2 with Unity; the inevitably Gubuntu will be Gnome 3 :P

 Andrey_BTI: what error do you get?
 yeah most likely mickster0. Andrey_BTI, can you connect to it successfully via direct IP?
 Andrey_BTI I actually had a similar issue and it ended up being a bug in nautilus. I'd make sure the workgroup is correct, the permissions on the share are correct, etc.
 Andrey_BTI: if it worked fine, you didn't change any settings and it suddenly stopped working, it may be the nautilus bug I encountered
 because I could use other file managers and it worked fine
 Andrey_BTI : if you want to chat in russian

 Are the earlier releases of Lucid. 10.04 and 10.04.1, available for download anymore or do they only host 10.04.2?
 Are releases like 10.04.1, that have been superseded by 10.04.2, supported, or is only the most recent point release supported?
 !Oneiric
 This may sound strange but does anyone have torrent links for the old, unsupported versions like 4.10 and etc.?
 This may sound strange but does anyone have torrent links for the old, unsupported versions like 4.10 and etc.? They seem to have been removed from the old-releases server, yet ironically the isos have not been. I don't want to hammer the server, I'd rather use the torrent.

 tortoise: need to remove the dash
 no it worked for me tortoise, without the dash. With the dash, 404
 no idea tortoise
 zoidfarb: perhaps removing the ubuntu-desktop metapackage, but I don't know if I can recommend that safely heh
 zoidfarb: still there?
 sorry for the delay zoidfarb, you can check out: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purexfce
 Pascalcmoi: that's what this channel is for :P
 pamela: before X starts?
 or during
 I was just going to suggest xinit
 pamela: one moment
 pamela: copy the xinitrc file in /etc/X11/xinit to ~/.xinitrc, that is the default file it uses if there is none in ~
 then add your line
 Pascalcmoi: did you install it from the software center?
 hm. have you tried running it from a terminal to make sure it is installed correctly?
 Pascalcmoi: run ratpoison --replace
 not sure Pascalcmoi :( I do not use ratpoison
 you'd need to kill your current wm and then run it
 Pascalcmoi: I do not use ratpoison, the wms I use all support replace
 Pascalcmoi: I need to leave, sorry :( hopefully someone else can help you
 Is it save to upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 if I have more than one desktop installed?
 My laptop brightness is stuck on max and I can't change it, probably a similar issue
 Ubuntu uses X Window for its window framework
 They are planning on having Unity use Wayland but that is probably going to be after 11.10
 edbian: I don't think 11.10 will use it
 runlevel 1 is S?
 yes
 Can I resize a partition with the disk utility or do I have to use something like gparted?
 ok thanks
 !12.04
 !onerious
 !oneric
 there. That's not an LTS, ^Phantom^
 no ^Phantom^ it's the other way: alternating non-.10s so far. 6.06, 8.04, 10.04
 so the release after 11.10 will most likely be 12.04 LTS

 hi celthunder
 SerialMDK: you need to specify a partition as /
 SerialMDK: how many operating systems? Do you have windows installed?
 and how many drives
 Is it possible for me to have 2 separate installations of Ubuntu (eg. a 32-bit and a 64-bit) installed but share a list of users and use the same /home partition?
 Yes Jordan_U. I was curious about the process. If I wanted to access the files of a different user in /home on the other installation, I'd have to manually provide the encryption key?
 Jordan_U / cheapie please check my line :)
 Jordan_U: essentially if it is possible to share a user list
 Jordan_U: I know... just forget it :/
 charles: alt+f2, run nautilus, then right click a folder and go to "Open With" and change the default
 charles: that's strange... it's not listed on the bottom of the "Other Application" menu to remember it?
 charles: I am on 10.10 so it may be different
 freeman_: Unity uses gnome
 if I want to remove all config files when I remove a program, I have to use purge, and not the software center?
