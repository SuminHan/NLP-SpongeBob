 I have a sound problem. Sound does not work with any app, except for mplayer I discovered if I use -ao oss, it works
 also, my old test of `cat /bin/ls > /dev/dsp` also produces noise
 alsamixer also works, but again no alsa apps produce audio
 the drivers are clearly working, so what's left to be broken with alsa?
 Kevin147: wiggle the cable?
 Kevin147: oh, duh. Didn't think of that
 Kevin147: play with /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
 how is it possible that Alsa works with OSS emulation, but not by itself?
 any ideas why alsa wouldn't work, but oss emulation does?
 is there a program that can run gnome applets in a regular window?
