 My google-fu is weak tonight... anyone know of a quick way to restore my emerald themes after Maverick to Natty upgrade?  running 'emerald --replace' causes a segfault.  :(
 Hi folks.  I tried asking this yesterday, but lost my connection.  Does anyone know how to get Emerald themes running under Natty?  Whenever I do 'emerald --replace' it segfaults on me.
 arrrghhh: well, I guess so, but the themes are so much better than what I have seen in compiz.  I never realized it was that old.  Are there similar quality themes for compiz/unity then?  All the ones I have seen when I click 'get themes' are *very* basic, no glass transparencies, etc.
 arrrghhh: I guess I should hunt for alternative themes then.  Am I right in assuming that I can use compiz themes under Unity, then?
 arrrghhh: ok, I will see what else I may have missed.  The thin borders on most of these default themes are really hard to grab for resizing, etc.  Thanks for the help! :)
 arrrghhh: yes, and the new scroll box that appears when you get the mouse in *just* the right spot is annoying me also.  Thicker borders would help me there, but there is not enough configurability in the default theme engine.
 Getting the hang of Unity here, but it seems rather sluggish to show the new side bar.  Anyone know of a setting to change the delay of the unity bar to something less?  It takes almost a full second to come up atm.
