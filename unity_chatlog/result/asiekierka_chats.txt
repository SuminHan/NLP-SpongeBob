 Hello
 So I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04
 now my OS is a complete s**tfest
 in GDM everything blinks the menus are not visible
 i got here from irssi actually :/
 NOPE
 don't
 i just ruined my Ubuntu installation using the standard way
 and have no idea how to fix it
 anyone with 11.04 can help :/
 this is really bad =(
 i need to use my computer to move some files now but i really can't
 unless i use cp /*
 or something
 xsinick_laptop in what way
 i use Nvidia
 >:(
 i use Nvidia and the entire Gnome (notifications and desktop) blinks for me on/off
 and the menus aren't visible at all
 carandraug i'll just run ./fixgpu.sh to install the beta drivers i use
 i'll see if it helps
 (my own script)
 brb
 Derrrrp
 this is NOT what i intended
 :[
 the drivers didn't help
 what to do now
 carandraug didn't you know how to fix the nvidia issues?
 oh
 i... am honestly annoyed by this fact and hope a fix is released
 is there a way to get the OSS nvidia drivers into Ubuntu? like, by command line
 rikriktherik: ugh... apt-get install default-jre
 just do it as root
 what was the X configuration command for ubuntu actually?
 i think there was one
 not sure
 maybe i mistook it for another system
 so, what was the x video configuration command in Ubuntu 11.04 (command-line)
 :(
 :|
 Okay, i'm in failsafeX
 GDM booted without blinking
 but i STILL can't see the menu bars
 what's going on!?
 sdegutis 11.04?
 waterman for propiertary driver users yes, especially nVidia
 yes but i still have no idea how to restore the gnome menu bars
 also everything is so square now just as if a theme pack wasnt installed
 this is a horrible upgrade for me
 tanath i don't have access to any menu bars
 and stop gdm/start gdm fails
 oh wait a minute
 nope
 checking ctrl+alt+del
 tanath hibernation, sleep, reboot, turn off
 eiriksvin i like how classic didn't have problems
 i mean
 10.10
 one moment
 ok, i got screen lock there
 but the lock menu doesn't appear
 just its desktop
 i think like
 half of Gnome broke up and i need to reinstall it
 tanath there's a change user option
 i clicked it
 and now i'm at an empty dekstop
 tanath i'm on 11.04
 upgraded from 10.10
 tanath i'm using the tty shells ubuntu gives
 you know, Alt+F1-F4
 i'm considering a reinstall
 but i'm not sure if i'm considering ubuntu :|
 it was fun and easy, sure, but
 tanath i think so, yes
 tanath yep, irssi
 notthe narwoah you expected
 was it
 i'm already in failsafeX
 okay this is not helping
 Looks like any plans of doing stuff today will have to wait
 i'm considering changing distros :/
 tanath I believe 11.04's X installation ended up corrupted for me
 half the things barely installed
 Chaoss so seem I
 I used 10.10
 it worked perfectly
 upgraded and now...
 GDM blinks in normal mode
 no menus visible in failsafeX
 (or normal)
 lock screen is also buggy, buttons are square and look like themeless
 tanath yeah
 what's the command again?
 Chaoss
 if you shout we're going to ignore you even more
 look, a new version of Ubuntu ruined lifes of hundreds of peole
 ZenGuy311 not with the thousands of packets i had installed
