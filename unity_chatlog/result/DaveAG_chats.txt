 We're currently running 10.04 LTS with Evolution 2.28.3 to connect to an Exchange 2003 system via the OWA based exchange connector. I've been unable to find any means of connecting, either MAPI or OWA, to Exchange 2010 which we will be migrating to this summer. I know IMAP will work but am looking for a solution that would get calendaring in as well. Davmail looks possible, but I'd rather not have an extra service to support just to bridge Exchange to
 Halzen: This is for integrated groupware, not just email. I didn't thing Thunderbird had any way of tying into the GAL and calendars does it?
 Halzen: Cheers, that definitely looks worth a try
