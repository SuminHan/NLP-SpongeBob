 gogeta: have you tried kde 4.6
 gogeta: was gonna say if you're unhappy with unity & gnome 3, kde 4.6 is better than gnome 2.32
 everyone seems to have trouble upgrading....i bet if you edited sources.list and did dist-upgrade you'd have a better chance of it working
 because upgrading debian isn't a problem
 ejv: i thought unity had the menu bar at the very top instead of in the app window
 ejv: they made it like a mac where they moved the menu up there
 eiriksvin: i wouldn't install anything from the software center
 eirisksvin: i'm not 100% sure, but i did read where it screws up registering dependencies if you need to remove stuff later
 eiriksvin: i just started using gpodder and it's pretty cool
 haha
 Chaoss: I think ubuntu mounts the drives in /media
 Chaoss: you need to figure out the device names of the other two using "fdisk -l" then mount them with fstab
 itilious: people are in #ubuntu-offtopic complaining right now...it's pretty funny
 amit: you need 3d accelleration for graphics
 amit: it might work if you install proprietary drivers for your video card, because nouveau won't work
 amit: 'apt-get install nvidia nvidia-utils, then reboot'
 amit: classic won't be the same as the old gnome
 amit: I probably don't have the name right then...you need nvidia's proprietary drivers though
 Braiam: who's that
 why, I don't know what I'm talking about half the time
 lgp171188: don't know...I'm not using it
 Kingsy101: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-static-ip/
 Kingsy101: you'll need the netmask and stuff

 teage: i use nmap for that
 amy_: ubuntu server will install pretty fast with a usb stick
