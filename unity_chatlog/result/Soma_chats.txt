 hey... I just got up and had 47 updates, one of them being "libkmediaplayer4", and my updating process stopped with "preparing libkmediaplayer4". it's been like that for about 10 minutes. what do I do?
 I'd like to move the top-bar in unity to the bottom, which is the way I had it before upgrading to 11.04. but I'm not even able to right-click the top bar or drag it or do anything. suggestions?
 wow having an app open in unity is annoying. and I can't even alt-tab into a new tab. I have to minimise my app so I can select another one. since of course there's no task bar either
 :S
 Flynsarmy : not yet :o
 I'd love to love unity, but I can't figure out how anything works.
 it doesn't seem very handy :S
 Anyone figure out how I can make the app launcher in Unity NOT auto-hide?! I'm so sick of having to open it every time I wanna switch applications.
 also, alt-tabbing between programs doesn't work anymore. :S
 how do I customise all the things that unity messed up without asking me? (navbar on top instead of bottom, app launcher set to auto-hide, etc)
 I'm going insane here
 someone please help me, I'm going insane with unity. how do I change that the app-launcher on the left is NOT auto-hide but constantly visible so it doesn't take me ages to switch between apps. also, how do I enable alt-tabbing between apps, and how -- for the love of god -- do I customise the top navbar (the part with the time etc in it)
 lugkhast: but what annoys me deeply is that first I have to navigate the pointer to the top-left, then the launcher pops out, and then I still have to select the app I wanna switch too. I wanna be able to click on it instantly. but thanks, I'm installing ccsm!
 Anyone got any idea how I can add a "view workspace" button to my app launcher in unity? And also, how do I customise the size of the top-bar (with my username, the time, etc in it)
 okay, coz_ , then what about the top nav bar? I'd love to have that at the bottom, and a lot bigger than it is. I'm on 1920x1080 and it's *tiny*
 anyone here know how to deal with performance issues when it comes to flash. with windows, I can easily watch 1080p youtube videos on fullscreen. with youtube, 480 is as high as I can go without it going choppy. and flash games are virtually unplayable.
