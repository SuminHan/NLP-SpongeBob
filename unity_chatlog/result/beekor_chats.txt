 I been reading a bit about app indicators and ppa's and shit.
 hmm.
 it may take a long while, cushion.
 like minutes.
 i get that sometimes printing pdfs.
 yeah.
 if it's flashing, you most likely have something coming to the printer eventually.
 yeah, i have dual monitor issues too.
 Any ideas how to get my monitors to detect themselves in the Monitors program ?
 one issue has been those becoming unknown.  and I'm not sure where they're located.
 hmmm, not sure cushion.  is it usb or parallel ?
 not sure, cushion.  Does it detect as the correct printer model ?
 hmm, not that i know of, cushion.
 well, people only answer questions they know, i'd hope.
