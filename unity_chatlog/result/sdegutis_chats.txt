 im using an irc client.
 hello. i am using some kind of irc client.
 not really, no.
 im writing it, too.
 and im using it.
 just thought id let you know.
 thanks.
 i try.
 its not very good though.
 but thats ok because its mine.
 well, you arent on this side of it.
 on this side its pretty crappy.
 its ui is largely html+css+jquery, even though its a desktop app.
 well, not really.
 it doesnt work on ubuntu though.
 you guys just talk a lot, which helps me look at my client :)
 especially the scrolling and stuff
 usually
 thanks :)
 i like making useless stuff :(
 oh one thing i like about my client: when you send a msg to a channel which yo dont have permissions for (like ##linux whe you arent voiced), it gives your message a strikethrough
 kinda..
 although it doesnt have private messaging yet
 im using an irc client.
