 usr13, i wouldn't really even know where to begin with repairing it
 hi, I just installed ubuntu 10.10 64 bit on an asus ul50vt laptop and went to update the nvidia driver, now when i restart I'm getting it hanging at the "checking battery state" message
 i'm pretty new to linux so i'm not really understanding what to do here
 gogearvibe4g: it's not right now
 sebsebseb: i just clicked on "additional drivers" when i started ubuntu up for the first time and installed it through what popped up there
 sebsebseb: oh okay.  how do I remove it now that i've installed it? lol
 escott: yeah I just tried it and it does the same thing when plugged in
 GeForce G210M
 gogearvibe4g: yeah i just installed it clean a few minutes ago
 hiexpo: i have no idea, a friend just gave me this laptop lol
 escott, okay i'll look
 hiexpo, no i didn't, i'm still just kind of trying to learn my way around linux, this is my first time playing with it so i don't really know too much of what i'm doing
 hiexpo, how do i get there? it hangs everytime i try and start my laptop
 usr13, i just installed ubuntu, and installed that nvidia driver, and now when my laptop starts up it gets to "checking battery state" and hangs there
 usr13, nope, i can't do anything, it just stops at the black screen
 hiexpo, i'll try that
 usr13, that worked to log me in, i don't really know what to do from there though
 usr13, i wasn't getting a specific error, it would just hang when it got to "Checking Battery State" when it was booting
 usr13, i installed it and it started up with no problems, then i went to "additional drivers" and it suggested an nvidia driver, so i installed that and restarted and since i restarted it's been hanging at the battery message
 just says "
 "/etc/X11/xorg.conf"
 usr13, ooh, it went past it and to the login screen now
 usr13, yeah haha, i'm going to restart and make sure it'll go all the way now
 usr13, out of curiosity, what did that actually do?
 usr13, ahh okay.  it started up perfectly, thanks so much!
 usr13, oh okay.  from what's been explained to me i guess i don't really need the proprietary one anyway
 usr13, i wouldn't really even know where to begin with repairing it
