 ok, getting more used to unity, when an app is full screen how to I move it to my other screen?
 also on pidgin I have no scroll bar to scroll down on this thing, or up.
 Dr_Willis: I'm sorry, not another desktop, I have dual screen and want to drag it over to the other screen
 Dr_Willis: as for the scroll bar, right, but in pidgin it just doesn't exist, when I scroll over to where it should be and get the arrows, there aren't any.
 Dr_Willis: thanks.
 Dr_Willis: for the full screen app, I was hoping to get around that, but thanks, also for the pidgin thanks anyway.
 ActionParsnip: for the channel window
 after about a day of using Unity, and breaking it twice, I'm getting more accustomed to it.
 ActionParsnip: yeah, I'm on unity too
 ActionParsnip: when I go over the users, a scroll bar (arrows) pop up, but not so for the channel window.
 ActionParsnip: ahh, found it, on the users list, it is only towards the top, and the channel list only towards the bottom on the left hand side of both they appear.
 ActionParsnip: odd, but they are there, thanks.
 ok, on movie player (totem) the right arrow key used to advance 1min and the left went backwards 10 or 30 seconds, they don't work anymore?????
 no one know of totem?  I can't even drag the slider to go forward or backward on a file, very odd, is that a bug?
 anyone know of a good timer for ubuntu?  I used to use the tea timer on the panel, but well, that no longer exist with unity any timely timer tips??  :)
