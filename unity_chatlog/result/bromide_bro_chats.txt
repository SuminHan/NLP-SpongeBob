 is there some particular reason why this ubuntu installer is telling me i need 4.4 gb of hard disk space when the boot disk is only something like 600mb
 because this is an old asus netbook and it only has 2 gb of hdd
 really... i wonder what the heck they added that makes the new install so huge
 at any rate, i guess i can't install 11.04 on this netbook
 jordan_u:  it must have; i've had more than enough disk space to install ubuntu on this netbook before
 2gb
 the last version on this was probably something like 10.04, but i don't remember exactly... it didn't have this new installer
 i definitely only installed the netbook versions
 it's  a shame they discontinued that line (did they?)
 i'll try netbook edition 10.10, then
 ...can you even download netbook 10.10 from the ubuntu site anymore?  it's not showing up
 the non-netbook versions require too much disk space for my netbook
 and the netbook edition has been discontinued
 since i guess most netbooks these days have more than 2gb hard drive space
 it hasn't got one
 this is unusual.  i could've sworn the ubuntu website used to host all of the old versions
