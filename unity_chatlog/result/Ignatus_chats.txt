 so, I still can't run unity on my laptop, fresh install natty gm. Additional drivers window says "This driver is activated, but not in use" regarding Nvidia current. any workarounds?
 bblz; got the same problem here. it was working fine under maverick for me
 seems to me there's alot of us having problems with nvidia and unity/jockey in 11.04
 funny thing, it worked in beta1, beta2 broke it, now it's semi broken
 it works fine on my desktop tower, but my laptop is a big no go. funny...alsmot
 oh well, if there's no fix for it yet, i'll just have to make do with classic for now
 another problem on my dekstop though, i've got no volume slider no more, it says just waiting for sound system. but i have sound working. ideas?
 i can't adjust the volume in my brand spanking new natty system. volume indicator says no label, and clicking prefs gives a waiting for sound system to respond message
 i have sound working, and alsamixer displays al channels. what's up with my indicator then?
 clean install = :/
