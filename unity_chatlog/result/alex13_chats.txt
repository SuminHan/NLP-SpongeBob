 I cannot boot into ubuntu!  I need help.  All I see is a black screen.
 Ubuntu 11.04 installed but I can't boot, all I get is a black screen and that's it.
 @sebsebseb I don't know because I can't boot into ubuntu to find out.
 How do I send people private messages?
 I really want 11.04 to work for me.  Really bad!
