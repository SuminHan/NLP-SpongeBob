 Sorry to bother you, but does anybody know a proper answer to http://askubuntu.com/questions/37843/where-do-i-place-a-file-for-bookmarks-for-all-users ? Ubuntu adds its default bookmarks to Firefox 4, but what mechanism is used ? I checked /etc/firefox/profile/bookmarks.html is definitely not used anymore...
 I noticed that there is also ubiquitous about:config value distribution.canonical.bookmarksProcessed in Firefox 4, but I cannot find out, where the default bookmarks are stored and how they are processed. I'm really digging it, so any hints are welcome if you have no solution...
