 greetings channel, I cannot create a file in a directory that has group write permissions for a group I belong to :-(
 drwxrwxr-x   6 root   webdev  4096 2011-05-03 10:59 srv    (these are the permissions for the /srv directory. I belong to the webdev group, but cannot create anything in the directory)
 so if root owns a directory, the group permissions don't apply?
 llutz: id as actual user does not list webdev, but "groups" as actual user does.
 llutz: thanks! logging off and logging back in solved the problem. I can now write to the directory
 llutz: hmmm what are the data structures/files that get updated on reboot?
 llutz: are the groups that a user belong to a part of the environment?
 llutz,quiescens: hmm ... so the groups command just reads the /etc/groups file.
 herbs: so what would be a good setting for /srv/
 herbs: what if the webdev group wants to add a new website inside /srv (webdev = webadmin group)
 quiescens:  the "id" command did not show the group change before re-login, but the "groups" command did
 herbs: the webdev group needs to be able to create directories inside /srv
 quiescens,llutz: I just tried googling, trying to find out where the environment for a process is stored ... what data structures, what source do I need to look at?
 quiescens: thanks! I'm looking at the kernel sources
 Herbs: yes, thanks! the problem was solved. I was just trying to do some extra learning about how the users group info is stored in memory when he logs in.
