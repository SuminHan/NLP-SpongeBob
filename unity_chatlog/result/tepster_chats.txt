 Paolo_CT: did you reinstall libreoffice?
 Paolo_CT: unity is rather buggy i'm finding
 Paolo_CT:  check under shortcuts in the control center
 Paolo_CT: I found that upgrading causes more bugs. When i do a new install, it was much more better
 Paolo_CT: If you plan on going back, you might as well try a fresh install of 11.04 first
 i take offense :p
 andygraybeal: it has something to do with your video card

 and if you install the compiz manager, you can make the launcher do all sorts of flashy things like giggle or flash.
 the only weird issue i had was using it with google chrome..sometimes it doesn't register that i have it open
