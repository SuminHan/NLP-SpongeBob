 hi, just installed Natty, noticing that the Unity desktop is not functional at all
 it flashes my icons for a second, then goes blank
 anyone else have problems with the Unity desktop?
 hi, can someone tell me why the Unity desktop is causing my screen to blink?  GNOME works perfectly fine.
 scorch_: no, desktop
 scorch_: processor is a P4 2.8 GHz, but I don't think that should matter
 how do I wipe the compiz-config settings?  Turning on Unity within GNOME and restarting just caused my desktop to start blinking again
