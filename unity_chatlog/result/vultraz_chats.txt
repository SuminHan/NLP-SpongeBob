 who to talk to
 where do i report 11.04 bugs?
 new GRUB seems to send signal to the numlock key to turn it on at boot
 so it's hard to enter a password
 on a laptop keybpard
 because most keys get locked
 also sometimes it turns on mute and I have to shutdown and turnon
 turn on*
 also yesterday at boot Unity disappeared and I got the non-unity 10.10 interface
 why is natty so buggy?
 :P
 ;)
 Guest29994; lol
 jetole: I think so too
 jetole: ya
 jetole: we'll probably have 11.10 before 11.04 is really stable
 anyway I don't mind it has nice interface
