 Trying to install JTR with 64bit support on 11.04 and getting an error on openssl/sha.h "file not found"
 can't seam to figure out what libary I need to install
 coz_: thx
 I was missing libssl-dev
 I was searching for openssl and that's why I didn't find it
 with apt-cache
 It did
 thank y ou
 does ubuntu use some special file other then /etc/profile
 I'm trying to add directory to the PATH and it's not working
 ikonia: two lines
 PATH=$PATH:/home/username/bin
 export PATH
 I have executable scripts in that directory
 but Iam not able to run them
 genii-around: thanks
 that helped
 do I need to run that everry time I reboot
 cause I thought after I killed my terminal and started a new one it would autmatically re-read the profile
 gotcah sweet
 thanks all!
