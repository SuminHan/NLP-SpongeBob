 Hi, I'm trying to access my NTFS RAID partition in 11.04. How do I get access into it from Ubuntu?
 KNUBBIG: Yes, it did work under 10.10.
 I'm having problems trying to get into my NTFS RAID partition under 11.04, when it worked under 10.10. Any ideas on how to do this?
 I'm still having trouble trying to access my NTFS raid under 11.04 I have looked at my packages and it seems that dmraid is already there. There are references to the RAID, but nothing useful.
 ohsix: How do you do that?
 ohsix: dmraid seems to be for software RAIDs, I have a hardware one.
 ohsix:  It is an nvidia raid controller.
 ohsix:  I thought it was hardware-based. Not sure why it would be software based, but still, dmraid finds them. So the next step is to get it mounted.
 I hope I'm on the right track here. I have found that mdarray knows that my RAID exists, but now I want to mount it. Would mdadm be needed? Or something else?
 escott: I meant dmarray. It has found my RAID, so 11.04 knows it exists.
 escott: Now I need to know how to get it mounted.
 escott: dmraid knows it's there. What command do I use to mount the array?
 Okay, does anyone know how to assemble and mount the software RAID array I have?
 Hi, I have a problem with g15daemon under 11.04. When I attempt to start it up, it hangs, telling me that it couldn't find "/dev/input/uinput". I have attempted to use "/dev/uinput/", but it hangs. Any ideas, or just file a big report?

 Hi, I'm having problems with g5daemon under 11.04. It hangs with the error "/dev/input/uinput cannot be found". I tried to fix it by changing the setting to "/dev/uinput" but no go. Any ideas?

 Hi, I have been looking for an answer to the g15 crash. It seems that uinput is missing from /dev. Any ways to fix it?

 Hi, how do I change the boot args in Grub2 under 10.10?
 Hi, last awnser was good, but now I'm having another problem. It seems like my ubuntu system has lost the normal theme, defaulting to GNOME's default. What could have happened to cause that?
 RoDiMuS-X: Thanks, I'll try it now.
