 hi! first of all: congrats on the new ubuntu, seems like a great release!
 only have one problem though: i have an hp mini 210 and although all problems i had to conquer on 10.10 have been solved, one remains: the touchpad gives a lot of problems when for example wanting to select things
 it's very jumpy. have been looking for solutions again but honestly ive tried so many things from synaptics that im pretty confused :)
 hi guys
 i love the unity interface
 anyone know when work starts on 11.10
