 hi! Installed natty beta2 a week ago. Now that the official release is out, do I have to reinstall again?
 kdubois: no dist-upgrade necessary?
 "battery has a very low capacity". It keeps always popping up. How can I disable it?
 ayecee: LOL.... ;) Just looked for a cheaper solution...
 ayecee: well, popping out the battery is not a good idea I think. After all I have just enough charge left to do a normal shutdown in an event of a power failure
 ayecee: Tried the solution. Logged out and in again, and it still there... I guess I have to buy a new one ;)

 Someone please help... I try to build a custom live cd with nvidia drivers on it. Is there any way to automate at bootup the process of chosing the nvidia driver instead of nouveau? If so is there a way to have mesa for computers which haven't nvidia?
 n3glv: It is, running classic desktop right now
 Someone please help... I try to build a custom live cd with nvidia drivers on it. Is there any way to automate at bootup the process of chosing the nvidia driver instead of nouveau? If so is there a way to have mesa for computers which haven't nvidia?
 ohsix: This is not to distribute... Only for my own personalised usb-stick
 ohsix: tried this method, but when I go to a computer with an ATI card I haven't acceleration...
 ohsix: till maverick I made a script that copied or removed an xorg.config in the case there was an nvidia driver
 ohsix: Now I see xorg.config got obsolete
 ActionParsnip: Believe me, it worked... It was scripted to do a delete during bootup, or to copy a customized xorg.config.nvidia in it's place
 c'mon guys I'll accept nouveau made some good progress, but it's way slower than the prop thingy
 rgr: that's correct about nvidia. If nouveau comes that far, I will surely use it... After all I am an avid open-source fan too, but if something works good I have to accept it

 Hi! How can I connect remotely to another computer on the same LAN?
 allu2: with ssh all is ok. I want X if possible a gnome desktop
 hi everyone! Using putty logged into my server via ssh. Can use x applications. How can I start a whole gnome session in a window?
 AcuinParsnip: Just seems cool to do remote administration using the entire GUI
 ActionParsnip: Just seems cool to do remote administration using the entire GUI
 IsmAvatar: I use jockey (system-administration-additional drives)
 IsmAvatar: just type in a terminal jockey-gtk
 IsmAvatar: As of unity, I really don't like it... Makes my laptop like a BIG cellphone ;)
 IsmAvatar: why don't you try in a terminal sudo nvidia-xconfig
 IsmAvatar: You have to reboot for the changes to take effect
 IsmAvatar: you didn't run with sudo!
 IsmAvatar: OK! Now you HAVE to reboot!!!
 IsmAvatar: for what it is, the new xorg.conf is written. could you pastebin the contents of /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
 IsmAvatar: yes! I think everything is ok now
 IsmAvatar: so cross your fingers and reboot!
 could someone tell me what sound settings I can use for wine? It loses sound constantly
 IsmAvatar: Is everything ok?
 IsmAvatar: could you run glxgears on terminal?
 IsmAvatar: it is on a package called mesa-utils
 IsmAvatar: hmm... Maybe you have the nouveau driver in use. Tell me, did you see the Nvidia-logo upon booting>
 IsmAvatar: That's the nouveau driver already. Could you run glxinfo | grep vendor ?
 IsmAvatar: well as it seems you are using glx from Nvidia. Which card do you have?
 IsmAvatar: Are you on Natty?
 IsmAvatar: Another thing we could try is in a terminal galternatives
 IsmAvatar: search in the left column for gl_conf
 IsmAvatar: Well, now you got me... Your driver is well in use... I don't know what else could be the cause...
 IsmAvatar: This is a bit extreme... You could go through synaptic and reinstall nvidia-current. Then in a terminal do a sudo update-initramfs -u
 IsmAvatar: and then reboot again
 IsmAvatar: Maybe you are affected by this bug too...
 IsmAvatar: The only thing I could think about is that your initrd has not been updated. Maybe that causes trouble
 IsmAvatar: I am running on a 8600m gt and glxgears gives something like 14000 fps
 IsmAvatar: You are right... Who knows? the current nvidia driver has been made in a hurry as I can imagine, since some distros switched to xorg 1.10. My card seems to cope with it. Maybe there will be a new driver soon. Why don't you check on the nvidia site directly?
 IsmAvatar: The whole idea of unity sucks I think. I like the classic desktop as it is.
 IsmAvatar: Maybe they try to have some concurrence to gnome 3. As to show them that they can do better ;)
 IsmAvatar: One of the reasons I never could get well with KDE. I like classic desktops... And on top of all, I like the command-line ;)
 Someone who knows about ssd drives... Please... I have dd'ed on a drive. It disconnected without reason, and now after reconnecting it it shows the partitions I had before dd and is mounted read-only. What can I do?
