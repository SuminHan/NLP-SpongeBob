 naoko, have you tried Alt+Tab? It happens to me sometimes and I can access it from there
 Does anyone know if WUBI is working with 11.04 yet?
 Hey guys, I need help removing kde, I installed kubuntu-desktop and when I try to remove it using the puregnome instructions from psychocats I get an error http://paste.ubuntu.com/601393/
 Dr_Willis, it says it's for Natty
 "Getting Back to a Pure Gnome on Ubuntu
 Note, this applies only to Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty)."
 Ok, I think I may have fixed it :)
 sudo apt-get install default-jre
 researcher123, the installer for 11.04 should have an option to replace ubuntu 10.04
 Halt, have you installed the appropriate codecs?
 hmm..
