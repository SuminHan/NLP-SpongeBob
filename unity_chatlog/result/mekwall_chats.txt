 so.... I'm trying to mount an nfs share in userspace (using unfs3), but I get the unknown filesystem errror
 anyone have any experience with ubuntu and unfs3 ?
 top - 16:13:26 up 1074 days,  6:31,  2 users,  load average: 53.07, 52.88, 45.52 ... hrm
 not feeling very well :P
 wtf
 why would top show this high load?
 sar reports: all      0.08      0.00      0.21      0.21      0.00     99.50
