 Anyone know how to shrink the size of thunderbird's font in the thread (I think that's what it's called) pane?  I can shrink it in the actual messages, but not there or in the mail folders pane
 I'm looking to get firefox 4 in lucid.  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-stable   Is that the best way?
 Dr_Willis, thank you sir; I just wanted to make sure this was the recommended dosage before I went and did it.
