 after natty upgrade from lucid my network card says "link is not ready" in dmesg... I cannot enable it in any way, suggestions?
 intel agn4965
 tried modprobing iwlagn, rfkill, nothing makes the wireless work. Works fine in windows on same computer
 usr13, intel agn4965
 usr13, actually it has been a problem since the last dist upgrade, I always had to right click the icon to enable the wireless and then it would connect. Now I have to rfkill to un-gray the "enable wireless" item in the right click menu but clicking it makes no networks show and dmesg still says link is not ready. Tried removing battery, holding power button for 30 seconds and booting up again,
 same problem. Windows is fine.
 usr13, thanks I will try
 brb, reboot
 usr13, wicd did the trick together with sudo rfkill unblock wifi - thank you so much! must be a bug with natty and iwlagn...
