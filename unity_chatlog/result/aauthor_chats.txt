 Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask this... but... I just installed gnome3 on ubuntu 11.04, however, when I attempt to log in I always get a "could not update /home/tom/.ICEAuthority.  I've checked to make sure that my user and it's group is the owner (and they are) what else could be wrong?
 Thanks Zorlin, I just know that gnome 3 isn't supported yet. :D
 Thanks LjL. I've tried rebooting, and I still have the same trouble.
 LjL: this is my ls -al:
 -rwxrwxrwx 1 tom tom 668 2011-05-01 14:42 .ICEauthority
 LjL: OK, I'll give it a shot.

 Hello Sharp:
 furous: Hmm... I'm sorry, I don't think I have an answer for you.  (Though that certainly doesn't mean that one doesn't exsist.)
 furous: I did encounter problems during the upgrade, and ended up doing a clean install which worked out fine for me.
 furous: I looked it up, and your graphics card is supported.
 celthunder: furous is getting and error when he logs in that Unity can't start in this session.
 celthunder: But it worked fine for him in the liveCD
 furous: Have you done anything to change how you log in since you installed ubuntu?
