 Having issues with the Natty installer.
 It keeps saying I have too many primary partitions on my disc
 nit-wit 4 primary, 1 extended
 nit-wit when did that change?
 jordan_u that's how it's set up
 /dev/sda1-3 are used as primary
 /dev/sda4 hosts the extended, which is /dev/sda5
 Gah, come on.  I set up this partition structure when I installed 10.10... What is the problem.
 *grump* finally got it working by doing a "custom" install, and reformatting my 10.10 install.
 I like that the installer gives you stuff to do while waiting for the files to copy.
 Thanks Ubuntu.
 RPM has long been a good package manager.
 But ubuntu just works.
 xsinick dunno haven't booted up unity yet.
 xsinick dunno.  I can always just go to slackware 13.37
 Gah!  Downloading packages, 24 minutes remaining?  Wish they just included those on a DVD release.
 Medfordite Download the mall?  Sounds like fun.
 tanath one ring to bring the mall, and in the darkness bind it!
 tanath I think you're on to something.  My version just ends up with a big mall of twine.
 crap... Now its' 26 minutes left.
 Somehow I'm on Microsoft minutes.
 I think xsinick is a Redhat shill.
 Well, it's down to 9 minutes now... Just bouncing all over the place.
 _ryx_ we heard you.  What kind of monitor do you have?
 Ok...  I went to do dishes, and came back, and now it's at 14 minutes remaining.   This is getting strange.
 24 -> 26 -> 9 -> 24 -> 14  I suppose that at least half the time the number is going down.
 pyrodood what happens?
 pyrodood try ctrl-alt-f1 and see if it's completely locked up or if it's just having prolblems with your vid card.
 pyrodood it sounds like the gui install having some difficulty recognizing your video card.  try command line install?
 pfifo like a screenshot of the cli?
 I just did an upgrade in about an hour and a half.
 Seems to be working so far, but I haven't checked all of the Nvidia stuff.
 seems to work ok with the default NVidia drivers, upgrading to the "current" ones now to see what happens.
 All in all, I think I like Unity, but it's hard to tell what apps are installed.
 carandraug yep.  Hard to decide what I think about it just yet though
 carandraug I'm running on a reasonably modern system, but it's reasonably snappy for me.
 carandraug, yeah, that's definitely a bit dated.  I'd almost suggest running xubuntu on that instead of gnome.
 I'm still hoping Canonical picks up the old Sun CDE, and produces cubuntu
 lol that was actually a joke.
 Gah!  Funky scrollbars.
 Ah, Unity is much better with the up-to date Nvidia drivers.
 BinaryMan I installed from Natty 64 bit image last night.  Worked ok, except for some partionioning confusion.
 cablop lots of changes... Unity is definitly something to get used ot.
 Theoretician I only installed it last night, but it seems to work fine, on a fresh install
 cablop the left bar autohides
 Theoretician You'll need to build new muscle memory in terms of where things are, and how to use the window manager.
 perlsyntax i'm surprised that Natty still includes Eclipse Ganymede.
 perlsyntax no, the newest is Helios.
 cablop Mine installed just fine with an NVidia Card and onboard sound on an ECS motherboard ( don't have the specs handy right now )
 cablop it sounds like people are having trouble with upgrades on NVidia hardware though.
 eiriksvin were you upgrading yours or was it a fresh install?
 JoshDreamland in unity prefs is under the applications.
 JoshDreamland I kind of like typing to find my programs... it feels like im in a CLI again.
 JoshDreamland wouldn't know... i don't use Windows 7.
 How do I install Oracle Java?
 Oracle java isn't showing up in Natty though.
 exit
 scorch2 what process is running?
 scorch2 try top... What is pegging your CPU?
 scorch2 go to a terminal, type "top" and see what's on the top of the list.
 scorch2 sometimes pressing "m" to sort by memory usage is also helpful.
 scorch2 never heard of xflux.
 scorch2 what's the %cpu for flux?
 scorch2 not sure that was a good idea, but give it a bit to empty out request queues and such.
