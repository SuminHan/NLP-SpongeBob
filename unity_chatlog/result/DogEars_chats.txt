 Why do people use Virtual box instead of qemu with Aqemu?
 Incarus6, OK on 11.04?
 Incarus6, I will install and try. Thanks
 Incarus6, XP pro
 Incarus6, It is to run a business app
 Incarus6, Does 7 run OK?
 Incarus6, Virtualbox - ose ?
 atlef: First time with virtual so this is a turning point
 Incarus6: Whats the difference?
 Incarus6: The repository only lists the OSE versions
 Incarus6: The VB website has all versions available. Downloading atm
 Why does Virtualbox need me to reinstall ose-dkms and remove ose-guest-dkms to allow it to start? All was working OK last night?
