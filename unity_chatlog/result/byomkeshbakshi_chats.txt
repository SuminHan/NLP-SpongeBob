 hi I tried to install ubuntu using wubi, but got this error
 OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: u'E:\\ubuntu\\install\\ubuntu-10.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso'
 actionparsnip: no
 ActionParsnip: it made a logfile where this error is mentioned. Also, I just ran the installer from website, did not download an ISO image.
 ActionParsnip: hmm, ok. Can you suggest proper way of installation?
 I am installing ubuntu on a parition on windows machine. I have downloaded ubuntu iso and checked md5 and burned to CD. I am able to rub ffrom CD. Now, when I install how to know which partition to choose because installer does not give option like D, E or F (my drives)
 izinucs:yes, i have 3 partions on harddrive - on one is installed windows, one where I keep data and one completly empty
 izinucs:48gb
 izinucs:ok..when i say manual, will installer pick this empty partiton?
 izinucs:ok..cool thanks
