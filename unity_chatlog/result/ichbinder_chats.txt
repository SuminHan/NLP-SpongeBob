 Hey there. When I start Skype from a link as an application it crashes after a few seconds. When I start it from a terminal or as application in terminal, it works smoothly. Any idea what could be the problem?
 nope, I start it not as root. Normal priviliges.
 so, nobody has an idea why skype works when it's started from terminal but not as an application?
