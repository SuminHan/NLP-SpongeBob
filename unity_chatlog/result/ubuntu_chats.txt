 ?
 Wasn't it suppose to be that 11.04 had Unity as default desktop?
 Dr_Willis, Same problem here.
 Dr_Willis, like whole Unity does not exist at all.
 Dr_Willis, my does have but I can not enable Unity anyway.
 Does all work ok with the upgrade???
 Im thinking if I should or should not upgrade now
 Wow, better I wait
 Does unity looks and works better than gnome??
 Ohh and what about gnome 3??
 I like gnome
 Its the first time that I test this chat and is very helpful, thanks to all people for the invaluable information that you share in this channel, see you tomorrow!

 Hi! Is there any way to combine unallocated partition as one here - http://imagebin.org/151122?
 Is it possible to combine unallocated partition as one here - http://imagebin.org/151122?
 Dr_Willis: Can you see this http://imagebin.org/151122? These are my partition. /dev/sda6 is /home
 Incarus6: unallocated - 9.99 GiB and unallocated 979.00 MiB is what I hope to combine
 Dr_Willis: And I'm not sure how does moving/resizing affects data
 Dr_Willis: Well, I want to add 979MiB to 9.99GiB
 Incarus6: Dr_Willis: How does resizing affects data? /dev/sda6 and /dev/sda7 are my /home and / of current system. I'm on LiveUSB now
 Oh
 Incarus6: Well, how about combining 1.02MiB and 979.00 MiB to swap?
 Incarus6: 4GiB
