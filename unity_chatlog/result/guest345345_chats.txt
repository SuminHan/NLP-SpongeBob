 gimme gimme gimme
 Yeah...there are still 15 hours left "today"
 Last release was quite early in the day
 if your close to UTC that is
 You don't need a crystal ball to expect abounding inpatience
 probably more like within the next 10 hours to be honest
 probably less
 just the daily build on CD
 Yeah from VCS
 Im assuming he means Version Control
 all packaged are managed by LP/BZR
 so yes...its from VCS
 How many people are using Emapthy for IRC here?
 lol
 well I am
 It sucks but I loe the integration
 love*
 Anyone know how to hack Empathy to support SASL auth?
 everyone needs to put their epeen back in the trouders now
 trousers(/pants)*
 Solution: WAIT!
 Canonical HQ is GMT+1 now
 they have barely woken up yet
 vadviktor, yes....it will be amazing
 ATTENTION INPATIENT PEOPLE: The time at Canonical HQ is now 9:28.......give them chance to wake up and get to the office before you complain or ask where 11.04 is!!
 Incarus6: where have you read that?
 Incarus6: is that just hearsay or does it have some basis?
 Technically you can dist-upgrade but it's usually better and cleaner to fresh install
 @Rehan
 A few hours
 vadviktor: yes...that's right....but not yet
 vadviktor: or you can do: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
 Rehan: What do you need to back-up?
 Rehan: personally, I have a script for configuting every new system in Install automatically
 Rehan: You can just copy your /home directory but it's not very clean
 Rehan: I see no reason why it wouldn't work.....I've been testing since alpha and it's very stable now
 Rehan: yeah, what JR0cket1 said
 Rehan: that is probably because of restricted drivers....you can still install them and try to in the Live environment
 Rehan: and 11.04 has improved a fair bit on the drivers front
 elzoog: Unluck....because the work day has barely started at Canonical HQ
 Unlucky*
 vadviktor: if you're on an atom....x86
 http://www.ubuntu.com/
 You can just dual boot to try it if you are worried a LiveUSB will skew the experience too much
 and then overwrite both when you're ready to upgrade for real
 fire up "jockey-gtk" and see if it's offering any resitrcted drivers
 matto1990: yeah that sounds about same as last time
 just after they eat lunch lol
 Rehan: Use Ubuntu
 Rehan: Kubuntu is horrifically ugly
 Yeah...KDE stack is built on better technology......but it's naming conventions are annoying and it's full of BLOAT
 Zavior: 2.7
 Zavior: np
 Zavior: actually I just checked....11.04 is running 2.7.1
 velcroshooz: that's not necessarily true....it only needs to be as big as resident memory...not total memory
 or the average you generally use anyway
 Rehan: a default install allocates 1:1 memory:swap
 so unless you used custom partitions it should be enough
 or unless you added more memory since
 oh...well that is not default then
 velcroshooz: yeah....that is optimal if you plan to hibernate
 velcroshooz: but not strictly required most of the time
 tutorials are generally aimed at people who prefer not to think much
 and the easiest way to encapsulate anyone is to just play safe
 everyone*
 Rehan: do you really need Win7 for something?
 Rehan: 10GB is more than enough for an average ubuntu install but it may not give it enough room to allocate the recommended swap partition
 Rehan: and that may be your problem
 Rehan: yes...swap must be seperate......the installer allocates it automatically
 Rehan: for a defualt full-disk install it will generally be 1:1 with your memory
 Rehan: but if you only give it 10GB disk to work with...maybe it will allocate less
 Rehan: I'm not sure exactly because I usually do custom and allocate swap myself
 Rehan: yes, any install will allocate swap by default
 Rehan: the simple/default install will hide it from you but it will do it nonetheless
 Rehan: Windows and Mac to exactly the same too
 do*
 Rehan: actually...perhaps Windows 7 only uses a "pagefile" by default....but it's recommended to have a seperate parition for Win7 just the same
 Rehan: but Windows sucks of course....so I can understand why they don't follow best practices by default
 Taking bets on release time.......my money is on 13:15 GMT
 Macer: I've been testing it for a while now....to be honest...it feels more stable that 10.10 by now
 jatt: beta or not...it's still a huge improvement over gnome panel
 jatt: lol, that bug is just an subjective complaint
 jatt: can't please everyone
 jatt: some people have an irrational aversion to change
 jatt: not really....it's all just heckling from the peanut gallery
 Macer: no.....that's the old netbook edition
 Macer: that no longer exists
 Macer: that looks just like a mockup from Gnome3
 but It doesn't look anything like it now
 Gnome3 is effing awful
 Unity may have a few flaws to iron out...but it's much faster and more usable thatn gnome3 shell
 Macer: KDE but with a Unity-like shell would be perfect
 but KDE can never get usability right
 it's looks like Windows ....but worse
 Incarus6: not sure...I haven't looked into that......I know the Plymouth boot screen needs open source drivers because of Kernel modesetting
 Incarus6: but there is a non OpenGL version of Unity for people who can't use the 3d one
 Incarus6: it's packaged as unity-2d in the archives
 Incarus6: written with Qt QML
 Incarus6: as far as I know.....you only need OpenGL support....but I could be wrong
 Incarus6: or more specifically open GLES
 Rehan: the boot screen
 Incarus6: oh...yeah I had heard something to that affect....
 Incarus6: I only buy Intel graphics anyway
 Incarus6: So long as they can handle 1080 video I don't care
 Incarus6: I don't game
 Incarus6: anything more than an Intel HD integrated is overkill for me
 Incarus6: Why burn watts if you don't need to ;) ?
 Intel HD cards have HDMI out too
 and they're ultra low power
 Sounds cool....but I'm not picky about graphics really
 just low power and plays video is enough
 The reason I dig Intel is because they have done quite a bit for Open Source....and their own drivers are completely open
 shmoolikipod: yeah...but you need to update the apt cache first
 Rehan: because proprietary means the manufacturers are solely responsible for progress
 Rehan: and they couldn't give a sh*t about many platforms
 or improving support on them
 Intel Graphics are trailing the pack by miles......but their drivers are open....they're by far the best choice for Linux unless you need gaming power
 But to be fair....gaming on Linux ain't great anyway
 elzoog: I don't really game anyway...but if I did...I think it makes more sense to have a dedicated machine
 elzoog: No need to beat the shit out of your office machine by playing games on it ;)
 All the inpatient fanatics should be running beta if they love it that much
 Why aren't you inpatient folks testing beta and helping to improve it? ;)
 Rehan: yeah, as nice as the ideology of open source is......at the moment...the proprietary drivers are a lot better
 elzoog: It's possible to do...but I remember it being pretty unreliable last time I tried
 Yeah proprietary is fine if that's the way they want it....just important that open source drivers are developed in paralel in case they ever pull support
 vibhav: it means you made floodbot angry
 The persistence seems to work ok for documents etc.
 but didn't seem to work that great for packages
 when I tried anyway
 Incarus6: oh cool.....I might try again then
 Incarus6: I have a script for installing and configuring any new machine I roll out - would be nice to throw the script on the USB and pull packages from the local cache
 Incarus6: so you are saying.....if I pull some packages to the apt cache on my USB stick......I can install from those packages when I install later?
 Incarus6: cuz it's been a while since I tried it.....but it never seemed to work before
 matto1990: yes!
 matto1990: Assuming your hardware isn't too obscure
 jatt: Except the fact that using 64-bit floating points means his average memory usage will go up quite a bit
 Incarus6: yeah I know that.....but can you reference those packages for a hard installation later?
 Incarus6: like the same as using the CD in sources.list?
 Incarus6: I know you could dpkg them....but it's kind of a pain
 Incarus6: because if you bypass apt...it doesn't log dependencies
 Incarus6: easier, maybe...but not as seemless
 Incarus6: it should be possible....and it's the most intuitive way to do it
 Incarus6: but I guess very few people need that ability
 http://releases.ubuntu.com/natty/ still takes me to the beta releases
 yeah exactly
 and it even says beta 2 at the top of the page
 oh...scratch that....effing cache
 he's right....it's there
 just had a stubborn cache
 Yeah it's out....they should have set the page cache to expire today
 lol
 andeeeuk: yeah
 Incarus6: yeah I did a shift-F5 in Chrome
 has to clear the whole cache
 not sure why
 But the image link is the real deal
 loka: that's not bloat...that just you messing up your system
 it's generally not smart to be running 2 environments when it's still beta
 loka: if you want to try a different environment just for a while...I suggest using virtualbox
 or a live disk
 they generally don't play well together
 and Linux doesn't babysit core packages like Windows does....they all just packages
 you can fuck them up pretty easily
 jesus...Windows is still taking 5 hours to install?!
 what a pile of bloat lol
 Ubuntu+kickstart script takes less than 30 minutes for a fullt installed and configured machine here
 It's tragic that you have to download and install things one by one on a new Windows install
 even Mac users have homebrew and macports
 Windows is just awful
 Nefertiti: now
 Ruuumb0: no thanks
 lol
 hah busted joining the PHP channel...you must be pretty ashamed now
 ;)
 msb__:it is
 just not announced yet
 daskog: Yeah I use Ubuntu for development, testing and deployment
 daskog: it's fine....best platform I've ever used
 daskog: To be honest...I find Inkscape better for mock-ups and vectors that Photoshop/Illustrator
 don't even need Wine
 daskog: Give Inkscape a try...it's really clean and fast compared to Adobe suite
 daskog: you will probably want to hate it a whole due to the new learning curve.....but it's save as native SVG
 daskog: which has a lot of advatages for web dev
 daskog: even more so soon
 s/whole/while
 someone should start up a bit here that prints the direct links every time someone says "11.04"
 bot*
 Incarus6: do you read German?
 Incarus6: cuz I have no idea what that says lol
 Incarus6: oh :)
 Incarus6: does it say what they modify?
 andeeeuk: why not just download and do fresh install?
 If people can't have a new install looking exactly like their old install within 15 minutes...they're doing something wrong
 Between Ubuntu One and a config script.....I can have an identical system within about 10 minutes
 from a single command
 vibhav: because ChanServ has muted you
 beucase you were flooding
 by waiting until it expires
 and then behaving like a good boy
 vibhav: you should do /msg ChanServ I am very sorry sir....I win't do it again
 haha
 maybe he will go easy on you
 omg he really did
 priceless
 !guidelines
 !g test
 vibhav: the OP can set a ban timeout however long he wants
 He should have warned you first
 unless a bot autobanned you for flooding or something
 well...I would have thought common sence should be enough
 but.....
 sense*
 Curly_Q: .htaccess and .htpasswd are entirely different things
 I suggest Nginx as a fix to that
 #nginx
 as a fix to Apache's hideous inefficiency I mean
 Naib: YES!
 !apparmor
 @mbn_18
 kaatta: nubs shouldn't be editing that file
 kaatta: What are you trying to do?
 Ymer-: didnt'y uo forget the "sudo"?
 and vim is installed by default...not everyone loves vim
 isnt*
 gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
 that's probably the easiest way for a "nub"
 harvi: gksudo
 Ctrl+Alt+T for terminal
 gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
 be careful
 tsimpson: it IS available for download....even if it hasn't been announced
 and it IS the final image
 tsimpson: wrong wrong wrong
 it's released....end of story
