 hello
 :)
 well... I am sorry for this question... but I read a lot of FAQs and... I couldn't solve my instalation's problem
 may I ask for some help about how to install ubunto for netbook?
 ??? nobody to help?
 you are right maco... but I explained it
 my problem
 is...
 I am installing ubunto in my netbook
 where already I have installed W7
 and it has 4 partitions already...
 I have no options in ubunto to installing with win7
 only erase all the disk
 or manually
 yes
 I know Walther
 but my question... Have I another option?
 I mean... I don't want to delete my partitions because my job
 got it maco... it is not a bad idea
 ... I think more than one is extended... but isntalations system don't allow me to install it
 maco... in anycase... if I put one as extended... if do I format the primary upper this extended... the extended will be formated too?
 ...
 I can't consider a clear install... too much information very important... and moreover... I need to work with win7 because university and job
 ok WaltherFi... got it... but it doesn't work. I tried already and doesn't work because I have already 4 primary partitions
 well... maybe next question is easier... for community... I have ubunto in a usb-key. Now I am running it in my netbook. I have internet connection... and I am trying to install aircrack-ng suite there... but I can't not... it say "dependency is no satisfiable:iw" What is happening?
 mmm got it
 ok ok...
 I will try install ubunto by your advices...
 there is another release? yesterday I downloaded the last one... it was not 10.10?
 uuuh today... for netbook version too? I will check it right now... maybe I have a solution there....
 thank you for all the answers .รง:) I will try to continue from this point.
 have a nice day!!! :)
