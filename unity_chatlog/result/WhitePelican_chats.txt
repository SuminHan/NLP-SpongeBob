 hello all, I need help with Medibuntu for natty
 my webcam doesn't work with Skype but works with cheese, I'm running natty. any ideas?
 it works with Cheese
 I close cheese and try the skype test
 yes gnea
 i get no error, I just don't see anyhing on the test
 yes I expect it to auto-detect the camera
 medibuntu
 actually, check that
 it was in the repoitory
 so I guess it was from medibuntu
 lcb, it works fine in cheese
 no issues
 I ran reconfigure as suggested and nothing happened. what next?
 Gnea, I remembered there were a couple of libraries I had to reference prior, now it works. but now i have no system tray and it doesn't remember my password
 lcb, yes
 no, I remembered I had a script that referenced a couple of v4l liraries and then it runs skype
 but now, no sytem tray icon, and it forgets my password, lcb
 lcb, from medibuntu or the skype webite?
