 I tried installing MSTTCOREFONTS and I got a Microsoft EULA. How do I continue? There is no 'Click OK', what do I press? The package manager is blocked at this stage.
 I tried pressing enter or page down etc...
 <Dr_Willis> thanks, life saver
 Dr_Willis: I tried closing the console, but the package manager still kept the locks on
