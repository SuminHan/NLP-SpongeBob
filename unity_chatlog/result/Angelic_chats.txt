 robin0800: The system thats connected to the wifi network that the ubuntu machine has greyed out is right under the router so I am basically saying I don't understand why would it be greyed out.
 ngc604: http://hardware4linux.info/component/19645/ <--- is the only info I gather when looking it up.
 ngc604: Otherwise there is no numbers on the back that I see on the hardware.
 robin0800: It's usually connected through wifi, but as of the moment I am on another machine(Windows machine).
 robin0800: It sees the wifi network in the area but its greyed out, and the network thats greyed out is currently connected to my windows machine so it can't be out of range.
 Eyes_Only: it returns nothing back.
 robin0800: No.
 robin0800: It sees it, as the aironet wireless communications cisco aironet wireless 802.11
