 so what we use instead of unity, since my laptop says does not support unity?
 this new release, personally i dont like, first got hang up after the install, was not able to boot (so i had to delete the old one......finally manage to install this natty versin just to find out its like a damm vista
 where can i take off that bloody bar
 u ubuntu developters, want me to go back to windows or what
 whats up with that new bars, pointless and i cant customize that properly
 think i just go back to ver 10
 im locked now. cant configure the gui on this new version
 on this nathy version are u allowed to move ur gui? move the bars etc?
 i think im in ubuntu classic since the laptop at start pointed me that cant run unity so im running on classic
 gonna check that....... thks
 thanks for pointing me out to log out and relog on classic, helped me, was about to install 10 again...
