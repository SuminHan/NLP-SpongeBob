 system monitor says my CPU(s) are running at 100% after i install 11.04, but the processes show 4-10% load. What's using up the rest?
 ohsix: kthnx back in a  minute
 ohsix: htop says the same. I add up all active processes and it's 13% cpu load. Htop says 100% on both cores, also. ??
 ohsix: yeah, top process is Compiz at 7%
 ok i'll go sudo 1 sec
 ohsix: Still just compiz at 7% in htop (sudo)
 ohsix: yes, solid white/teal, why?
 ohsix: I don't know what that is. The color should tell me something?
 ohsix: ok, any other utils or info dumps I can do to figure it out?
