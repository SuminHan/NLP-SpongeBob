 hello.  i just updated to 11.04, and now when i boot, i get "VFS: Cannot open root device "sda2" or unknown-block(0,0)", then Kernel panic - not syncing.  this is the same partition my 10.04 was on, and the grub config looks correct...
 hello.  i usually use netbeans, but it seems a bit sluggish on 11.04.  i am using open-jdk 6.  is another java recommended with the newest ubuntu?
