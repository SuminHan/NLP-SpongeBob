 hey guys, i got a new 6 button mouse, standard left right middle, then 3 on thumb forward back and thumb middle. i can't get linux to detect the middle thumb
 i even downloaded btnx in hopes it would detect and configure the buttons, but didn't
 any ideas?
 k
 yep, ok so i sudo cat, this is where its wierd - its not detecting middle thumb, but nor is it detecting scroll wheel left and right tilts, however btnx detected wheel left and right tilts
 yes, but nothing for left and right wheel tilts either, yet btnx detects left and right tilts as buttons - wierd...
 im not sure, i just haven't been able to get that middle thumb button working, its like linux is not seeing it at all, the mouse is brand new but the software is windows only so im kinda at a loss
 0-1-2-3?
 k 1 sec
 calamari, ok so i cat 1-2-3, nothing happens at all with mouse1 - and mouse 2 and 3 aren't found
 darn
 guess i'll just be stuck with out it sadly - dunno what else to do
 thx for your help cal
 use wireless
 i can't get 1 of 6 buttons on my new mouse to be seen by linux
 its got 3 normal left right middle, and 3 thumb forward back and middle
 linux doesn't see middle
 yea
 some cheap brand i got a best buy lol - rocketfish ergo - its a 2.4ghz wireless laser - model no. rf-mse14
 the software it came with is windows only, no linux support
 gonzalo: just post ur question
 gonzalo: are you running 11.04 now?
 try switching to ubuntu classic at log in and try to play with your program
 i know i've had a few problems with a few programs not liking the new unity system
 thauriswulfa: system settings > startup apps, just uncheck it and it won't load up any more
 lol yea thats what i was thinking, its just not supported at all, btnx and sudo cat doesn't see it, dunno what to do /sigh
