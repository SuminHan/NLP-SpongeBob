 Okay, somehow after I upgraded to 11.04 I broke GRUB. I've booted to my install via a SuperGRUB USB, but how do I go about fixing my grub setup?
 Anyone have any clues on how to fix a broken GRUB setup?
 Rehan: Somehow I broke it during the upgrade to 11.04
 Rehan: I'm booting off the installed system now (11.4 running fine even!) via SuperGrub.
 But I can't seem to fix it.
 sudo grub-install doesn't want to work. It Complains: Attempting to install GRUB to a partitionless disk or to a partition.  This is a BAD idea..
 Rehan: Well slight problem, I'm already in my install, not running of a live CD.
 Thus my active partition is already mounted.
