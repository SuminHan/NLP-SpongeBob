 Hi everyone, I updated from Lucid to Meerkat, and I keep having the main panel icons swap around every-time I power on the PC, all items on that panel are locked, which should stop them moving, but somehow they move around the panel and not in the positions I put them
 ahh ok thanks phoque_uni
 is 11.04 available in the update manager yet?
 as 11.04 is available on the main site, when would it be available in the update manager?
 ok, thanks, I'll wait
 wow, I just upgraded from Meerkat to 11.04, and even though there's a new interface, where do I find admin access?, such as 'Services'. startup programs' etc etc?
 or system monitor
 hehehe, ok, thanks
 also, when grub starts, my monitor shows frequency out of range, how do I fix it?
 anyone know how to fix the frequency out of range shown during grub
 do not use 11.04 unity, it is useless, there is no taskbar that is relied upon by progs such as cryptkeeper, use classic by starting the login screen app, then change the session to 'Classic'
 <h-dee> you can switch to classic gnome by logging out, and click your username, and select 'classic' at the bottom bar,,, or run the app called 'Login Screen' and change the session to 'Classic'
 11.04 sucks, I just now for no reason, got logged out of ubuntu and straight to the log in screen, all by itself,,, this never happened with 10.10
 can someone help me with using the passwords and encryption keys to configure with an SSH remote server?
 FYI, if anyone is having problems with unity, unity can be switched out, and the classic desktop returned, personally, unity sucks, and I use the classic gnome desktop,,,,unity does not have the taskbar that is reliant in apps like cryptkeeper
 if anyone is trying to use the passwords and encryption keys in Natty, there is a bug that won't allow uploading the key to a remote SSH server, it has been reported.
 Froq: for now, I would use PuTTy, and set the SSH server to interactive keyboard access
 anthony__: unity is very hard to customize, I would suggest switching to classic gnome desktop
 mastaofdidasta: try using sudo services network restart
 anthony__: I agree, unity looks good, but still needs more work, to be fully customizable
 anthony__: no idea,,, I switched to classic desktop, after extensively testing unity, and found it barely usable, it's ok for simple usage
 mastaofdisasta: try this:- sudo /etc/init.d/network restart
 anthony__: laters
 mastaofdisasta:  you might need to sudo -s then enter password, and try services network restart as root
 sudo -s gives you a root command prompt
 mmm, it maybe a bug that needs reporting to launchpad
 I use K3b, even though it uses the KDE libraries, it's still a good burner with a lot of templates to use
 unity works good with the recommended Nvidia drivers for the GeForce 7600 GS 512MB
 JoseeAntonioR: logging out and changing the session at login is not permanent, you can make the classic desktop permanent, byt running the app called 'Login Screen', then change the session there to classic
 JoseeAntonioR: try searching it in the package manager (ubuntu software center), I tried the search in there and it found it under ccsm
 I found the unity bar only auto hides when a window is open full screen, but did you try the launcher & menu settings in the system preferences?
 victorhugo289: if you're using nVidia, try running 'additional drivers' in the system section
 does it show any listed driovers?
 drivers*
 victorhugo289: have a look at this page:- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
 killaz: the logout and change session is only temporary, use the prog called 'Login Screen' and change the session to 'classic' there, it'll make it the default session for future natty restarts
 A reminder to anyone that doesn't like the new unity, go to system settings -> system -> Login Screen change session to classic, restart pc
 bsodmike: has mysql died?, you could try restarting using sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart
 jamil_1: open a terminal and type unity
 brian_: as far as I know, windows does not recognize LInux ext partitions, but Linux does recognize windows ntfs, and fat partitions, hence a Linux grub loader is used, but the windows loader would not know how to handle Linux partitions
 brian_ : wubi installes a grub loader, and also installes unbuntu in it's own folder in C:\ I tried it on a laptop running win7, the only way I can think of is using the windows add/remove to remove ubuntu and it returns windows loader back to it's previous state
 otherwise, the reason Linux uses grub, is so that it can recognize windows partitions and linux, but windows can not and does not recognize ext partitions
 nmaxchat: wine doesn't always support all win progs, ry using something like Vbox, Vmware player, or crossover office
 Vmware player is free, I use it and it works good
 nmaxchat: yw
 osoba_ use ccsm to autohide the bar:- http://maketecheasier.com/autohide-unity-launcher-in-ubuntu-natty/2011/04/20
 A reminder to anyone that wants to hide the unity sidebar, have a look at this site:- http://maketecheasier.com/autohide-unity-launcher-in-ubuntu-natty/2011/04/20
 osaba_: yw
 mitoni: if the (old?) pc has a supported video card, then I don't see why not
 bsodmike: type sudo service --status-all and see if mysql is listed as a service
 also is mysql listed in the startup applications, system settings -> Personal -> Startup Applications
 oh ok
 bsodmike: try this sudo service mysql --full-restart
 bsodmike: if mysql is using mysql.pid you can do a search using sudo find / -name mysql.pid
 bsodmike: I forget what happens when you try to access mysql?, too many back scrolls lol
 excelsior: download the app called deja backup, and backup your home folder to an external drive, then do the upgraded, then you can restore your back
 I did my home folder backup, then upgraded to 11.04 then restored my home folder, and I got all my docs, images, etc etc back, as well as my firefox settings
 VMware is available free at the VMware site
 VMware player 3
 ikona, yes, I use vmware player it works great,,, Vbox doesn't have all the features that vmware player does
 oops, dusf: sorry, wrong address lol,,,,, yes I would reccomend Vmware player, as Vbox does not have the features that Vmware player has
 gotta go, band practice,,, catch y'all laters
 yeah, the launcher/sidebar only allows single instances, and there's no taskbar that's relied upon by progs such as cryptkeeper
 ok, I have Xchat open right now, but if I click on the Xchat in the launcher, another instance does NOT happen
 nope, dragging the icon from the launcher, to the workspace only puts it back in the launcher, tried it with different icons
 Natty?
 stix: run the app 'Login Screen' in system settings -> system and select 'classic' in the session drop down, then restart pc
 To remind everyone, there is a bug in Natty seahorse that prevents uploading an SSH key to remote server, it has been reported
 andeeeuk don't know what he's let himself in for lol, unity?, yeah right!, I use gnome classic and always will :)
 well, if Ubuntu completely removes gnome, then it's time to move to either Mint, OpenSuse, or one of the others
 Reboot, try installing Ubuntu with wubi
 ReBoot: you could try installing Ubuntu inside a virtual machine to try it out, using free VMware player
 ojii: right click the app title bar
 mmm, I just tried it on Xchat title bar, and I have a selection of move to another workspace, and has a choice of 2,3,4
 ojii: if the app is full screen, then click the 3rd icon on the left of the title bar to come off full screen, then you should be able to right click the apps title bar
 ojii: on the left of the title bar you have a red x, a minus and a squarre,,, click the square to come out of full screen
 ojii, I just tried the drag method it works, but only if the app is windowed
 ojii, click on the workspace switcher, then drag the windowed app across to a workspace,, it works for me that way too
 glad I could help
 ojii: you can also use the same method for full screen apps too
 ojii: yw
 If anyone is interested and wants to auto hide the unity side bar, this site explains how:- http://maketecheasier.com/autohide-unity-launcher-in-ubuntu-natty/2011/04/20
 Fahmida: firfox stores video and temp files in it's own cache folder located at /home/user/.mozilla/firefox/<a bunch of random letters.default>/Cache
 Fahmida: check them all
 ActionParsnip: that link is not firefox specific, and assumes all browsers store their temp files in /tmp, but FF doesn't
 Fahmida: if you know the name of the video, you could try using a terminal and type sudo find / -name <video name>
 vak: open Eclipse and in the launcher, right click Eclipse and check the option 'Keep in Launcher"
 vak: open your apps icon in the launcher, find Eclipse and drag the icon to the launcher
 vak: not sure of that one, but I tried the drag method, and the icon stays in the launcher after loggoff/logon
 Fahmida: click on the circle above the launcher and click on 'Find Files' icon
 maxillusionist: I prefer to use the free VMware player it has a lot more features than vbox
 when I use VMware player, I have played a windows 3D game (need for speed) with no problems
 VMware player can create a VM, one doesn't need the workstation
 or, there is a DOS utility that can be run from a pen drive, called MBRtools
 morgan: if you're using unity, there is no actually system/task bar that is needed by most apps, I often use cryptkeeper, but running it, does not show it anywhere, but in ubuntu classic, it is shown in the system tray
