 Could someone please explain to me how the ubuntu windows installer works? Does it install ubuntu on the same partition as windows? And does it run ubuntu like a program?
 escott: Yeah
 ChronicSyncope: So if I boot into Ubuntu, Windows will not be loaded, correct?
 ChronicSyncope: Thank you
 escott: Lenovo ideapads come with like 4 partitions already, so I cannot create another to install ubuntu to dual boot
 escott: (And I need windows to run my university's exam software; no emulators allowed)
 escott: What is virtual box?
 But would that force me to run two OSs?
 OK, this is what I want: to have a dual boot machine that has windows 7 starter and ubuntu netbook remix
 However, the crappy ideapad s10-3 comes with so many partitions that I am unable to create another one (is 4 the max?).
 ChronicSyncope: Am I allowed to have as many of those as I want?
 ChronicSyncope: OK, thnaks
 Does anyone have a working link to 11.04 netbook version?

 Is there any way to increase the performance of ubuntu? For some reason it is running slower than my windows :? (I installed it on the same partition.)
 Also, how can I access my windows folders whilst in ubuntu?
 KNUBBIG: Where though?
 KNUBBIG: Wait, and I might be on the same complicated disc--I'm not sure... I installed it on the same partition..
 osse: Yes.
 Oh and I found them in
 'Computer'
 osse: I do; thank you. Also, is there a way to increase the performance (speed)? Like, can I change effects or anything?
 Seems to be much slower than 10.10
 osse: Thank you
 osse: Only see Theme, Background, Fonts
 osse: No, but this is pretty bad... (I've had other versions on this computer). Also, there are some problems with clicking "OK" and "yes" and "No" in diaglog boxes
 Ughh
 osse: No
 osse: It's that lenovo doesn't know how to make computers very well, came shippsed with the maximum number of partitions all already used.
 osse: OK, thank

 Has there been problems with left-clicking in 11.04? (I'm having this problem)
 rgr: Is there some place I can go to find updates about it?
 ohsix: Everything; in Mines (game), options on Transmission, closing tabs in Chrome... It's not with a mouse, it's with my touchpad.
 ohsix: How did you fix yours? (Also, do you have a lenovo?)
 ohsix: Uhhh...haha OK, I'm not following I guess; seems like there is no easy solution for me then
 What is the default font in Libreoffice called?
