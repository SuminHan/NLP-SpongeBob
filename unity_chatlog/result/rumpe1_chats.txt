 kellnola, now compiz, somewhere in the far future wayland...
 Dominater: not much
 Macer, well... you just have to script, that if nfs is available, it should be mounted on top of /home/user
 Macer, sure it's possible ... write a scripte like " loop ( if nfs available : mount on top of /home/nfsuser ;  if nfs unavailable : unmount it)" ... or something like that
  digirak, usually not
 POVaddct, xorg
 cucujoidea, it's much easier to just boot from it
 nyquist333, if you want to be sure: just backup your compiz-config (located in $HOME/.compiz)
 mintux, which problem exactly? (check your log files)
 andromeda, no, just update
 johanhar, ps x
 Crazy1, /msg alis list *regex*   (if you plan to search for channels in the future)
 Sledge, already installed flashplugin-nonfree?
 Sledge, usually reboots are only necessary after deep system updates... i would recommend you try it with google chrome, which has a own flash builtin
 Sledge, ok. Next step i would recommend is starting browser by terminal and check for error-messages / warnings
 Sledge, otherwise... well... maybe delete flash-profile? ($HOME/.adobe/...) reinstall flashplugin?
 Sledge, doesn't sound like a relevant error
 Sledge, which ubuntu btw? 64bit?
 Sledge, ati-card?
 Sledge, uname -a , lsb_release -a
 Sledge, yes... but still. Try to reinstall and / or move/delete .adobe-profile directory
 Sledge, if this doesn't work i'm also clueless :/  ... flash is a mess
 Sledge, flash-player-config-directory in your home... or just move it somewhere else
 Guest22043, install maverick
 Guest22043, there is no downgrade-option
 Guest22043, nope... except you use some fancy filesystem, which i doubt
 Guest22043, all your files are usually in /home... back it up.
 !Backup | Guest22043
 Guest22043, and you really shouldnt change anything on your system without backup.. except your data is worthless
 sam_00393948, upgrade is never "safe"
 sam_00393948, usually upgrading should work... but you can never be sure. That's something you have to decide.
 sam_00393948, i recommend a fresh install via usb-stick
 a-saint, wget
 takamoron, it's still using xorg.conf... if it's there.
 noes1s, why not just disable autoconnect for the networks via the gui?
 noes1s, well.. you could try a "grep -R <nameofanaccesspoint> /home/username"  to look for config-files containing the name of the accesspoint
 Promille, bugs yes (it's a brandnew release), data loss no...
 angawar, you also have to adapt the system to the new drive besides the pure cloning (fstab-entries, bootloader)
 Superstar, first thought:  dmesg | grep UDMA
 !daemon
 jbwiv_, check "dmesg"
 Tuplad, if you don't use it, it won't slow your pc down
 iggyology, or shorter: fir[TAB]
 iggyology, you will never need a panel or widgets ever again ;)
 !fuse
 ablaze, nothing is fine. But if it bothers you, you could also write "noquiet nosplash" ... i guess...
 jacktheripper, gnome3 is experimental, there are warnings all over the project page... i hope you have a backup.
 jacktheripper, it's not officially released as a desktop for ubuntu.
 jacktheripper, thats the reason, why you had to add a ppa to the sources
 ezl, use "rename"
 ezl, you know that ubuntu itself doesn't use extensions?
 ezl, maybe this helps you in the future: http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/matching/rename/cmVuYW1l/sort-by-votes
 l3, autoremove doesn't deinstall anything
 l3, erm... wait...
 l3, man apt-get : "autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically  installed to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no more needed."
 l3, uh... why would you do that? :)
