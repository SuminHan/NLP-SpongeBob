 i have a machine that when I ssh into it and log in, it doesn't return me to the shell's prompt
 just sits there... All I did was add ipv6.disable=1 to my kernel line and rebooted?
 any ideas?
 anyone know if there is an in.tftpd option to turn off strictness regarding absolute filenames in requests?
 don't see it in the manpage
 in.tftpd[1607]: RRQ from 172.16.2.230 filename pxelinux.0
 in.tftpd[1607]: sending NAK (2, Only absolute filenames allowed) to 172.16.2.230
 no
 you can't do it
 Jessica903: pxe is for wired lan
 heh i forgot about gpxe
 however, there are only two families of wlan cards supported
 Jessica903: that can be done
 i'd imagine you'll need an initrd though
 where you'll load your wlan drivers
 you will just want to create an initrd (squashfs) that includes your wlan drivers
 I would just modofy en existing bootable setup
 the bootstrap will load the initrd which will in turn load your wlan, run a script to connect to your wifi, and then begin whetever else it is you're wanting to accomplish
 if you're just wanting to have a diskless boot
 then you should just load the system via nfs or tftp
 no, this is not for beginners
 or even intermediates ;)
 i suggest reading all you can about doing it with a LAN adapter
 then apply the differences
 there is stuff available that is pretty easily slapped together
 to do this via LAN
