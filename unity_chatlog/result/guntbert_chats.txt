 |Seth|: what is the problem?
 golona:  Do you have an ubuntu support question?
 |Seth|: never seen before ... did you upgrade from 10.10?
 |Seth|: as I said, never seen - but it looks like the upgrade didn't run through completely
 |Seth|: no, it *should* work with any (recent) live CD  (but there *should* be no error either :-))
 |Seth|: was just reading it - I don't see any reason why it would not work with your 10.10 CD
 |Seth|: Good luck :-)

 FoolsRun: 10.04 -> 10.10 -> 11.04
 !guidelines | bashelina
 bashelina: are you talking about natty?
 bashelina: then I cannot help, sorry (only 10.10 here)
 bashelina: but in my latest natty VM I had german locale and english language without any problem
 profundo: I guess the servers are under heavy load right now, how about you wait a few days?
 W43372: this will only work if the CD image has a special structure
 Macer: no
 !upgrade | Macer
 W43372: it usually only works with ubuntu (maybe debian) CD images, there must be a certain directory structure
 W43372: yes, and fedora CDs might have a different structure of directories, so creating a usb-drive with startup-creator won#t work
 Macer: you're welcome :-)
 W43372: well, try with unetbootin
 OchoZero9: how about you wait a day or two?

 sre-su: you question was not clear for me - what di you want to do?
 sre-su: understood, glad you found it
 z0mbyk1d: but you *must* not jump over releases
 z0mbyk1d: what you *can* or *can't* is not the question - what it does to your system makes the difference :)
 phibxr: because natty is released
 !trash | makaveli0129
 makaveli0129: it seems they move it around a little :-))
 makaveli0129: I suggest you first look what is there: ls -l ~/.local/share/Trash  (no $ !)
 makaveli0129: and then your command (without $) will be fine
 !enter | Cream2011
 !pastebin | makaveli0129
 makaveli0129: ah there are folders, so ls -lR ~/.local/share/Trash
 !pt | work
 !tab | makaveli0129
 makaveli0129: and, are you satisfied with the result?
 pumeust: type mount and look at the output
 pumeust: if it you just want to check the file system:  The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check
 pumeust: best begin by telling what your problem is :)
 pumeust: in that case it is best you do everything after booting from a live CD
 pumeust: if the disc does not carry part of the actual system (like in forensic examinations) then you can do it from a running system too - step 1) unmount it with   sudo umount  <mount-point>
 pumeust: you're welcome :-)  ... and Good luck :-)

 jdl: did you see http://onthefencedevelopment.com/?p=455 ?
 Sacko: I've heard this once or twice in the past - never saw a satisfying answer what was the cause ...
 Sacko: I was talking about here :-),  still step1) did you md5sum check the iso before burning it?
 !md5sum | Sacko sure
 Sacko: I didn't say it *is* the issue, just to start digging somewhere, and the you can "check the integrity" of the burnt CD from the start menu too
 Sacko: Good luck :-)
 chrome_: only when the file system is not mounted
 chrome_: then boot a live CD image (I guess it is a vbox guest)
 chrome_: you can simply use GParted for that task
 !ot | Rehan Blue_Opal
 jahrome_: how should we know? In what way is it slow?
 jahrome_: are you talking about slow network? what kind of network? wlan?
 jahrome_: atheros? I haven't heard about any problems yet
 jahrome_: please ask the channel again, my own experience with natty is rather limited, but mention wifi slowness and atheros from the beginning

 sary:  Please give at least an overview of your problem *here* (all in one line) - you will get a much greater audience.
 sary: sorry, no idea here - do you say you cannot post to any forums using any browser? but everything else on the web works just fine?
 sary: are you behind a proxy?
 sary: try it with a text based browser (like elinks)
 scottlad: don't advertise
 sary: and did it work?
 sary: I want to make sure if it might be a problem with gnome settings, a transparent proxy,....   - but I'm out for tonight  - Good luck :-)
