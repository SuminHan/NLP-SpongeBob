 After upgrading to 11.04, I have run into several issues.. first one was that the / would not mount and could not start the computer... now that Ive solved it, I am logged in but my gnome panel is gone.. and windows has no frame with X,...
 blackbit: no window frame where the x (to close the window is ) ... also the gnome panel menus are gone
 but those I have been able to start by running gnome-panel from console
 ActionParsnip: thanks...
 will I have to do that everytime I start the computer ?
 ActionParsnip: yes..
 blackbit: yes.. but the problem with an approach like that I usually all the config files in various places will eb lost ... it is never that simple ..
