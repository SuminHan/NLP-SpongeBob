 I auto upgraded to 11.04 today and the install has stalled out with: restarting services have possibly affected the upgrade: restarting spam assassin done, restarting cups...   then nothing
 anyone have any idea why the upgrade to Natty has stalled for hours now with :  restarting services have possibly affected the upgrade: restarting spam assassin done, restarting cups...   then nothing?

 Incarus6 yes
 ok
 Incarus6 cups is stopped now
 I think it might be  :D
 Incarus6 I got this: Since the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an
 Upstart job, you may also use the stop(8) and then start(8) utilities,
 e.g. stop cups ; start cups. The restart(8) utility is also available.
 Incarus6 thank YOU so much it looks like the upgrade is now going thru!!!   :D
