 11.04 is lame
 how the heck do i get a "pager" with unity
 i want my multi desktops
 Pici: ?
 Pici: is ther a wa to get the best of both worlds?
 or is unity doomed to fail?
 jibadeeha: not without a simple pager
 jibadeeha: and why did they take away normal panels
 jibadeeha: this is absolutely retarded.
 jibadeeha: window maker is better
 jibadeeha: why
 jibadeeha: that is totally irrelevent.
 windows xp was a minor change on a proven user interface.
 unity is a whole new user interface
 jibadeeha: whatever, the winxp interface is win95's interface
 jibadeeha: you know it, i know it, we allk now it. and it's also totally unimportant because MS had the power to shove things down people's throats, ubuntu does not.
 jibadeeha: it is too.
 jibadeeha: start menu, desktop. basics. it's all there.
 jibadeeha: who decided to go the unity route?
 i want to talk to them.
 so how does the pager work in "unity" ?
 i can move things to other work spaces, but i don't know how to switch work spaces
 uabn93: some people recommend ati, they are jerks.
 uabn93: for linux, nvidia is the only good solution (with closed source drivers)
 uabn93: the open source drivers just aren't there yet.
 Casper76: i have it on two p4's right now, i agree, it is slower.
 Casper76: disable all the eye candy and it's "bearable"
 uabn93: i have that setup right now, works great
 uabn93: six cores amd process + nvidia viid card. it's great :)
 Casper76: i think we're asking too much of our p4's :)
 uabn93: nvidia gts 250
 so how do we change workspaces in unity!?
 jibadeeha: doesn't exist
 but i found the kb short cut ctrl-alt-right and ctrl-alt-left
 jibadeeha: where is this mysterious icon?
 jibadeeha: bottom of what
 jibadeeha: ok, now i see it
 jibadeeha: this is retarded.
 jibadeeha: it's not even on the screen all the time, it doesn't have a preview
 jibadeeha: my biggest problem with this new interface is you can't just browse all the apps
 jibadeeha: why did they take away the fold out menu!?
 jibadeeha: yes, that's how i like to work too.
 jibadeeha: menu is only useful when you want to "browse"
 jibadeeha: and now it's gone!
 jibadeeha: well it was better than what we have now.
 this is unusable
 oh well
 ChR0n05: you also feel this is a terrible move?
 ChR0n05: to me, it's even worse than when kde went to kde 4.x from 3.5.10
 and that was seriously bad!
 jibadeeha: kde 4.x is getting there again.. but i'm starting to doubt it will actually make it there.
