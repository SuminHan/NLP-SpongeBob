 anyone have an estimate of what time it'll be out?
 necrotik:  you've checked volume and mute settings on both TV and computer?
 ok.  what sort of hdmi cable are you using?
 hdmi on both ends?  one cable all the way through, or is there a connector in the middle?
 which hdmi port on the tv are you using?  some tvs don't have sound support on all hdmi connections.  don't ask me why, it gave me trouble when I used to install DirecTV for people
 also, that said, are you using nvidia-current?
 necrotik:  the only other thing I can suggest at this point is driver-related.  are you using nvidia-current, and have you checked the NVidia settings?
 necrotik:  assuming you're still in 10.04 or 10.10 and gnome, it's in the System/Administration menu, as 'NVidia X Server Settings'
 necrotik:  someone else might be able to better help you, then
 necrotik:  I just found this via google, it may help:  http://theironlion.net/blog/2010/09/20/ubuntu-lucid-nvidia-and-hdmi-sound/
 if we torrent the cd, will the upgrade tool automatically install from the cd?
 will the distribution upgrade tool automatically install from the cd if I have it in the drive?
 if I have a natty cd in the drive, will the distribution upgrade tool automatically use it to install the upgrade or is there a procedure I need to follow?
 how do I do a distribution upgrade using a cd?
 ok, so I grabbed the wrong torrent, then
 true :)
 why is it, that even though I told it *not* to get updates from online while using the alternate iso, it's still downloading files?
 Natty upgrade complete.  so....how do I configure this sidebar thing?
 stefg:  options are a requirement for me to use something.  lack of options = stress, annoyance, irritation, and frustration :P
 bittyx-laptop:  yeah, on the login screen
 ooh, I *can* configure the sidebar!
 hmm.  xchat no longer shows in the system tray despite having the option set
 ok.  minimizing to the system tray does *not* work in Unity
 if you try to minimize a program (such as xchat, for example) it vanishes completely.  the only way to get it back is to open another instance of the program, and kill the inaccessible process from the system monitor
 minimize to system tray, I mean
 what's the "super key"?
 ahh, ok
 Soothsayer:  no.  MAC address is hardcoded into the network card
 Soothsayer:  sounds like your ISP has problems and you need to complain to them.  but MAC addresses need to be unique even moreso than IP addresses
 ok.  this is ticking me off.  is there a way to revert to a previous version without completely reinstalling?
 Monotoko:  no, I'm in gnome.  certain programs I use on a daily basis are now crashing every time I switch window focus
 upgrade
 Monotoko:  the program I'm having trouble with isn't installed system-wide, it's in my home directory
 oh great.  it doesn't crash in unity....but every time I switch window focus away from it in gnome it crashes
 how do I get to growl in unity?
 wth?
 how do I access growl?
 can anyone tell me how to get growl notifications in natty?
