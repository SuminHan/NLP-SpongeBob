 I need help; Natty broke my computer, it won't even start up!
 I did upgrade from 10.10. I restarted, and it said Unity wasn't supported, so I went with GNOME. Then I restarted again and now it won't start up.
 Is there a way to start up my computer from Command Line? I can get there...
 Upgrade. I have to hit escape to get to the CLI...just the normal CLI, doesn't say grub
 golly, I dont know, but that may be the issue. When I first started it it didnt recognize and forced me to go to gnome
 I think its a NVIDIA??
 What is the grub menu exactly? Command line looking thing with a purple background?
 OK, i gimaged it...I do know what it is!
 And no, I can't get there.
 I'm trying to get back to command line...it's a chancy thing...
