 hi, instaling 11.04. what should i set the mount point as?
 thabks froq. thats what i thought. what does it mean, for future reference?
 should i define a swap partition? i have two hdds, and i plan to boot ubuntu from this one and windows from the other.
 calamari, is it necessary? provided any and all personal data will be on an esata ext hdd.
 calamari, ah, whoops. i have 2gb ram, then
 calamari, so it translates into ram, more or less?
 wel, the hdd is only
 20 gb, but i guess ill specify another two gigs or so.
 well, ud imagine that i can do it from gparted on a live cd later anyways.
 so i'll leave it as is for now.
