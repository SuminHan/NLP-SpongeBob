 Is there a way I upgrade Ubuntu 10.04 to 11.04 using a CD?
 The computer that I am intending to upgrade does not have a fast Internet connection
 That is why I need to grab Ubuntu 11.04 ona difference computer and then put it on this one
 I have another issue with my Ubuntu 10.10
 When I start Remote Desktop Viewer and when it is about to connect to remote host, the screen logs out
 and comes to the login screen
 Why does Ubuntu log me out frequently when I start remote desktop?
