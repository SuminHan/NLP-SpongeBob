 What's the support like in Ubuntu for cheap inkjet printers?  There are some cheap printers available and I'm thinking of getting one for Ubuntu
 velcroshooz: well the deskjet 3050 is $48 at Officeworks
 velcroshooz: you reckon the HP 3050 will be supported?
 velcroshooz: I want to print source code with colour coding from gedit
 jrib: thanks, I'm looking through the online stuff and it seems hit and miss
 jrib: No I'm not near there
 Does anyone here wish to make a recommendation about a cheap inkjet printer that has at least 3 colours plus black that works well with Ubuntu?
 jaredquinn: Well Officeworks is selling a couple of cheap HPs but I can't find them on the hardware lists
 HP Deskjet 3050 jaredquinn
 jaredquinn: and deskjet 2000
 jaredquinn: are you looking something up?
 jaredquinn: yes
 jaredquinn: well that's all very well for Windows but what about Ubuntu?
 jaredquinn: I reckon I'll just ask periodically here to see what people are experiencing.  I can't seem to find up to date info online
 Hi everyone.  My Ubuntu can't seem to access the repos.  Is that because of overuse?
 nameless`: That won't complete
 nameless`: It's saying "Downloaded 0B of 1B"
 it's ridiculous
 anyway I suppose I can live with a couple of days of no repo
 ok
 So what's the verdict on 11.04?
 I'm a bit unsure about Unity
 is it as simple as just selecting not to use it?
 buff27: is it as simple as that?
 AdmV0rl0n: are you a KDE man?
 buff27: I worry that the GNOME environment won't be as well-supported as Ubuntu moves away from it
 buff27: GNOME is not Unity
 So any other opinions about 11.04 out there?
 LALALLAA: October 2011
 What's the gcc/clang on 11.04?
 which version I mean
 nerdshell: that needs to be updated
 11.04 is officially released, the bot needs to be updated
 Pici: good work
 Can anyone with 11.04 type gcc -v and clang -v and tell me what versions of each are installed by default?
 For the record, clang 2.8 and gcc 4.5.2
 Hi gang.  Anyone just downloaded 11.04 and want to express an opinion about it?  What about Unity?
 anyone want to say what they think of 11.04?  What about Unity?
 Anyone here using a Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 2000 with Ubuntu?  I'm thinking of buying one for my Ubuntu box and I want to know if it'll work well
 Okay guys I'm thinking of buying a HP Deskjet 2000 for Ubuntu so I can print out color-coded source code using gedit.Â  Any last thoughts before I plonk the money down?
 Hi everyone.  I'm trying to print on a HP Deskjet from Ubuntu that is virtualized within VBox on Windows 7.  Is this the best channel to try and fix the problem?
 Is anyone here a guru on printing from Ubuntu within VBox?  I have VBox 4.0.6 running Ubuntu 10.10 32-bit.  It's hosted on Windows 7 64-bit.  A Deskjet 2000 is plugged in via USB to the PC.  Windows drivers are installed.  Test printing from Windows works fine.  I have set up a USB filter for the printer and checked it 'on' and Ubuntu appears to know that it exists.  I print from within Ubuntu, and they all appear to complete
 successfully, but nothing actually comes out of the printer.
 teknowill: good
 teknowill: yep
 teknowill: yep
 teknowill: no problem
 teknowill: Well it mounts in one or the other
 teknowill: The USB thing just isn't working.  I'm trying to share over Ethernet
 teknowill: Well the printer is mounted in Windows 7 and tests successfully.  I select it to print over network, and it has a name on the network.  Now I"m in Ubuntu.  How do I get Ubuntu to recognize the printer's there on the network?
 teknowill: ok
 teknowill: it currently works perfectly within Windows 7
 and I'm sharing it from Windows 7 on the network teknowill
 teknowill: no printer shares found.  It says I should check my firewall configuration but I don't have Firewall under System->Administration
 teknowill: How do I set the VBox newtwork to bridge?
 teknowill: I'm about ready to install Ubuntu as dual-boot instead of virtualized
 teknowill: I have changed it from NAT to Bridged Adapter.  Is that what I need?
 teknowill: And for Name, do I select the real NIC or the VirtualBox Host-Only thing?
 teknowill: okay I selected the real adapter and now my SMB Browser sees Workgroup and Richard-Windows, which I presume is something from the Windows 7 machine appearing in Ubuntu
 teknowill: I figured out what the problem is, and I'll tell you
 teknowill: I originally had no password for my Windows 7 user account.  But Ubuntu won't log onto the workgroup without a password.  You must have a password or it won't log into the workgroup.
 teknowill: It's looking better but same thing is happening.  I've printed a test page twice, and both times Ubuntu claims it was successful but nothing has come out of my printer
 teknowill: I reckon I'll install Natty as a dual-boot and stop all this virtualization rubbish.  It causes more problems than it solves.
 teknowill: in theory, yes
 teknowill: Well the printer is right there on the printing configuration page.  It appears to know that the printer exists.  But nothing comes out of the printer.
 teknowill: that's more trouble than it's worth
 teknowill: Honestly I reckon I'll install Linux on the metal.  VBox has caused me nothing but trouble and it doesn't do me much good
 Okay, everyone.  I love Ubuntu 10.10 and I haven't yet upgraded to 11.04.  I'm a bit dubious about Unity though.  Should I stick with 10.10, learn to live with Unity, run 11.04 with GNOME, or switch to another distro?
 teknowill: yeah
 teknowill: I might try that
 teknowill: mate I'm fed up and I'm looking for a distro to install on the metal
 teknowill: problem is that if Ubuntu stays with this Unity crap, I reckon I might abandon Ubuntu
 teknowill: No, I want GNOME
 teknowill: Well Debian doesn't have GNOME 3.  I think I prefer debian-based distros
 taglass: no wait I meant GNOME 2
 my bad
 teknowill: yeah you can login using GNOME.  My only concern is that ubuntu will move away from GNOME
 I wish there were a perfect Linux distro so I don't have to choose
 teknowill: Yeah there's a fear of the unknown for me too
 teknowill: I can't even get 10.10 from the ubuntu website!
 teknowill: it gives me 11.04 or 10.04
 teknowill: I don't care about office or rhythmbox
 I'm coding
 teknowill: I mean I'm using gcc, clang, nano, make.  So arguably I don't need the latest version of anything
 teknowill: No, I'm downloading 10.04
 teknowill: As I said I don't need the bleeding edge version of anything, so it's about familiarity and avoiding Unity
 teknowill: Anyway thanks for trying to help me.  You're a good sport.
 So where do I get help for 10.04?  Is that here also?
 Logan_: Yes but is this the right channel for help with it?
 Logan_: 3 years for the desktop
 Logan_: Well I'm about to install it baby
 Logan_: yep
 narf_: Are you talking about Unity?
 Imagine if all the Linux developers spent all their time working on the one distro?  All that effort put into one distro, Linux would really be something
 The one thing I didn't like about debian was hte icons
 So here's a thought: Why does the distro fit exactly on one CD?  Does the base install consist of packages that will fit on one CD?  Would Ubuntu ever distribute a release that needed compulsory download or burning to DVD?
 red2kic: so are all releases limited by that size?
 red2kic: well what about using DVD?
 red2kic: Or USB key would be possible too
 See in future we could say that the release is limited to 4 gigs compressed
 linuxuz3r: you can have a release party of your own
 Okay, I have an nvidia GTX460SE card running on Ubuntu 10.04.  The screen is in 640x480 mode and obviously isn't being accelerated.  How do I get decent drivers for it?  The nvidia website wants me to download a 26 megabyte .bin file and I don't know what to do with it
 fubada: thx
 fubada: I have the proprietary drivers installed but it still seems to be using VGA crappy settings
 Hi everyone.  I've connected an HP Deskjet 2000 to Ubuntu via USB.  Ubuntu isn't virtualized, it's running on the metal now.  I print a test page and Ubuntu thinks it's completed but nothing comes out of the printer.  What do I do?  Are there proprietary drivers that I should use?
 Hi everyone.  My HP Deskjet 2000 works in Windows 7 and OS X perfectly.  But I can't get it to work on Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit.  Ubuntu thinks that it's printing, and the powerlight flashes as though the printer's thinking, but no output comes out.  Any ideas?
 beekor: even though it doesn't under OS X/Windows?
 okay... I'll test it again and give it a few minutes
 beekor: about my printing problems - I just tested it again.  When I send the thing to the printer, the power button goes fully bright like it just woke up.  It doesn't flash.  It's not printing.  But Ubuntu says "Idle - Finished page 1".  Any ideas?
 beekor: USB
 beekor: Is there some driver other than the default CUPS driver that comes with Ubuntu?  It's a HP Deskjet 2000.  Yes it detects as the right model
 beekor: mate just FYI http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1742745
 you know, one day, Soothsayer, computers will just work
 You don't need to know anything about mechanics to be able to drive a car
 anyone got a deskjet working on Ubuntu?  I'm on Ubuntu 10.04 with a Deskjet 2000 plugged in via USB.  I can print from OS X and from Windows 7 on the exact same machine but Ubuntu doesn't want to print.  It acts as though it does print successfully but nothing comes out of the printer.  Any ideas?
 Quick poll: What do you think of Unity?  Thumbs up or down?
 Is it too early for me to ask what the stance is on Unity/GNOME in 11.10?
 ChronicSyncope: Well, I'm asking what's happening.  I like GNOME and I don't like Unity
 ChronicSyncope: yeah but it might not be there
 yeah ChronicSyncope I'm with 10.04 right now because of that
 PythonPup: that's interesting, but it's hardly a definitive statement on the matter
 PythonPup: Oops, I didn't check the author's name
 PythonPup: okay, I think you're right
 This Unity business will ruin Ubuntu
 PythonPup: Seriously, Ubuntu has been the most popular distro for years now.  With this Unity business, it's finished
 I reckon I'll stay with Ubuntu 10.04 until it becomes too old, and then upgrade to debian with GNOME
 PythonPup: I'll stay with 10.04.  I'm doing coding mainly so it's not like I need a recent release
 Who's using GNOME 3?  Why can't Ubuntu use GNOME 3?  GNOME 3 looks good to me
 freeman_: I used to do it in a VM too, only issue was I couldn't get the printer to work from the VM
 Another issue - has anyone played SuperTux from ubuntu and got the sound to work?  I can't get sound to work in Supertux
 PythonPup: the current version of Fedora?
 PythonPup: Okay, good.  I'm running Fedora 14 and it has GNOME 2.  I don't like the Fedora look and feel as much as Ubuntu
 PythonPup: But if Ubuntu continues to move toward unity and away from GNOME, I'm going to Fedora or Debian
 PythonPup: I'm coding a Wikipedia bot so I want to only use release software
 PythonPup: I can't run my code on beta anything
 Alright, let me start a debate: Is it true that 10.04 is less likely to have bugs, or have fewer bugs, than 11.04?  Or is the benefit really that one does not need to upgrade/relearn things/upgrade hardware/etc?
 It seems to me that no release is every truly stable.  There are always bugfixes and new releases etc
 red2kic: I went from 9.04 to 10.10 and I went back to 10.04 rather than use 11.04 because I like GNOME
 ok I'm going to offtopic channel
 I'm not getting any sound on SuperTux on 10.04.  I have no problem getting sound from Ubuntu normally.  Any ideas?
 Incarus6: I can't seem to install aoss
 I says install alsa-oss but when I try it doesn't work
 Incarus6: I typed aoss supertux and it started supertux but still no sound
 what filesystem does 11.04 use by default?  ext3 or ext4?
 And same question for 10.04
 What's the status of the ARM port?  Is it going to become an official architecture?
 happolati: sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
 Does anyone know.. is ARM going to become an official Ubuntu architecture?
 I have a KWorld TV tuner that works perfectly in Windows 7.  I am running Ubuntu 10.04 on the exact same computer (on the metal, not virtualized).  Can I use my tuner?  How do I even tell if it's recognized?  It's connected to a USB port
 VanDyke: I have Novatek and Afatech.  Do they sound like TV tuners?  There's also a mouse, which I recognize
 VanDyke: google seems to indicate that Afatech is the chipset in the tuner
 sdollins: I hear you bro
 ok
 Starminn: give over, it's not deprecated
 it's the most popular Linux GUI
 is it in a PPA or something?
 Starminn: GNOME 3
 for Ubuntu 10.04 or 11.04
 DocPlatypus: honestly, my next distro will be debian or Fedora
 sdollins: and yes, I'm sure the GNOME fanboys will come up with a GNOME Ubuntu
 Since installing 10.04 I've been pleasantly surprised at the lack of daily updates
 nted?
 what's that
 sdollins: I think the choice of GUI can change your feel for the system.  I hate KDE, love GNOME
 Starminn: they won't be the largest distro if people hate Unity
 Starminn: I remember when Red Hat was the most popular.  Then they went commercial...
 Why are you posting foreign language channels here?
 ASEDDDD: depends on personal preference
 ASEDDDD: I like GNOME 2 as well.  I'll prefer GNOME 3 when it's ready for prime time
 I find that in 10.04 I have the su command and none of my passwords work with it.  1) Is su officially supported now?  2)  Why don't my passwords work?
 zvacet: yes I know but my questions still stand
 KrisDouglas: PAE kernel is default, isn't it?
 Dr_Willis: cirkey
 crikey*
 How do I know how much RAM it's using?
 nanomad: Looks like I have 3.5 gigs
 when my puter has 4 gigs installed
 blimey
 you'd think PAE would be enabled by default
 nanomad: Yeah 32 bit OS on a 64 bit CPU
 nanomad: discrete nvidia
 See, the ubuntu website says you should use the 32-bit version.  If PAE is not enabled by default, I think 64 bits should be pushed harder.  Plenty of people have 4 gigs now
 I think it's normal too.  Windows 7 does the same thing
 It claims here that PAE is installed by default on 10.04: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnablingPAE
 I would think that plenty of people now have 4 gigs or more of RAM
 Does anyone know if 11.04 also installs the PAE kernel if it detects over 3 gig of RAM?
 zvacet: next question : does your uname -a output include the letters pae?
 zvacet: I installed 10.04 on my puter with 4 Gig RAM and I don't have the PAE thing installed.  I'm not sure whose fault that is
 I bloody knew I should have installed the 64-bit version
 zvacet: well at least I can download the PAE kernel.  31 megs, here we go
 zvacet: rebooting now, hang on
 damn it, I shouldn't have to do this manually.  Ubuntu should do it automatically
 Now the PAE kernel won't work with my nvidia drivers
 nanomad: So what do I do?  Run in text mode?
 zvacet: does that mean I have to do remove and install?
 Dr_Willis: sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
 I just did that again and it says they're already installed
 I'll remove and reinstall.  Hang on.
 nanomad: Homey don't play that
 rafii: stand by, I'm trying to fix this
 olskolirc: yes
 Okay, nvidia drivers for my GTX 460 SE do not work with PAE kernel.  Full stop.
 nanomad: On boot up I get a screen saying drivers gave an error
 nanomad: why are you saying that?
 ok
 Okay, I just cannot get nvidia drivers working with PAE kernel
 I wish there were an option to upgrade from 32-bit to 64-bit distro
 sipior: Yeah I guess so
 Well if I want to use all 4 gigs of RAM I have to
 Good morning, gang
