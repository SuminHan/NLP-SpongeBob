 i'll keep classic gnome, but should i upgrade to 11.04 or do the fresh install. are there bugs with upgrading from 10.10?
 is there a good way to install apps via script via apt-get or synaptic or aptitude, but still get the icons in gnome panel?
 how can i tell if i installed the beta vs the release version of 11.04?  when i do a "about unbuntu" does the beta display "beta"?
 whats the diff between installing a package with apt-get, aptitude, synaptic? which one will install icons in gnome besides ubuntu software center
 i want to script installing all the packages i use, for stuff like example... 11.04
 i dont think apt-get installs icons
 where is the config for the gnome panel layout stored?  i want to copy it from 10.10 to 11.04 gnome, after running a script to install all my apps
 man that sucks, unity (and gnome 3) seem so restricting
 is there a way to install a package, say with apt-get, or synaptic, or aptitude but also have it add an icon to the gnome app panel?
 even apt-get, ok, i see, so its the apps fault, thanks
 if i install kubuntu on my 10.10 gome, how can i go back to gnome if i need to
 will it have a choice at the login screen, or more complicated than that
 vega: cool thanks!
 i think i may try 11.04 in a month with gnome classic, then when 11.10 comes around not sure maybe go to kde, or other distro
