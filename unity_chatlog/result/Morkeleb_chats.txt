 i intsalled ubuntu 11.4 and tried to install other languages, but none are found. it cannot connect to us.archive.ubuntu.com - so i changed the update server by detecting the best one. now i cannot select any laguange at all (none are listed anymore)
 how to fix this?
 strange language install works now after updating server and restaring language support (it checked for languages again)
