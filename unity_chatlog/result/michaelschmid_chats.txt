 hi! just updated from 10.10 to 11.04... during install i had a crash. then i finished using shell. now my install is sometimes freezing and nautilus doesn't work anymore (just doesn't start). any suggestions?
 sure?
 yeah, i understood... but any ideas how to get nautilus running again and then installing some days later?
 how can i find out, at what job the upgrade crashed?
 ziber, i think i had the same problem
 first it was extremely slow, now it works, but sometimes it is freezing. try first to start the classic version (gnome)
 ziber, but i don't really have a solutino
 ziber, try to login using gnome (classic)
 ziber, did upgrade to through without crash/error?
 ziber, click onto your user and then at the bottom you can choose
 how to force nautilus reinstall? (on shell)
 escott, thanks!
 is 11.04 LTS?
 hmmm.... nautilus won't start after reinstall.... any suggestions? :-)
 ceninan, i had the same (or quite similar)... after trying a bit i found out, that it worked with classic view... but now my installation is boggous and natulis won't work
 on login
 you use gnome instead of unity
 ceninan, you don't even have login?
 :-(
 maybe you can do something over ssh? from another machine?
