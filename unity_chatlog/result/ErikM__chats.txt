 hello everybody
 does any one know any workaround for the nvidia driver issue being installed but not in use? :)
 Stereocaulon: jepp... 173 installed and not in use, even if I switch to the newest one... same result
 Stereocaulon:  jepp, after every new install, no effect
 Stereocaulon: GeForce 9500GT
 Stereocaulon: applications > system > additional drivers > there are 2 driver versions - 173 and version current), klicking of the one NOT activated starts the install, after installing andd verifying it being installed and activated I reboot as prompted
 Stereocaulon: brings up the nvidia X server settings
 Stereocaulon: 173.14.30 but if it is in use, why is the system so damn slow? :)
 Stereocaulon: you are on 11.04 and the driver is working properly on your side?
 Stereocaulon: oh, looks like I am not the only one : http://askubuntu.com/questions/37084/nvidia-driver-activated-but-currently-not-in-use
 Stereocaulon: ok, I first upgrade from ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04, then because of unity installed Kubuntu on same partition freshly....
 Stereocaulon: back in a minute, restart computer
