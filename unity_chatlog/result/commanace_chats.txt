 Hey everyone, does anyone know how I can tell apt that my package is being managed by another packaging system? Which boils down to: it should mark the package as installed but not actually install it and set a flag such that the package will not be updated if there's a new version in the tree...
 I see that there's a --no-upgrade option, but that does not prevent apt from actually installing the package...
