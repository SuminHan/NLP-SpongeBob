 this the best channel to deal with a server upgraded to natty which won't now go beyond a grub prompt?
 hm
 I've managed to rescue a broken grub menu after upgrading to natty
 however I have no console now
 just a cursor
 I can ssh in
 nothing seems "hung"
 Dr_Willis: interesting
 Dr_Willis: only after hitting alt+f1 do I get a console
 usr13: isn't tty1 supposed to come up by default these days?
 Dr_Willis: this is a headless virtual machine - no X
 I'm looking at a vmware console
 Dr_Willis: just had to rescue it having upgraded from 10.10. This really is not going well
