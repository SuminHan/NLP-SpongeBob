 howdy. Just booted into ubuntu 11.4 aand.. compiz effects are disabled. Trying to eanble the nvidia driver but doesn't seem to be a way
 ChronicSyncope, I'm also trying to get compiz to work
 ChronicSyncope, unity
 ChronicSyncope, when I select additional hardware drivers it shows me that the nvidia driver isn't enabled but also has no way for me to enable it
 ChronicSyncope, yes
 ChronicSyncope, sec
 ChronicSyncope, says "This driver is activated but not currently in use", and the circle is green
 ChronicSyncope, but I don't get my old effects.
 ChronicSyncope, and under "Appearance" there's no option to enable effects
 ChronicSyncope, ok.
 ChronicSyncope, got it thank you.
