 I was trying a cli version upgrade but it failed with a bunch of broken packages. Is there a way to fix it?
 rgr: to 11.04
 google chrome window decorations are broken after ubuntu 11.04 upgrade. Once, I maximize and restore the chrome window it's covered by regular application window border
 how do I install applets for weather or cpu-scaling etc?
 on ubuntu 11.04?
 LjL: thnaks
 LjL: indicator-weather is pulling about 10 other packages!
 LjL: yes
