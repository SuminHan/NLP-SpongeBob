 why has installing gnome3 (on 11.04) given me a horrible theme?
 hypetech: I know, but it's just weird that the theme for gnome-wm has been replaced
 If I install a proprietary driver for my graphics card (ATI/AMD FGLRX) and that results in not being able to boot, what could I then do about it?
 is there a simple way to remove a restricted driver via the rootsheel?
