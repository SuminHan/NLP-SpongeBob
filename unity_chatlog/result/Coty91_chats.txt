 Hey, I just finished installing Natty on my system; however, I've ran into an issue with my dual monitors and ati drivers. In order for me to be able to use my dual monitors I have to have xinerama enabled, but it doesn't support compiz when enabled. So when I try to login I'm sent back to the GDM. Any ideas on how I can fix this, please?
 So does Unity work with dual monitors? I can't get it to work with my ATI 5770 with Xinerama enabled. Clearly, the issue is that xinerama doesn't support compiz, so how do I get dual monitor support with Unity?
 Yea, It did work great with the open source drivers, but as soon as I installed fglrx it no longer works. Problem is I don't know how to remove the ATI drivers since I didn't it manually.
 sgaap: I used the ATI installer
 sgaap: Thanks, I'll give it a shot.
 sgaap: Do you know if there are any upsides to using fglrx opposed to the open source drivers?
 sgaap: Ah, well I use windows for that. Thanks again!
 macrossm: Unity is built on top of GNOME
 I like the idea of Unity but it feels like I'm using a mac; in the sense, that I have little power over changing and customizing the experience now.
 nutsfornatty: I'm really hoping the reason for it is that they had a limit amount of time to build Unity before release.
 cyoz1: Fedora isn't all that great imo. Try Arch it's waay better.
 ohsix: they did it backwards indeed. lol
 FoolsRun: You have to update to 10.10 first
 jrt4: You're up to date as long as you've installed the latest updates.
 jrt4: Correct. It will be just like you installed the final release.
