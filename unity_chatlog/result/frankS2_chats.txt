 When i log in using desktop : ubuntu i only see my desktop, no menus at all
 Hedgehog456: 4GB
 jan_: I already have compiz installed
 Hedgehog456: i even rm -rf .gnome* and .gconf* so it should be clean
 How can I check which package /bin/ls comes from?
 thanks jrib
 jrib: any way I can do that in reverse? Like check all files that comes from the package
 gartral: no, coreutils
