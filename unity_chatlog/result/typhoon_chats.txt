 does any one know anything about knockd and ufw for multiple services?
 can anyone help me with ufw rules please?
 @mknarr thanks, but I have a rather more complicated setup, multiple daemons  multiple ports with different publishing rules required
 @mknarr just need a nudge
 @acicula I need ssh, ssl email ports and smtp, and web 80 available to internet + internal lan. I also need mysql ports only available on internal
 @acicula I'm being a noob. I just open the lot don't I and NAT the rest through my router...
 mello: try changing your session to gnome and setting the defaults in ccsm from there
 rcmaehl: you can, just configure compiz
 rcmaehl: can you be a bit more specific then? what are you trying to achieve?
 rcmaehl, you are going to have to read the manual I'm afraid. You can start by maybe using KDE if you want a "start menu" and a taskbar at the bottom. Or you could move the panels around
 rcmaehl: assuming you have gnome classic?
 rcmaehl: Your day is getting better and better lol. I would roll back to 10.04. I'm not upgrading for a while yet because unity is *cough* unstable :-)
 no unity is like mac
 linux is just the kernel
 skulltip: I was correcting you, not comparing the 2
 samsagax: This is linux not windows :-)
 osmodivs: I know, I still have to hack in some 2d sis drivers for my old laptop. Seems I have had a sense of humour failure or something
 night guys. Good luck with Natty
