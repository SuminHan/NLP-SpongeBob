 can't boot into ubuntu after alternative 11.04 install, hangs after grub, any ideas?
 just bits and pieces i put together, is there a problem with certain hardware atm?
 might download and try desktop install, wandering if its a problem with encryption :/
 wondering
 okies the problem is with encryption with the alternative 64bit 11.04 install, works fine with raid and no encrypted drives :(
 so anybody else trying encrypting all their drives with 11.04?
 hypetech, haven't been able to get full disk encryption working with natty
 hangs after grub
 imo theres nothing wrong with total hdd encryption at all
 ohsix, how do you figure that?
 [dlp], fair enough, been awake for 30 hours myself :P
 eh my dad seems to like unity, and if ubuntu wants more desktop users i think it was a good move imo
 installed 11.04, after boot a purple screen comes up and nothing happens, what should i do?
