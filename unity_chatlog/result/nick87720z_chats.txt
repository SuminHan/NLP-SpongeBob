 Please, help me to upgrade distro from lucid
 I have ubuntu based distro
 Update manager from gnome just don't show new releases
 ah
 I checked to show only lts releases
 Is it possible?
 yeah, thanks
 Strange, that it needs special actions in command line
 failed to upgrade to 10.10 :( i found topic, where it is discussed. Imho, it would be nice to allow to resolve problems , e.g., via synaptic (it it allowes).
 Just tried update-initramfs -u -k all, and got line: "grep: /boot/config-2.6.32-26-generic: No such file or directory". Usually i remove old kernels, for now i have 2.6.32-31 for generic and preempt. Of course, initramfs file is created. I removed item in /lib/modules, but it is helpless. I have nothing installed with version 2.6.32-26*
 Can't find help in web search
 sipior: it just seems, that something gone wrong for that version. I would like to find source. As for me it is not blocking thing
