 sine: you have to install nvidia drivers 4 sure
 sine: sudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-current-modaliases nvidia-settings
 Trackymaniac: there is no Netbook edition
 Trackymaniac: http://ubuntu-with-wubi.blogspot.com/2011/04/no-more-netbook-edition-on-natty.html
 Trackymaniac: no Netbook for Wubi
 Trackymaniac: noprob
 Trackymaniac: I have tried Unity on my netbook and I was not very satisfied either...
 vanguard: sudo passwd user
 vanguard: root can set whatever password to any user
 vanguard: sudo rm -f /bin/laden :D
 Trackymaniac: I have switched back to 10.04 and replaced kernel with 2.6.38-8 and nVidia with 270
 andreas-aaa: not booting?
 probably yes
 I am using classic Ubuntu, not Netbook version
 wolfreak_99: you can install/extract anywhere
 nanuganga: you can reinstall 10.04 and then replace some packages - you get nearly the same
 wolfreak_99: you can symlink the entire folder
 wolfreak_99: or set it to a special partition (probably not an option)
 MustardCU: cannot be done
 MustardCU: it is a system device, it is always rooted
 wolfreak_99: use gparted
 wolfreak_99: / set as 16 GB or so, swap = 2 GB, /var may be for 5 GB and /home for the rest
 sine_: lspci
 MustardCU: not sure for this one
 MustardCU: /sys cannot be moved or linked
 wolfreak_99: not exactly
 wolfreak_99: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/linux-file-system-structure/
 MustardCU: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/linux-file-system-structure/ same for you
 MustardCU: very good website for knowledge IMHO
 wolfreak_99: MintBackup
 wolfreak_99: and you have to backup you source list (or maybe you can use ubuntu-tweak)
 wolfreak_99: for backing up, I have some scripts on my git: mxd.cz/git
 I have 2 scripts for backing up and restore
 sure you have symlink some Apps folders and move it to your /home
 wolfreak_99: the best backup solution is dd :) but takes time to create and to restore
 ZykoticK9: symlinked folder could work - as root of course
 wolfreak_99: I setup /media/BACKUP symlink to an external drive and then use my scripts - works great
 wolfreak_99: https://github.com/fifunja/Linux-shell-scripts
 wolfreak_99: when something happens, just boot Live flash, restore to / and reboot
 wolfreak_99: nVidia?
 wolfreak_99: you can google for some xorg.conf files for your card
 wolfreak_99: restore - erase / and restore back from the backup
 wolfreak_99: my friend had a problem with a new monitor so I have written the xorg.conf from scratch, fixed something and it works
 wolfreak_99: well - the best is to create a backup first
 wolfreak_99: I think that Live CD install erases the /
 wolfreak_99: oki doki
 wolfreak_99: have ya tried to purge compiz and then reinstall?
 wolfreak_99: try this - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1724835
 wolfreak_99: BTW you do not have to sudo compiz...
 wolfreak_99: compiz runs with your privs. only X11 runs as root
 Jasonn: new kernel, LibreOffice, Unity
 !unity
 Jasonn: makes headaches for many...
 Jasonn: http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/whats-new
 Jasonn: there are possible some tweaks to the fstab, newer kernel
 wolfreak_99: as you can see, your Intel driver is not capable of compiz, neither Unity as it is a plugin to compiz
 Jasonn: http://blog.mxd.cz/clanky-2011/ubuntu-asus-eee/ubuntu-asus-eee-en
 Jasonn: this article applies to any latest Ubuntu as well
 Jasonn: oops
 Jasonn: check it later then - there are pictures on my site
 wolfreak_99: The vesa driver is not capable of running Compiz, you need to install  the proper driver for your graphics card.
 wolfreak_99: nope, wine is not an option here
 SirScott: pastebin lspci here
 SirScott: it is not there listed
 SirScott: isn't it USB?
 SirScott: like mine --- Bus 008 Device 002: ID 0a12:0001 Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode)
 SirScott: try lsusb and pastebin here
 SirScott: yeap, oki
 LAcan: you mean = I want to run remote Ubuntu Terminal on my Windows?
 LAcan: mmnt, my memory...
 Jasonn: mxd.cz - asus eee english link
 LAcan: PuTTY
 LAcan: PuTTU is a telnet/ssh client for Windows
 LAcan: just ssh
 LAcan: remote desktop = teamviewer
 !teamviewer | LAcan
 LAcan: www.teamviewer.com/
 KNUBBIG: he just does not know :)
 LAcan: another option is RealVNC but takes more time to setup
 KM0201: right (Lacan)
 SirScott: sometimes things die... or get stolen :)
 envygeeks: I am behind 5 routers and teamviewer works
 KM0201: exactly - not very nice to portforward tons of ports on any router/AP in the network
 vanguard: killall pulseaudio ?
 gotta go, see ya round :)
