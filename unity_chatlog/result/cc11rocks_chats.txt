 hello ubuntu
 when does Ubuntu 11.04 come out?
 i know Ubuntu 11.04 comes out tomorrow
 like what exact time
 okay ty
 are the Beta versions different then the official ones?
 xiambax, did you just answer my question?
 cause i have the Beta version on my flash drive
 all the programs kept crashing
 upgrade to 10.10 then to 11.04 when it comes out
 np
 does anyone know how to make Ubuntu run faster? it runs quite slow on my computer
 or maybe it's because it on a flash drive...is there a performance drop in using a flash drive over a hard drive? i would think it would be faster in some cases
 *it's
 yes i do
 one sec

 Graphics: Digital flat panel 1024 X 768

 i've used 10.04, 10.10, and 11.04 Beta
 they all run kinda slow
 about half a year to a year
 it's a netbook
 never usr13
 with a netbook
 ?
 That's scary man
 i could do it w/ a regular desktop
 not with a netbook
 true
 running Windows 7 starter is fine
 it's fast
 i would dual boot if Ubuntu was faster...
 that's what i asked Johny_GM
 i know
 but Ubuntu is running slower on my computer
 not using as much RAM, but just slower
 just went to the release party chat...they say it will be April 28th somewhere in the world
 me?
 it IS the 28th in Australia or it will be released on the 28th in Austrialia?
 brb
 can you upgrade from Ubuntu Beta 11.04 to official version?
 do you lose any data?

 celthunder...and that makes it an executable jar?
 so i just have to jar it up in Ubuntu instead of Windows right?
 so how do i make it an exe jar?
 it's an exe in Windows
 i thought Java was multi-platform
 i don't have any OS specific things in my code
 mincraft is?
 a game?
 okay cool...so to be clear, BrumDart, that is the answer?
 i know the second part
 i make JARs through CLI in Windows
 well, i distribute to users
 they don't want to use CLI
 shebang?
 what is that?
 both
 add  "#!/usr/bin/java -jar" to the manifest file?
 April 28 for me in 4 hours
 not familiar with bash script
 similar to batch script? i know what it is
 just don't know for to code
 Ubuntu 11.04 is NOT online yet...

 hey Ubuntu
 have a question...
 i tried to make a JAR in Ubuntu...gave me blank lines
 like i typed in the correct information
 then under it, it had these ">" carrots
 what do i do after that?
 could anyone answer my question?
 I typed in:
 jar cmf program.mf program.jar *.class *.jar
 and it just gave me carrots with blank lines underneath
 JDK and JRE are properly installed
 hello71, "java -jar" runs the jar
 i am trying to create the jar
 I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 with a netbook...
