 A little problem here
 I want to remove a package
 but apt-get installs other packages automaticly
 so apt-get remove chromium, the following packes will be removed (...) the following packages will be installed (...)
 I don't want to install new packs
 I want to just remove the packages I specified
 Anyone has an idea?
 yes
 I will paste it
 http://http://paste.ubuntu.com/601522/
 It drives me crazy, even in Synaptic it auto-installs the packages
 I can't be deselected, and Lubuntu-desktop is beeing removes too... :X
