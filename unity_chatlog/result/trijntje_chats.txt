 are the update servers overloaded? I'm upgrading with only 40kB/s
 hypetech, ok, thanks. Maybe I should just cancel the upgrade and try again tomorrow. Or would that break stuff when its still downloading?
 sebsebseb, thats what I thought, good. Then ill just abort now and try again in a few days, when the server is not so busy
 is there somewhere I can check to find out if the update servers are still so congested? I dont want to update for 12 hours ;)
 sweb, unity is a compiz-plugin, but it conflicts with some other plugins if thats what you mean
 Dania, yeah, I would expect something to get damaged if you cut power during upgrade.
 sweb, what is simple compiz wizard?
 Dania, it might be easies to reinstall, do you have a backup of all your data?
 Dania, I dont know how to diagnose it, maybe someone else can help you with that
 sweb, compiz config settings manager, I should install fine in natty
 jAguAr`, what kind of help?
 jAguAr`, what does it say when you run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade in a terminal?
