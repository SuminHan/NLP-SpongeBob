 there is not a set hour it comes out. it does not release at 12 am. it could be any time on the 28th.
 anytime on the 28th.
 illmortal, cli means command line interface, there is no gui
 the ops should add 'no its not out yet' to the topic ;) not that it would help.
 12.
 doesnt matter what timezone, there is no time set
 Spaz_Dynamic, canonical has limited resources, they cant support every offshoot distro with a different DE
 2 minutes.
 Rehan, personal preference. ubuntu uses the gnome desktop enviroment by default, kubuntu uses KDE.
 Rehan, yes.
 Rehan, as i understand it, i believe so. hibernate is going to require a swap partition equal to or possible a bit more than your ram size.
 guest345345, as your use can fluctuate though i think most tutorials suggest a size equal to your ram to be on the safe side.
 it is still possible to run without unity so there is no real reason not to upgrade.
 without 3d support i have heard you just run ubuntu classic.
 kaatta, lxde uses openbox as a window manager. which doesnt have composite. most composite managers are their own window managers, and you only run one at a time.
 kaatta, you are going to need something like compiz then, there are no standalone composite managers that are still supported afaik. using compiz means you switch from openbox (lxde's standard window manager) to it.
 kaatta, i dont run lxde myself i cannot say. but standard ubuntu comes with compiz included.
 kaatta, a composite manager is going to be more cpu and graphics intensive, so that may not be the best option for you then
 kaatta, compiz is what gnome is running as a window manager by default when desktop effects are set to on, as i said i dont run lubuntu so i cant say how to add compiz to it.
 Fudge, you need isight firmware for it to work
 Fudge, the install does not come with them by default, so someone would have had to explicilty install them for the firmware to be there
 Fudge, hm i cannot say then, i am running 10.10 and am not having issues.
 thegoodcushion, most hp's are very well supported, i would not go with an offbrand.
 thegoodcushion, i am unsure of that specific model, your best bet is to google the model name and number, along with linux + ubuntu, see what kind of reviews or issues people are having.
 DJKorbit, unity is the default in 11.04
 DJKorbit, ah yes, that is true
 it is release day, of course there is traffic
 servers need time to propagate the new iso's, an official release worldwide is going to take some time.
 burg, most software is still written for 32 bit. some proprietary apps are not going to run on 64 bit without a chroot or multilib setup. It just means 32 bit is better supported at the moment.
 mythri, the user you login with is going to have your settings
 obengdako, by proprietary i mean games and the like, most apps are going to run fine in 64 bit. very few are going to be 32 bit specific these days.
 obengdako, lib32 stuff in a 64 bit system is multilib, which should work fine.
 obengdako, that would require a reinstall
 even on windows flash is a resource hog, so i agree with what jrib says. the issue is whether it is -more- resource intensive than suual
 crashanddie, there is an option when booting to choose ubuntu classic instead
 rgr, no
 all new UI take time for them to mature, when kde 4 started everyone hated it, it has come around, grnome 2.x has had -years- of dev ..
 not important
 can anyone running 11.04 confirm the seperate wallpaper for dual monitor bug is gone? in 10.10 you need to ctrl alt f7 /ctrl alt f1 for it to work
 bencc, sure why not.
 bencc, dont name another one root, thats about it
 batman people
 Psydoll, gimp
 gimp is not installed by default.
 gimp is soon to hit a new milestone, still inder active development
 he is a narwhal, big differnece
 kellnola, some of us dont want to deal with multilib issues, so stick with 32
 kellnola, i have to run wine still so 64 bit makes me jump through a few hooops i would rather not
 kellnola, usews compiz
 nameless`, it works, he's a good man is more appropriate these days, but whatev
 Flynsarmy, on login you can choose ubuntu classic, gnome 2.x
 Flynsarmy, thats six months to the day at the VERY leats ;)
 this channel is going to be drowned with unity haters for the next few months :/
 i am not a guinea pig, i wait for everyone else to figure out the problems
 always expect it to break everything.
 DirtyDawg, the OS requires around 4 gigs, so how much you need for apps and ata outside of that is your decision
 areay, probably part of your problem. you cant skip versions unless its lts to lts - you should have upgraded to 10.10 then 11.04
 thejonb, if its just slow, its the traffic the mirrors are getting hit with since 11.04 was released.
 cpgeek, vmware usually has to put out updates for new kernels when they are released - my guess is they have not addressed the kernel in 11.04
 Mr_Proper_, high traffic. its going to be like that for awhile.
 Giles, unity requires 3d, does your video card support it?
 Giles, dunno why it wouldnt be working then. there were no additional drivers required or anything?
 clbr, that would be wrong. there are other programs to copy the iso to the usb stick.
 zepherin, you choose classic at the login screen, unity should not be running
 i see.
 could someone tell me the best way to format an 'advanced format' (ie the larger sector) drive under linux?
