 I don't have an ICEauthority file and I can't log in into gnome-shell, what should I do?
 how can I regenerate the .ICEauthority file?
 ActionParsnip: I didn't have it in the first place
 ActionParsnip: And now it say can't update /home/username/.ICEauthority
 ActionParsnip: s/say/says/
 ActionParsnip: tried it, still says can't update
 ActionParsnip: so there should be a problem with permissions?
