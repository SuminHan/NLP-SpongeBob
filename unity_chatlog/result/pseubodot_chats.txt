 Upgraded 10.10->11.04 and love it, but am just surprised by how the 'emulate 3 button mouse' behaviour does not seem to exist any more ... is there a way to restore this?
 ActionParsnip: you mean manually put the Emulate3Button or whatever line back into the xorg.conf?
 ActionParsnip: but are there any other ways?
 ActionParsnip: cool, thanks!
 hi, I just upgraded a desktop running 10.10 to 11.04 and now I lost video. I know the machine boots (g15 driver kicks in and sets up the keyboard properly) but I cannot get network or a working display
 Is there a way I can force X to work minimally at boot?
 also, I don't see the grub screen either, so cannot go into single user mode
 jrib: the display is black, so given that the machine boots, I can't see it, and I have used both the onboard and the PCIe (ATI) card ports, and not seen anything
 jrib: it seems to be configured for some display, just not one I can see, apparently
 jrib: can't get to a shell on the box, can't ssh into the box (network not working post-upgrade)
 jrib: guess I would need a boot disk or something
 jrib: trying
 jrib: screen goes green post-boot
 jrib: ctrl+alt+f1 changed it
 jrib: didn't stay green long tho
 jrib: going to take out ati card, and use on-board video
 is there any way I can force my ubuntu desktop to boot only to console?
 Dr_Willis:recovery mode, correct?
 Dr_Willis: but I would have to run update-grub, no?
 Dr_Willis: right. I don't get the grub screen at boot (goes right through it), and my X is messed up after the 10.10>11.04 upgrade, so am trying to get back to cli to diagnose and fix
 Dr_Willis: am working off an install cd, and can edit files
 Dr_Willis: trying
 Dr_Willis: okay, I used the shift key as you said, then changed the grub cmd line part from 'quiet splash' to 'text'
 Dr_Willis: I'm seeing multiple errors on boot,
 Dr_Willis: looks like the machine borked, since the boot process doesn't finish, and I don't get a login prompt
 Dr_Willis: thanks for the help. I'm going to rebuild the box on another hd and use this one to recover
