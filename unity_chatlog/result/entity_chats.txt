 just upgraded to 11.04 via update-manager -d. after restart, i get "Ubuntu 10.10 The disk drive for / is not ready yet or not present..." how to fix? :\
 anyone know how to fix root filesystem not mounting?
 step21: how the filesystem won't mount.
 step21: i get "Ubuntu 10.10 The disk drive for / is not ready yet or not present..." upon boot. after that it says the same thing about /tmp
 step21: yes, I was running 10.10 and I upgraded with update-manager -d
 step21: I selected the top ubuntu entry from the bootmenu, and the ubuntu loading screen came on like normal with the four dots animation, but instead of loading like normal, it displays this: "Ubuntu 10.10 The diskdrive for / is not ready yet or is not present [...]"
 which automatically means it did not finish upgrading to 11.04
 step21: I wasn't here to see what would have went wrong with it. I'll try a disk check from live env and get back
 [dlp]: I'm on a different machine... I'll type it into a pastebin and get back
 [dlp]: I have a paste with my error and fstab contents: http://paste.ubuntu.com/600504/
 [dlp]: how do I do that? I dont have write access to anythng, even as root
 Monotoko: single-user mode?
 Monotoko: this is my problem: http://paste.ubuntu.com/600504/
 Monotoko: the stuff in the paste i sent you occur directly after selecting the top ubuntu entry in the boot menu.
 [dlp]: I thought the problem is that / will not mount at all...
 Monotoko: yes.
 [dlp]: Monotoko http://paste.ubuntu.com/600512/
 ok got the UUID of the partitions
 [dlp]: okay so I got the UUID for the partitions. What do I do with that?
 delete "/dev/sda2"? and replace with "UUID=<big string
 F. accidently hit enter
 [dlp]: sure. could you paste what they SHOULD look like afterward?
 wow that wasn't annoying.
 [dlp]: http://paste.ubuntu.com/600519/
 [dlp]: I kept getting sent to #ubuntu-read-to
 [dlp]: how do I get my write rights back to do that?
 what in the world
 lol
 [dlp]: it returned my prompt.
 [dlp]: sweet write rights are back. thanks
 [dlp]: edited the file.
 [dlp]: still get the error
 [dlp]: yeah
 [dlp]: I'm just gonna reinstall maverick from CD and then try again.
 because I dont have a Natty CD
 [dlp]: I'm not gonna risk it, I'm just gonna do clean install.
 [dlp]: how so? If I wipe the partiton clean (because I backed up my stuff before even doing this) and then clean install on the partition...?
 [dlp]: okay so my computer is off. I'm gonna turn it on, it produces that error, I press M, then what?
 [dlp]: ok now what
 [dlp]: what are the dots oh and it IS IN READ-WRITE
 [dlp]: not to worry, I have not executed any commands besides cat
 so how do I mount in readonly
 [dlp]: I just tried to nano a txt file and it didnt warn me about no write privs
 [dlp]: oh just kidding i'm in readonly
 [dlp]: the cat said meow. no seriously, it looks the same as last time
 [dlp]: /dev/disk/by-uuid/87d334b4-9a16-4621-967a-5f74491dd9e4 / ext4 ro,relatime,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0
 lol I will have my UUIDs memorized after tonight... :\
 okay
 [dlp]: what's the whole fsck command
 [dlp]: fsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2 e2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010) /dev/sda2: clean, 449495/1525920 files 5429183 blocks (check after next mount)
 [dlp]: but it's not.
 [dlp]: yeah it's giving me the original error with / not being ready or present. I really think I'm just gonna clean install
 [dlp]: thank you very much for your time and help no matter. :D
