 I'm having sound problems on an IMAC running natty.  Can anyone help or direct me to a better room to seek help?
 yes: the headphone jack doesnt seem to be recognized
 the other dimension of the problem is that in trying to fix it last month I changed the naming of the computer in I don't know what file
 24 inch IMAC, 2.8GHz dual core
 ActionParsnip.  thanks.  gimme a second
 ActionParsnip: which two files  in BOTH /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname ?
 ActionParsnip it's not the hostname that is the problem

 One thing I need to accomplish is changing my "snd-hda-intel: model=macpro" back to IMAC, does anyone know where this is done?
 Thanks ActionParsnip.  I'll get back to you.  Should I reboot to know if it's working?
 thank Oh6
 ActionParsnip?
 I'm having a natty screen problem: when I switch between applications the application I switch too appears frozen until I stimulate it somehow like rolling up the window and rolling it back down.  Any ideas?  A compiz problem?
 ActionParsnip: Thanks for your help the other day with my sound problem: all is well now
 Anyone experiencing screen freezes in Natty that can be unfrozen by rolling the window up and down?
