 hi, I can't boot windows 7 since I Reinstalled grub -- tried using windows 7 repair utility / command line tools / nothing seems to work .. can anyone help please? thanks!
 Jordan_U: it just hangs
 Jordan_U: cursor
 Jordan_U: again, sure
 Jordan_U: RESULTS are here: http://pastebin.com/5pEUfjMa
 Jordan_U: RESULTS grub actually just got removed when i tried to run the command line utils
 Jordan_U: so i tried to boot from windows partition (without grub) and it still won't boot
 Jordan_U: now I'm reinstalling grub again
 Jordan_U: here are the RESULTS after installing grub again: http://pastebin.com/nUPQeVPA
 sorry, Jordan wrong linkg
 Jordan_U: correct link after grub install: http://pastebin.com/nUPQeVpa
 Jordan_U: the weird thing is, I have to use fdsik to toggle off the bootable option on the Win7 partition, otherwise grub won't run, and if i do that, i run grub and select win7 but i doesn't boot
 Tooyota-4Runner: did you try running the boot info script?? lol
 Tooyota-4Runner: wait, check out this thread first http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1401716
 Tooyota-4Runner: alright see what the script says then
 Jordan_U: how do you install grub to the MBR?  I've installed grub following the same procedure more or less in all the ubuntu docs
 taglass: thanks ill try that
 taglass: why do the ubuntu docs say to use grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda?
