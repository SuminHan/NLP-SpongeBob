 having just tried ubuntu for the first time in a year - what a fabulous release. thanks devs.
 is there a dev channel for ubuntu?
 Flannel, thanks but i only see like 4 people there?
 Flannel, ah okay thanks
 Flare183, because i want to contribute? unless u try to stop me :)
 my ubuntu just switched from the slick default appearance to a dull gnome standard one... anyone knows why this might have happened?
 on login
 Dr_Willis, is there a way to check if that has happened?
 ok thanks
 after i logged in, the appearance had changed from the usual slick dark gray one to this: http://i54.tinypic.com/kbq4hs.jpg (note gnome default icons) ... why might this have happened? at login, my session thingy was 'Ubuntu'
 my desktop has changed appearance to a default gnome look - how can this have happened or how can i get the slick ubuntu look back?
 atlef, i'll try that thanks
