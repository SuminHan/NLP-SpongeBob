 Hello. I have an mp4 player. I cannot find my mp3/mp4 files once I've transferred them from my laptop to my mp4 player. However, I can see the files, just not the contents. What am I missing?
 kkal: is shows up on my desktop as a 7.8 GB Filesystem
 kkal: I see the folders but not the mp3/mp4/avi, or whatever
 kkal: I don't have this problem on Windoze so I suspect I am simply missing a file
 kkal: I had the same problem under a different distro. Help told me I was simply missing a file but I cannot even remember the name of it. It was something about compatibility or codecs or something
 kkal: the mp4 player's software is android
 kkal: could it be due to me missing ffmpeg?
 kkal: I'm just installing ffmpeg now
 kkal: it hasn't made a difference. I can see the files within the folders through Ubuntu but when I try to run them with the mp4 player is see only folders without content.
 kkal: there is some sort of file I must download through synaptic that let's my laptop communicate properly with my mp4 player. I am sorry I don't know the terminology.
 kkal: I've downloaded and solved the problem in the past, but I just cannot remember the name of it.
 kkal: can't remember but I'll try it
 kkal: I'm not sure this is the right one but yes it is this sort of program
 kkal: no, that didn't work. However, in the mp4 player I could finally see the avi file. But, unfortunately I got the message it was an unsupported file. This has something to do with communication between Ubuntu and the mp4 player.
 11.04 isn't communicatiing properly with my external mp4 player. Any ideas?

 yehudah: I had the same problem and found the solution on google. It was something about changing a setting in the first screen
 yehuda: gimme a sec to see if I can find the link for you
 yehudah: sorry, I am new here and don't know how to do it. However, I have your answer here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1685134
 Hello, I cannot play files on my mp4 player when I've transferred them from Ubuntu. However, they work fine when transferred from Windoze. Please save me from having to reinstall Windoze!!!
 ikonia: yes, in some circles. ;)
 ikonia: is that a rule or a preference?
 ikonia: sorry, but as a newb I'm lost when it comes to terminology. I've had this problem in the past but cannot remember the name of the program I need. As for respect, after spending a bundle and reinstalling on the 20th time, I was shown respect by not being allowed to reinstall until I sent them 199 USD for a new key.
 ikonia: you just got here. I've been here for hours and others have been trying to help. But I lack the terminology to clearly explain the problem with my mp4 player.
 ikonia: I was talking about Linux terminology. I couldn't care less about MS.
 ikonia: I'm happy for you

 I cannot play files on my mp4 player when I've transferred them from Ubuntu. On the mp4 player I can see the folders but not the contents. In Ubuntu I can see the folder and contents of the mp4 player. I had this problem before with PCLOS and was told to install a program that enabled communication between the OS and the mp4 player. It worked perfectly after. But I cannot remember the name of the program or the type of program it was.

 Chrom: I had that problem once. It was my fault. I did something with Tweak. Are you using it?
