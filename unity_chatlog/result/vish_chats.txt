 samtate: the support landed on 11.04, there is no easy way and not sure if anyone has tried, but if you want you could try upgrading the indicator and banshee extension
 samtate: right, ;)  its not an easy way.. and no one might have tried it.. you'd have to figure it out yourself ;p[
 samtate: no ppa, you;d have to download the natty packages and install in maverick.. should probably work since not much has changed from maverick » natty , atleast the GTK/GNOME part
 samtate: on launchpad
 bassliner: that bar cannot be moved..
 samtate: the natty debs should be available.. the ones that are installed for natty
 bassliner: the design team, but  thats offtopic here.. feel free to use #ubuntu-offtopic for venting ;)
 samtate: as i said, that takes some work.. it *will* be there, search launchpad for the debs..
 !ot | bassliner
 samtate: the debs are definitely needed to install those packages in natty, so there is no possible way the debs are not present.. (nope, I aint gonna search for it) :)
 samtate: but they are there.. ;)
 samtate: neat! i told ya it will be there..  :)
