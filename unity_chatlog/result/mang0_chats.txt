 Guys, my ubuntu 10.10 livecd won't install...it won't mount my drives, and it won't connect the internet with my broadcom wifi card (i know the model)....it's very annoying as I  really wanna dump windows LOL. Someone suggested that I try 10.04, but I don't want to burn a new cd. I thought I could use daemon tools to run the .iso, would that work?
 okay, well It won't mount my partitions
 okay
 let me write this better in pasteall.org
