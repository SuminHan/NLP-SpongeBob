 hey all! I'm needing to transfer files from a 9.04 installation (ext3) to 10.10 (ext4) but the systems is telling me that my 9.04 system does not support ext4 - what can I do to make this happen?
 What do I have to do to transfer files from an ext3 files system to an ext4 file system - my 9.04 installation tells me that it does not support ext4
 YEah I've installed Meerket but need to move files to that install from 9.04
 I'm trying to move a ton of mp3, ogg, flac, etc files to my new Meerkat install (ext4) but 9.03 (ext3) won't let me
 jrib: yes but I'm planning on wiping that drive for Natty, right now I just want to back up the files on the Meerkat install - I have never upgraded since Warty, always a clean install -
 jrib: are you saying there is no way to back up to ext4 file system
 jrib: are you talking about an upgrade?
 jrib: ok... I was thinking maybe something like tune2fs (or whatever it;s called might help out... no?
 jrib: OK ... I was thinking maybe something like tune2fs might help... no?
 jrib: thanks, I'll give it a shot... unless... if I boot to the new Meerkat, might I be able to move those files from the 9.04, rather than the other way ;round (which didn't work)
 Cool! that would definitely be the easiest then... thanks!!
 One more thing... I've read over the years that upgrades from one release to the next Ubuntu release has caused problems - is this an ongoing thing?
 jrib: always makes me a bit too nervous to attempt - I'll have to get another 2TB drive and make an exact copy before trying it... just to be safe
 ashmew2: any advice on what the upgrade might depend on... personal experience, or hearsay?
 jrib: ahh.. obvious but I hadn't thought of that
 Ashmew2: jrib: good advice thanks to both of you.
 happy release day!
