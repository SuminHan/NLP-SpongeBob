 have a server box that has a failed upgrade to 11.04 - trying to recover using a recovery CD. I did a series of apt-get -f and dpkg --configure -a .... that made some progress, however it appears to have reached the end. dpgk --configure -a keeps failing
 can I force a re-application of the upgrade?
 jrib, can't paste bin - no ssh, using recovery CD
 jrib, in a console, nothing use. no X
 jrib, I can bring up networking via the recovery CD, but still no browser
 thanks jrib - what did you do, proxy to pastebin? brb... server is in rack in other room
 jrib, talk about valuable now thought... brb
 jrib, thanks for the help so far! apparently one of the last runs of dpkg or apt-get broke something worse. Can't get a shell anymore. Going to reinstall base system. data is on raid anyway
 has anyone tried to compile x264 on 11.04? keeps failing on my server install
 hey folks
 having trouble with 11.04 - cant get mysql-core-5.1 to install, suspect its because of a previous install. Tried to purge it, no dice
