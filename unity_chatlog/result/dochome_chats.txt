 I'm watching unity vids on youtube. Is it possible to disable the unified toolbar? (e.g. the OS X toolbar in the top no matter where your window is)
 s/OS X/OS X style
 anyone?
 nmvictor: I'm with you there
 ubuntu: no, it has silly stuff
 killer_: try x-chat
 killer_: most people use that or irssi (console based)
 killer_: yep, haven't used many though
 back later
