 zachgretzinger, yes
 zachgretzinger, yes, but it is a bit involved and a jar and a deb isn't nearly similar things, so you can't do a straight off conversion
 zachgretzinger, http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/
 zachgretzinger, bear in mind that you'll probably have to do more things than to just put your .jar in a debian package
 zachgretzinger, the jars are pretty easy, doing debs are a bit more involved :D
 zamN, are you trying to build the compiler from scratch instead of installing the packages?
 !gcc
 zamba, yes, you might want to install automake too
 zamba, sorry, mistabbed
 zamN, yes, you might want to install automake too
 p896gbm, I find that it works nicely to run ubuntu in virtualbox
 kapu: yes :D
 kapu: try -C <target>
 kapu: success?
 kapu: use / to search :D
 kapu: also, you might have more luck with "info tar"
 kapu: tar -C targetdir -xf sourcefile
 kapu: add flags as needed, for example j or z and or v
 kapu: why are you having the path there twice?
 kapu: 'tar -zxvf file.tar.gz  -C ./path/to/file/wanted_file'
 kapu: oh, I didn't realise you're trying to extract only one file from the archive
 kapu: so what is not working with the command you pasted?
 kapu: I'd also try to prepend -C
 kapu: that unfortunately looks correct to me
 kapu: and by nested, you mean that tar is preserving the whole path to the file?
 kapu: it expects the dir to exist, look into using --strip-components <numberofdirstostrip>
 kapu: I'm just googling really

 RavenHursT: cp -r <src> <target>?
 RavenHursT: seeing your last statement
 RavenHursT: cp -r .??* * <target>
 RavenHursT: it wasn't clear that you didn't want to copy the first directory
 RavenHursT: lmtt?
 RavenHursT: you can, and the last one is always the target
 RavenHursT: the ?? in .??* are important, without them you'll end up having .. in the list of files to copy, and things will go poorly
 RavenHursT: happy to help :D
 Diverdude: https://launchpad.net/glipper might be something for you then
 Diverdude: I can't say I've tried it myself :D
