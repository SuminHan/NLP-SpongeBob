 Question for the intellihancia
 Can anyone tell me if there are any issues with upgrading to 11.04?  Specifically concerning how your desktop is displayer?
 Displayed...
 I upgraded to 11.04
 Yes, I noticed the major change...
 Well, I see that gnome is running so I guess gnome is still the window manager on my system.
 Do I have to switch to Unity?
 thor: Alright.  Classic works better with gnome?
 thor: Alrighty...  I'll give it a shot.  Thank you.
 Thanks all
 Well, I logged in using Ubuntu Classic but my desktop icons are still all jacked up...  lol
 I have to say, I like Ubuntu Classic much better than the new one...
 Robin: I don't appear to have that option at login...  :(
 Just getting my desktop back to normal would be all I need....
 Ah, Unity didn't come with the update?
 So is Unity a Desktop Manager or a new X server?
 Ok...  I guess my issue is not with Unity...  After upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04 my desktop icons are ENORMOUS and I can no longer click on them.
 Ah HA!  I figured it out.  I'm using two monitors.  When I have both monitors on my desktop is stretched across both and no longer works correctly...
 When I just have one monitor on the desktop displays correctly.
 Dr: There does eh?
 Alright, posted my Desktop stretching issue to the Ask Ubuntu site.  Hope someone knows if there is a fix...
 Good night all.  Have a good weekend....
 Watch out for those insane batteries...  They can do strange things...  LOL
