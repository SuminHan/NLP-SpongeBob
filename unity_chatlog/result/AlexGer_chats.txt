 hello, i'm installing "Zentyal" Ubuntu. During the installation process i receive the following errormessage. (free translated from german..)
 Could'nt find an installable Kernel in the APT-Sources
 helo, i need your help please
 i didn't realy asked to ask :-)
 i installed ubuntu in english to tell you the correct error message:
 [!]Install the base System
 No installable kernel was found in the defined APT sources.
 You may try to continue without a kernel, and manually install your own kernel Later.
 This is only recommended for experts, otherwise you will likely end up with a machine that doesn#t boot.
 Continue without installing a kernel? <Go Back> <Yes> <No>
 that's my problem
