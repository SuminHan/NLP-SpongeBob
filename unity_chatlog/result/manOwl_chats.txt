 So I found a package that I don't believe is in the ubuntu repositories and it's pretty good
 If I make a .deb for it and stuff, can I submit it?
 How are packages selected for inclusion?
 bp0: ms-sys
 bp0: it allows you to make a windows 7 mbr and stuff. it can be used to create a bootable windows 7 usb drive from linux
 I was thinking about maybe making a little GUI in python for it
 to create a bootable win 7 drive from linux
 bp0: you promise not to steal my idea ;)?
 Jordan_U: and that works for win7 etc?
 Jordan_U: cool
 :D
 mcurran: hm, i wonder if it would run successfully off of a usb stick like that.
 so i think that the newest release of ubuntu.. combined with the hardware compatibility of linux, the repositories, and stuff... and this new UI
 windows 7 is an inferior OS
 this is actually the first distribution that is legitimately easier to use than windows
 Ultimate_Chaos: does it render all the textures correctly?
 i had portal running, but it was not rendering all the textures
 because i had to run it in dx8 mode
 hobbel: the list of files is not bound to the file itself..
 hobbel: the filesystem stores the filenames, inodes, inumbers etc..
 hobbel: the file itself is a binary blob
 hobbel: you're missing filenames?
 paths etc?
 hobbel: first, are the files really important
 what are they
 hobbel: recovering lost files on a drive is very time consuming, I assume you have a really, really good reason to want the files?
 also stop using the drive now or you'll ruin your chances
 hobbel: you're not going to be able to recover 80gb of files that have lost filesystem entries.
 hobbel: i don't know what the best software is for recovering a lost file, but it can be done with dd.
 hobbel: what do you mean, free your lost space?
 hobbel: when the filesystem loses a file, that space is considered free!
 you're constantly overwriting your old files as you use your computer
 hobbel: either you are not looking hard enough for the file that is taking up your space, or you need to make a new filesystem.
 hobbel: try the tool baobab
 it finds the biggest files to delete
 hobbel: there are two possibilites. that you used a ton of space, or that the filesystem is corrupt and needs to be erased and reformatted.
 hobbel: some runaway program probably created a big file on your computer.
 hobbel: sudo apt-get install baobab <--- run this, find the big file, delete it.
 if you can't, then you need to make a new filesystem.
 hobbel: what do you mean it finds the files as space?
 hobbel: the numbers that df -h reports are definitely incorrect?
 hobbel: you can try fsck

 Where did the desktop effects preferences go in 11.04!?
 trailoryo: the gimp
 man why isn't it easy to add a launcher to the unity panel?
 i just want to put a terminal on there
 that's what I tried
 maybe I dragged it wrong
 This panel is not ready for primetime
 I am disappoint.
 tensorpudding: duh
 tensorpudding: two problems here
 tensorpudding: dragging it to the bottom does not work, it seems intuitive to drag into empty space. for it to work you must drag it to the top
 second problem
 I just added the launcher to my panel
 and it instead inserted a blank space the size of the launcher
 with no icon
 ohsix: i don't use developmental software
 i stay on stable releases
 which is why I am a bit peeved
 I might have to file a couple bugs.
 yeah
 i'm taking a video of it now
 and gonna post it on launchapd
 ohsix: i don't think it's a bad idea, i think it's kinda cool
 ohsix: but there are some things..
 ohsix: for example, a lot of apps in the repositories have 1995 icons that look like shit
 and when those icons are shown in unity
 its just ugly
 ohsix: sure there is, they should just remove the apps
 a lot of them are trash anyway
 tensorpudding: there are misc apps being shown in the "hey download this" part
 and they have ugly icons
 I don't care to be interrupted with information about some text based roleplaying game from 1998
 when I'm searching the apps on my desktop
 ohsix: i will have to put it in a blog.
 sorry
 I am sorry for ranting earlier
 usually I set the key /apps/metacity/general/button_layout in gconf to move my window buttons to the right
 but in unity, when I maximize a window
 the buttons move to the left of the top bar!
 so if I move my buttons to the right, then maximize.. all my buttons move to the left!?
 is there another key?
