 is ubuntu natty using gnome 3 now?
 is Natty stable enough to install? the last time I had lots of problems with ubuntu-desktop + unity + nvidia
 hypetech: did you upgrade from maverick?
 hypetech: are you happy with what you got in Natty?
 kkal: don't you like unity?
 I guess MAC users like it
 I don't think that I like it, I prefer terminal to unity
 kkal: what have they done to Alt+F2 ? :o
 kkal: that's obscene , jk
