 hi Actionpasnip
 is there a way to cht 1-1 as this is a little confusing?
 i cant get in to the system at all -= this is a nother pc
 on booting I just get a small white rectablge in the centre, with occasioanally loving bizarre characters
 moving bizarre characters LOL
 as in text
 It wont even boot into previous installs
 same issue
 ActionParsnip: any ideas?
 just upgraded to 11.04 and following a reboot cant get in at all....help
 It started off as an issue with evolution, following the upgrade to 11.04
  I tried to open evolution but it appeared to hang when trying to retrieve files ie went greyed out..
 I rebooted a couple of tuimes but the same problem persisted.
  In the end, on reboot I seletd start with prompt and opp[ted for "repair broken files"...
  And ever since then all I get at boot is a small white rectangle with starge text objects
 Krishnandu: I may hava  similar prob
 Krishnandu: is thee a roll back option ?
 Krishnandu: so maybe boot from a disk and do a fresh install?
 Krishnandu: me too. so what's the fix? any idea?
 Krishnandu: i hope its soon - i got a lot to do
 Krishnandu: could be - I have an invidia card too. bugger
 Krishnandu: got it thanks. not sure it helps much tho - how can w run a script when we cant see the screen ? :(
 Krishnandu: do you think a video card with a direfent chipset might be ok?
