 PsyI see more than half a dozen "how-to's" in the first page of results...

 elb0w: Then you should have asked "Is it a bad idea to install Gnome3 on 11.04?"
 Soothsayer: Yes
 Soothsayer: Well is something goes wrong with your boot drive you don't have to worry about the data on your other drive
 Soothsayer: Having less simultaneous access on your drives should give higher performance
 Soothsayer: Common logic
 Soothsayer: normally Ubuntu will point them to /mnt automatically and you just click to mount from Nautilus
 Soothsayer: Or /media .. I mix those up sometimes
 Soothsayer: My other drives were always visible in Nautilus.  I click and it auto-mounts and I'm just going through my partitions on it
 [09:16]	Soothsayer	ubuntutryout777, [TK]D-Fender : my home directory should be on the data drive right ? <- up to you
 Soothsayer: I use /home on my OS drive and I manually move what I want to my data drive.  I count my entire OS drive as being separate.
 Soothsayer: You don't have to keep stuff in /home
 Soothsayer:That's a personal choice.  I have always preferred to file things where *I* want them to be
 Soothsayer: For your DB question... I'd say put it on the drive where it will have the most % of free resources to itself
 [09:19]	Soothsayer	[TK]D-Fender: So you are saying just keep the entire Ubuntu on one drive... and then use a partition from the data drive for all my data? <- That is what I like to do.  Its a personal thing.  For me the OS is a tool, but my datat is sacred
 [09:20]	Soothsayer	[TK]D-Fender: won't that be the data drive? <- for the case you've been describing, it sounds like "yes"
 Soothsayer: That is certainly one way to do it.  I'm pretty sure you could change your configs to explicitly point elsewhere through... that is a DB config issue you'd have to actually look at their own docs for
 20 mins until both 32/64 bit releases finish downloading here :)
 DeathKnight: No you haven't... it's still "released" ;)
 Soothsayer: Yup
 Soothsayer: Already answered yes the first time...
 knick: he just completely the internet!
 knick: This wasn't for me.  I was just sharing your poking fun at some tragic grammar...
 Hi, I installed 11.04 on an XP2500+ with a crappier video card.  When I did it firs ttold me I was too low end for Unity and got kicked back to Gnome 2.32 classic.  I have jsut replaced the video card with an ATI Radeon 9200 SE which I'd like to think would ahve been enough for the basics... but when restarting I don't seem to be getting the new interface.  Any tips?
 cousin_mario: Yup... no proprietary drivers offered in that box either BTW
 (the admin box that is)
