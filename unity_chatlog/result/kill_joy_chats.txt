 hello thelord
 what up
 luis - type "display" in the unity search app  and you can mess with the resolution after clicking "monitor"
 I just went there and  there's a pull down menu
 just did a quick check...  I'm sure you're right
 ok, I just typed "nvidia" into the unity search and got my graphix card settings...  try typing in yours
 once you're in your settings (nvidia in my case) your display settings are to the right (pull down menu) lets you choose new resolution
