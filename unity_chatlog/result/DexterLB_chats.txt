 hello. I have been given a laptop with radeon x1200, and I have to get 3D accel working in the next 3 hours, or I won't get paid :D
 I've tried so many things, and I've almost given up hope
 fglrx doesn't seem to work with that chip, nothing in ubuntu's hardware driver suggestions and envy isn't available on maverick
 neckoox, escott: I tried installing all the fglrx packages, it says no supported hardware
 escott: yup
 Pici: does it have 3D?
 Pici: hmm, compiz here says No GL
