 Spotted a bug in the 11.04 disk partition part of the installer. No longer lets you type a mount point. You can only select from the drop-down list of options.
 Not liking 11.04 at all... Going to give it a chance for a week, but I'm just getting frustrated with it at the moment... :-/
 shane4ubuntu: I could, but I want to give it a try if this the future of the Ubuntu desktop, just to be fair...
 Is there anyway to turn off the Apps for Download list?
 ninjai: Ctrl+N?
 ninjai: If you have the file manager open, Ctrl+N should open another window.
 ninjai: I had the same issue this morning and when trying to open multiple terminal windows. :-/
 Does anyone know if there's any way to turn off the Apps for Download list thingy?
 skulltip: It's different...
 skulltip: Feels very... clunky and awkward at the moment. But it's only been a few hours in the driving seat.
 skulltip: Don't play that many games, to be honest, so I cannot help you there.
 skulltip: First time I've used Compiz for a few releases.
 Ctrl+W makes switching between Apps on Desktops a lot easier...
 Oops! I meant Super+W makes switching between Apps on Desktops a lot easier...
 ManDay: No. The netbook and desktop versions are now one and the same.
 Webupd8 (http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/things-to-tweak-fix-after-installing.html) has some nice tweeks. I've turned off the new scrollbars as: A) Not all Apps support them, and B) I just prefer proper scollbars.
 Why are most Apps opening maximised when I launch them?!?
 yuskhanzab: I guess the servers are getting overloaded a bit at the moment. Apt-get install is also slower than normal at the moment.
 conorhogan: Super+S or Ctrl+Alt+Arrow
 conorhogan: Windows Key + S
 conorhogan: Assuming your keyboard has Windows key, of course...
 conorhogan: That would be a know then... ;-)
 conorhogan: Maybe the "Command" key?
 Does anyone know if there's any way to turn off the "Apps for Download" list thingy?
 How do I report a bug in the Natty installer? I have Launchpad account, but when I click on Report a Bug, I just get taken to another web page about reporting bugs...
 Nevermind... I've figured it out...
 ninjai: You can also open multiple windows by clicking with the middle mouse button on the launcher icon.
 I'm getting quite annoyed with applications seemlingly defaulting to opening maximised, e.g. Totem. Is there anyway to turn this maximise behaviour off?
