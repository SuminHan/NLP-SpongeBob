 hello
 i've just updated my ubuntu into 11.04.... how can i remove this unity panel with apps icons? i really like 'docky' ;/
 and the default apps menu under 'gnome icon'
 sebsebseb, unity looks fine with this 'global menu' feature
 but the only thing is that panel and menu ;/
 uhm
 ok, thanks, i'll try
 lol
 sebsebseb, where i can find 'logout' here? : D
 hmm
 sebsebseb, where i can find this 'global menu' feature now?
