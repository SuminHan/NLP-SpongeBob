 hi everybody, i have successfully setup NFS server and client but only root has 'rwx' and the other groups have only 'rx' but i want everyone to has 'rwx' access; how can i do that? thnx
 here's is the line i added in the /etc/exports file: /home  192.168.1.124(rw) and when i try to connect to it using the client, only root has access to rw but other groups have rx; how do i make everyone have 777 access like in 'chmod 777 filename'

 escott: do you mean what i wrote in that file? if so, this is what is wrote in that file: /home  192.168.1.124(rw)
 escott: /etc/exports......this is where you edit what folders and files you want to share, to whom and what writes and options
 escott:
 escott: NFS
 escott: no......i don't know how to do that; i'm able to connect to the server and see the files but i can't write to it unless i'm root; i want everyone to have 777 access that connects to the server
 escott: oh ok; thanks.....i'll do some research on that
 escott: thanks for the link
