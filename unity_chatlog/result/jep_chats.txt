 hey guys, my ubuntu boot isn't detecting my pcix ethernet card. when i do 'lshw -C network', it as well as the board's nic show up as 'DISABLED'. I do a 'sudo ifconfig eth1 up' (eth1 is the pcix nic), but still nothing and rebooting makes it disabled again. /etc/network/interfaces only contained the two 'lo' entries so i added ones for eth0 and eth1 (before reboot). Any ideas? I've been out
 for like a week now.
 anything?
 should I make a pastebin?

 Omega: it's not wifi
 why would the ethernet suddenly stop being detected?
 i guess i have to reinstall the os?
 i am on 10.10
 yes
 i installed a pci-x ethernet card and 10.10 isn't detecting it
 but i'm using it on windows right now
