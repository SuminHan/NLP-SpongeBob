 Am I going nuts, or did Ubuntu 11.04 seriously zap my laptop's battery?
 I can't get more than 45 minutes out of 11.04 no matter what I try. 10.x had no trouble getting over 2 hours out of the same battery, and Windows easily goes over 3 hours :-/
 Incarus6: Ah...so it's time to format.
 No sense using the new version if it's going to drain my battery that fast
 Inarus6: Yes, first thing I did was ditch Unity, it's terrible
 Only other time I've seen the battery drain this quickly was when Fedora had some horrible glitch that loaded the video card fully non-stop
 lol
