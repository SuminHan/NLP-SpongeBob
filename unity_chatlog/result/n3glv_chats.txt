 quick natty question, on remix it was possible to use ubuntu desktop instead of unity, is that feature still in natty?
 cache_surplus: sounds like an issue with grub installer
 ok Soothsayer so, same as unr, just hit the user then select at bottom?
 cache_surplus: beyond me, but yes check bios setting
 my other small beef is that on this old pc, I stuck in the 11.04 disk, it said there was upgrade, I said ok, and it's getting EVERYTHING via my slow interrnet, has not hid the cd at all
 what's the point to offering upgrade from cd if it then uses the internet?
 ActionParsnip: no, normal narwal desktop i386
 cache_surplus: for usb try looking for usb options like enhanced or 2.0 vs 1.1
 ActionParsnip: I find this out, after starting a NINE HOUR UPGRADE!
 meh, I just expect that when it's sensing a cd with newer version and offering to upgrade, that it would do it from CD media
 wilbur_cobb: ricer! <wink>
 computergeeksjw: interrupt grub loader, init=0
 ooops 1
 if u want networking, init=3
 strigoi66: you try lspci or dmesg|more to find out the manufacturer of the wifi?
 testbe: at user prompt screen click user, then select in text at bottom of screen, ubuntu desktop
 cache_surplus: some pc do not show the option unless device is connected/has a disk in it
 cache_surplus: on some pc I have to go into the boot options page (f-10 or 12) to see the cdrom as bootable
 cache_surplus: might need to use the alternate cd
 cache_surplus: make sure there is nothing that's 'protecting' your boot sector
 cache_surplus: last freebsd I used was 2.2.2
 ;-p
 of course, first slackware was 0.0.9
 56 floppies to get the libs to compile the kernel
 cache_surplus: seen a few usb sticks that would not boot
 strigoi66:  Broadcom Corporation BCM4318
 u may have to play with google to find broadcom driver stuff
 truepurple: synaptic?
 truepurple: may need to enable older repos
 truepurple: system > synaptic package manager
 truepurple: u can search in synaptic for apps
 truepurple: synaptic lists all the software on the pc, and can download/install more from the repository system
 it's like a super version of the ubuntu software thingy
 hit reload first truepurple
 umm, yeah, think so
 truepurple: I think so
 truepurple: may want to browse your dir, see if you can find files that u want to save
 truepurple: but I think it should work
 jon_gee: ever see this , USER ASKING FOR HELP KEEPS ASKING SAME QUESTION OVER AND OVER?
 BEGGING EVEN
 his recursive thing
 truepurple: wondering if just the shortcut is missing
 truepurple: if u know the app name u could try launching it from command line (terminal)
 daniel_: may be missing a propriatary driver
 truepurple: ask google about a program called 'slocate'
 it can search the hard drive for a file name
 truepurple: u need to do updatedb first
 truepurple: then locate tomboy
 arch_is_awesome: k3b is cool
 truepurple: the slocate app needs to be installed
 demlasjr: power settings or screen save?
 demlasjr: sleep mode?
