 Is it possible to have ubuntu 11.04 64bit and 32bit and gparted all on one usb stick?  I have 11.04 on the stick now, but I'd like to have access to all three on one stick.
 not sure about parted magic, but ubuntu 11.04 64/32 are downloaded as such
 nit-wit ; thanks i'll check that out
 Getting an error when trying to do a live session of ubuntu 11.04. ||initramfs||  using the same usb stick earlier today on another machine worked fine, this is an x64 compatible machine
 is there error logged anywhere? it just references initramfs, busybox 1.17 and something about live..
 so nothing was written to my flash drive?
 pfifo, is what i mentioned enough information?
 bleh, is it possible for me to get it to write the text output on the screen to a file, i can't find anything to write with ;\
 i thought of that, my phone camera is shite, i'll try though
 brb, thanks

 pfifo; thanks going to tinker, bbl
 pfifo, still around?
 pfifo, i was using a usb 3.0 port
 pfifo, used a 2.0, fixed
 pfifo, now that i'm inside, its not detecting my usb 3.0 HDD - i'd assume the two problems are related?
 i'm trying this gnome device manager, so i can attempt to determine if its not recognized, linux nub :(
 pfifo, is that to say if i installed the full version it would recognize my external 3.0 drive?
