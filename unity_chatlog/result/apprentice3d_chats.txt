 The 11.04 will be on friday
 sebsebseb: you're right - 28th is Thursday
 Sebsebseb: for me there are still less than 3 minutes :)
 I think they should have put a countdown or something because my notebook is now clean and waiting for official 11.04
 sebsebseb: then I was right, it will be available on Friday (if the servers will survive)
