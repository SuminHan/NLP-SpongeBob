 Wow.  I'm going to stick with unity for a few days to see if it grows on me, but first impressions are god-awful.
 vanguard: That it defaults to unity.
 nutsfornatty: maybe that'll help.  I hate that it steals the menu bar and puts it up top ala OSX
 vanguard: Yes, I'm just avoiding it for a few days to see if unity will grow on me ;)
 vanguard: But it seems solid so far (mind you I've been using it for all of 20 minutes now).
 Does the time&date applet use the ntpserver listed in /etc/default/ntpdate?
 OK, if one is to use unity, how do you go about adding and removing programs from that silly bar?
 escott: OK. Not very elegant, but I'll do it for now :)
 escott: Thanks.
 Err, is the ubuntu software center very laggy for anyone else since the 11.04 update?
 LjL: nutsfornatty: I don't care about the time to download and install, it's that _after_ the page is loaded, it's periodically freezing for a second or two, when scrolling around, then behaves fine.
 Today of all days, I expect slow downloads.
 mmiller235: Do you have 3d enabled, or the ubuntu virtualbox drivers installed?
 mmiller235: gnome-classic in 11?  I think that's still compiz
 mmiller235: OK.  Well, try and install the virtualbox guest extensions for ubuntu.  See if it helps.
 mmiller235: That's odd then.  I've used ubuntu 9, 10, and 11 (the beta at least) in virtualbox and not had that issue.
 mmiller235: Virtualbox all on the same system that's giving you trouble now?
 thanos: Define the problem.
 thanos: What does it say when you try?  What are the filesystems on them?
 thanos: Did you first check /proc/filesystems to make sure btrfs is listed (or modprobe btrfs to include the module)?
 thanos: OK.  What does it say when you try and mout your ext4 partition then?
 thanos: what about when you try it from the command line?
 thanos: Try from the command line, it will probably tell you what's wrong
 thanos: sorry I gotta go
 hi all - i am after some help?
 how do you get help here?
 ok, i think this is an old one but i am trying to run 11.04 from usb, i have got further than in the past - but it still wont work!
 well at least i got it to boot from USB but seemed to hang on purple screen, beta 2 worked fine, updated itself and booted me into unity, cannot do it with fnal version
 i have a question about my fonts sizes in kubuntu,  i know this is a ubuntu channel but theres only 1 person in kubuntu talking and he cant help me
 when i boot up kubuntu my font size is huge, much to big to even fit in the text boxes, i forced 96 dpi once in kubuntu which fixed it, but the log on screen is still huge. any ideas?
 anyone have any idea what the problem is?
 anyone know why my fonts are huge on the log on screen, like to big to fit in text boxes? ive forced dpi to 96 to make it workable in kubuntu itself, but the log on screen is still huge. any ideas?
 hmm ok

 the font problem only happens with kde,  gnome and gdm are fine,   kde and kdm are huge
 ive gotten kde to look fine now
 it just kdm
 and it only happen on this monitor
 if i hook up my 22" it looks fine
 this is a 40" @ 1920
 any ideas why my nvidia driver says "activated but not in use" ??
 So, anyone explain ubuntu users and groups (groups part)
 In unity, how is one supposed to set their cpu scaling choices?
 ActionParsnip: What you talking about?  I never back up windows...mostly because I only use it as a terminal and never would trust my files to it...
 ActionParsnip: All my files are kept on external raid 5 arrays, in two seperate locations, the mirrored to my home, and twice more within my work network.
 ActionParsnip: And that's just the live backup.
 Oh, and it's all on unix(&like) systems :)
 ActionParsnip: I know.  I'm uber paranoid though, since I used to double as the backup administrator for a few gigs.
 In Unity+11.04, is there an ubuntu way to set your CPU scaling policy?  I know how to set it in /sys, but I don't want that reset by unity+ubuntu's daemons when/if it feels like it
 Does anyone know if unity-2d is fully supported?
 Asside from some miro annoyances (mostly related to adding items to the bar), it seems much faster.
 ActionParsnip: Theoretically, you could make a UI that required nearly no processing power, by using the graphics card.  There have been _so_ many projects trying to do that... shame they all do pretties instead.
 multipass_: are you talking about a bin and cue file?
 multipass_: 1, you can install adobe reader through apt-get, and maybe even the software center
 multipass_: 2, the only reason to use adobe-reader is if you need to fill out PDF forms.
 multipass_: I don't know, that's not something I've had to do much.  You can try using pdf2text or pdftotext (both should be avialable) to get text out.
