 upgraded to 11.04 and now I get a black screen at boot (under recovery mode I see a bit of scrolling text, then black); ATI Mobility HD3470
 system doesn't appear to respond to any keyboard shortcuts (that I know of)
 michaelschmid, classic view?
 I can't login
 the system locks before I can interact with it
 nope
 michaelschmid, perhaps; may as well salvage the pieces and reinstall if there is no known/easy solution
