 is it just me, or is launchpad totally tits up
 how do i configure the unity panel?
 KrisDouglas, i cant? thats pretty opposite of free as in freedom
 i just want to right click and delete or add
 change the order
 KrisDouglas, pretty much a total fail then, looks like were being pushed to proprietary "use it our way"
 yet published it as the default environment
 how do i install gnome-shell in natty?
 or gnome 3.0 ui
 .....
 so we avoid using the new gnome ui to present our own and then dont even include gnome's?  sounds sketchy
 ohsix, yet it was included in past releases
 ohsix, check that....http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=gnome-shell&searchon=names&suite=maverick&section=all
 gnome-shell = gnome-shell = gnome3
 ohsix, so why isnt gnome-shell in the repos now?
 rgr, thats correct, not having one does not suffice for specialized video setups
 exad, you cant use optimus
 exad, if you have an ATI card there are options for it, but you wont need it really
 exad, i have the m15x and i get about 4 hours on battery which should be more than enough
 exad, so nvidia = no, you just use the nvidia card and set up power saving when youre on battery, should work fine
 exad, when you power up and its on battery, it will automatically go low power, when mine is on battery it does no heating
 exad, short story, youll have little trouble with it and you dont need to worry about optimus
 exad, it will use your nvidia card
 exad, i havent tried natty or maverick on my laptop yet so i dunno how theyll act, currently using lucid
 exad, yes i get about 60 fps in wow and about the same in tf2 with the gt 240m
