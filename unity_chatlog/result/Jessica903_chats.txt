 anyone here know anything about PXE over wireless?
 well, that's part of the question
 I was reading about making a grub boot disk http://wiki.linuxmce.org/index.php/GRUB_PXE_network_boot
 Basically, I wanna boot a static CD with PXE enabled Grub, and then grab my boot image wirelessly.  anyone done this?
 I have a couple of really old intel wireless cards I wanna use instead of throwing them away
 nanog, can you point me in the right direction?  I'm kinda weak here...
 is there any kind of "make boot disk" utility that will add the drivers I select?
 nanog, what about stubborn biatches who wanna learn?
 cool
 u8 and u10 can both ID my old PCMCIA WLAN card, so I have faith I can get it working.
 OH NO!  LINUX ILLEGAL?
 sorry, ziz... couldn't help myself
