 Giles, I think you have to install drivers for your video card
 Giles, I had a problems whit ubuntu starting when I updated to 11.04
 Giles, and then I updated nvidia drives and the Unity started.\
 Giles, it works whit a notice for me I have chose classic desctop
 Giles, whit the massage I have house the "X" button and classic desktop stated
 Giles, then I did update to my nvidia drivers and unity starts, I am not so happy whit this now but :D you know
 Giles, update your drivers manually and restart your PC and Unity will start, it started for me.
 Giles, through nvidia site :D i downloaded it and install it
