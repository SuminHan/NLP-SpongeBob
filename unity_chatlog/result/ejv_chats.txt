 is it out? :)
 has that dreadful power regression been fixed?
 the one phoronix wrote about?
 ohsix: haha it looked pretty convincing, especially with the unlabeled X-axes ;)
 sgaap: :(
 acicula: not sure
 hello, how do I get the menu bar back in gnome-terminal? File, Edit, etc...
 (using Unity)
 there's gotta be a fix
 extraclassic: beats the heck outta me, been using it for 15 minutes lol
 extraclassic: you are correct!
 extraclassic: thx, nice find
 how do i make the unity bar auto-hide
 zachgretzinger: don't see 'setting'
 !away | LW_Away
 ugh this is frustrating lol
 desktop "effects" used to be in appearance menu, where did it go?
 i wanna turn all this garbage off
 people complained each time facebook changed its layout, then people adjust, adapt, and forget, unity will be similar i imagine
 truepurple: think ubuntu has moved to libre office
 how do i enable metacity in unity?
 19 hours? ouch
 that's dedication
 Chaoss: all linux distros support multiple hard drives, why don't you start by: sudo apt-get install pastebinit
 Chaoss: then: sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit
 also...
 !patience | Chaoss
 bazhang: i told him to install it
 bazhang: ;)
 Chaoss: ok so what have you tried, what errors are you getting?
 Chaoss: what's pysdm ?
 Chaoss: i thought you were trying to mount your NTFS partitions...
 Chaoss: i would: sudo mkdir /mnt/mydrive && mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/mydrive
 Chaoss: you can't use sudo? is this your machine?
 Chaoss: it should work ALL the time, it will prompt you for your password you provided during installation.
 Chaoss: ok so what happened?
 Chaoss: mount | pastebinit
 Chaoss: use my name when sending me information: example: ejv: http://paste.ubuntu.com/600598/
 Chaoss: mount shows that your sda2 ntfs partition is already mounted under /media/ folder; the command i sent you earlier, i indicated */dev/sdaX* where X is a number YOU substitute... did you do that?
 tanath / zachgretzinger, enough, take it to #ubuntu-offtopic or ignore eachother, thx ;)
 Chaoss: if you used sudo, and put in your password correctly, the mount operation should succeed.
 Chaoss: double check your `fdisk -l` listing, to make sure it corresponds to your devices you're trying to mount.
 Chaoss: ok, then using the format: `sudo mount <device> <target>` is the next step, where target can be in /mnt/ or /media/ typically.
 Chaoss: your data may or may not reside in another partition on your device, use `fdisk -l` to locate relevant partitions where your data is likely to be stored.

 AnonymousGuy: please check https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+bugs to see if such an issue has been reported. if not, file it for us. :-)
 djazz: of course
 djazz: be more specific.
 Chaoss: you mean you haven't loaded support for it? why didn't you say so?
 Chaoss: i think i've hit my limit in terms of support i can provide for that issue, attempt to setup ntfs support, there's a wealth of documentation online about the process.
 !enter > Chaoss
 gh0st: be much more specific.
 Chaoss: the recent release 11.04 is, you may want to try 10.04 LTS for something more stable
 djazz: ?
 djazz: ahh the launcher issue you mentioned, not sure i understand from the picture, let me look again
 looks normal djazz
 djazz: on mine, yes, not in yours
 rome wasn't built in a day... understanding linux doesn't happen over night either... *sigh*
 im taking a break, you guys wear me out lol, good luck newcomers.
 red2kic: a 25ft hdmi from best buy would cost like $1000 LOL
 red2kic: yup ;)
 solution: go back to windows.
 appearances!???
 ror, the point is that no one has any interest in what your experience was like in windows since this is ubuntu support.
 ror: i believe gnome should also be available as a fall back, should unity not work as intended
 ror: worked perfectly for me, i selected ubuntu classic no effects, because well... i hate effects ;)
 honestly, outside of unity, this new version is anti-climatic....
 Starminn: banshee? agreed, been using for years via the PPA
 Starminn: i don't really know the difference betwen open and libre office, but it sounds merely like licensing...
 if you can push it to stdout, sure

 POOPHAMMMER: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
 lol
 i didn't know u had powerz bazhang
 :p
 lol
 is gnome3 supported here?
 not sure it is...
 dijonyummy: most popular apps will populate the app list with an icon
 why don't you start by providing some vendor/model information
 the help you get is only as good as the detail you provide.
 jetienne: of course.
 jetienne: i suggest joining #vbox for support
 jetienne: type /join #vbox
 ubuntu doesn't support virtualbox. it's offtopic here.
 miceiken: different kernel versions?
