 how can I restore all databases into mysql from one that was backed up via: mysqldump -A --add-drop-table -u root | gzip > $OUTFILE
 https://gist.github.com/951537
 would line 7 work?
 this is a 10.04 LTS issue
 most solutions I see are suggesting http://blog.roberthallam.org/2010/06/sshd-not-running-at-startup/
 start on filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=eth0
 GeorgeJ:  this is a standard bug for 10.04 I think
 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/+bug/216847
 see link :)
 hmm
 thanks
 how to check if a daemon is up?
 ps aux | grep mysqld ?
 hey Drduck :)
 aren't we too peas in a pod :)
 *two
 lol
 GeorgeJ: btw
 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3899 2010-05-19 20:30 /etc/init.d/ssh
 it's executable
 $ no pid to kill
 :p
 one sec :)
 no messages
 I had to reboot the vps container
 well, Xen container
 then the damn container was stuck
 that's when I did sbin/shutdown -r now
 GeorgeJ: different issue
 getting 'Sorry no PTY
 No more PTYs, Sorry, could not find a PTY
 if I do screen on anything
 Cannot open your terminal '/dev/ttyp0' - please check.
 crw-r--r-- 1 appuser tty  3,  0 May 25  2010 /dev/ttyp0
 I changed it from that to 644 and root:root
 any suggestions?
