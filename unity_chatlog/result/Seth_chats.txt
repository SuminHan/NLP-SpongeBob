 Hey! So I need some help with grub
 guntbert: error: symbol not found 'grub_env_export'
 guntbert: Just installed 11.04
 guntbert: yeah
 guntbert: I looked around, and I can fix grub from a live CD, but I'd like to know if it has to be 11.04, or...?

 guntbert: so, I'll just do that with my 10.10 cd. thanks!
 guntbert: okay, thanks!
