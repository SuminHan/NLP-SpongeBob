 hi
 I have trouble finishing installing my ubuntu 11.04 I get this error at the end: Unable to install GRUBB in dev-sda (i created main partition and swap, I also have windows and other partitions on the hdd, totaling 5 partitions)

 jheyes if you dont know chances are you dont have the same motherboard i have :P
 can anyone help me with 11.04?
 m13 I get the error: Unable to install GRUBB in dev-sda when installation is almost complete
 m13: ok :(
 Anyone else know the solutionf or this error: Unable to install GRUBB in dev-sda
 lcawte we ened to know what caused the error
 no idea lol :s are there any logs or something i never used ubuntu for more than 10 mins
 i hope you backed up your system, upgrades come with risks
 zvacet: thanks
 zvacet: the ubuntu installer already performs those commands, I don't think that is the problem
 i have my hdd partitioned in 3 primary partitions, and I want to install ubuntu on the unallocated space left
 but i get this Unable to install GRUBB in dev-sda
 How does WUBI work? does it install ubuntu like if i would use a live cd or does it somehow install it as a simulation actually in windows or something?
 Unable to install GRUBB in dev-sda  help me cant install 11.04
