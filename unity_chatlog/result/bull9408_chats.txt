 I downloaded python while I was attempting to set up Conky, and now my splash screens on startup and shutdown are jacked up, I decided I didn't want to use Conky on this system. Anybody know how I can uninstall python? and Conky?
 Joker_77 I'm not positive what exactly I typed in the terminal :O one second and I'll pull it up
 Joker_77 , I typed in $sudo apt-get install aptitude python-statgrab ttf-droid hddtemp curl lm-sensors conky-all
 $sudo chmod u+s /usr/sbin/hddtemp
 $sudo sensors-detect #answering
 ignore the $ s
 can somebody tell me how to uninstall python
 I had installed it to use conky, however I changed my mind because I don't want conky on this system now. It has messed up splash screens on start up and shut down. and a few other graphical issues
 didn't know synaptic recognized if i installed through terminal
 zizban, good deal, thanks man
 zizban, actually I'm now seeing that I had not downloaded python, it's integral to ubuntu, well, unity...
 zizban, here's the command I put in terminal: $sudo apt-get install aptitude python-statgrab ttf-droid hddtemp curl lm-sensors conky-all
 $sudo chmod u+s /usr/sbin/hddtemp
 $sudo sensors-detect #answering
 ok.
 zizban, any clue about what messed up my splash screens
 zizban, well I'm referring to them as splash screens, the "Ubuntu" screen with the "....." when you are starting up and shutting down. They just kinda go black and do some crazy pixelation, thing. not really sure
 yes
 zizban, says it's unable to find package "autoclean"
 zizban, ok, it ran... well, the command ran without errors.
 zizban, is that all there is to it?
 ok
 anybody have a clue why I can't get my internal microphone to hear anything
 ngc604, the correct input is selected, and not on mute
 but all i'm getting is static
 ngc604, I'm playing with it now, didn't know it was there either
 ngc604, still nothing
 just less static
 ngc604, no vocal sound what so ever
 ngc604, it's an internal mic, and It worked under vista, I have just recently installed Ubuntu on this system, there was a hard drive failure, and this was easier th ian ins
 ngc604, than installing Vista and finding all of the drivers
 ngc604, already checked it, it's correct
 ngc604, my only other option is the HDMI output for hardware
 ngc604, yes, Fujitsu Lifebook A series
 ngc604, yes
 ngc604, I'm going to try that backports solution now, I'll let you know
 ngc604, it said it couldn't find the package when I tried backports solution
 ngc604, actually do I need to replace the 'uname -r' with something?
 ngc604, I installed aumix, but now I can't get it to run, it says. "error opening mixer: No such file or directory"
 ngc604, yes
 ngc604, yes
 ngc604, |spci| ?
 dios_mio, it did the same thing for me. I think i ran          reset --unity         in the terminal
 ngc604, I thought that was a |spci| not lspci.
 ngc604, lspci | grep audio gave no results
 and I don't have a mic to plug in to the 3.5 input
 ngc604, yes
 Eyes_Only, i gotcha, I just read it as (pipe) spci (pipe) instead of an L at the beginning
 yea, bash is what I always used.
 i've been on mac for a while though
 my memory is a tad foggy
 ngc604, it is
 I did
 how do I modify the notification area in 11.04?
 how do I modify the notification area, and panels, in 11.04?
 how do I modify the panels and notification area in 11.04?
 anybody have any idea how to modify the panel, add applets and such, in 11.04??
 bull9408, ok... what is it? haha
 crap
 not in the launcher, I want them on the notification areal
 like my forcequit app, and my weather applet, and things like that, over near the clock and battery and wifi, etc.
 yea... cause you can't right click.
 I can't add a task bar or anything either, I like to modify my panels, but now i can't.
 it's rather annoying
 trism, ughh. that's really annoying.
 i miss my gnome.
 trism, haven't tried it yet. might later. just up-ed to 11.04 today
 trism, yea, i just saw it.
 LittleRed, due to a bunch of completely unrelated issues, I acutally installed a new hard drive today, and in the process installed 11.04
 LittleRed, yes.
 LittleRed, well, I used A live CD, i'm not sure if you are reffering to a specific program
 LucyIntheSky, have you checked ccsm under the Ubuntu Unity settings>experimental>panel transperancy
 LittleRed, I have a Fujitsu with a 64 bit Intel processor, what do you have? how weren't any of them what you were looking for?
 LittleRed, just download Ubuntu 11.04 for 64 bit operating system, mount the .iso to a CD, and voila.
 LucyIntheSky, it should be a tab.
 LittleRed, i didn't update through CD, was a fresh install, I think I updated from a CD a longg time ago, not sure though.
 LittleRed, yup, I still haven't upgraded my other systems yet though.
 LucyIntheSky, make what normal?
 LucyIntheSky, are you still running 10.10
 LucyIntheSky, what exactly is wrong with the panels?
 LucyIntheSky, I wish I could tell you how, but it did the same to me, I suppose they removed all Gnome panels, so I don't have any of mine anymore
 LucyIntheSky, it kinda $*(@)%) me off...
 LucyIntheSky... hmm... I'm not sure what the terminal command is for that, sorry
