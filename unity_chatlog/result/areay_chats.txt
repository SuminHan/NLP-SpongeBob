 just upgraded to natty, but i have no unity -- my desktop hasn't changed at all
 chadi: afaik my video drivers are installed and working correctly. i didn't get a message to say unity wouldn't work
 chadi: also pressing alt+f2 and running unity produces something but it's totally unusable
 and i have to hide my gnome panel to see it
 i just upgraded to natty and i don't have an option to use unity. pressing alt+f2 and running unity brings up an unusable unity, i can see menus but they do nothing
 elxordi: i don't appear to have a unity plugin in compiz. is there a package for that?
 vibhav, i've heard others reporting that they see a message that tells them unity is unsupported. i have seen nothing like this
 vibhav, i get no error at all. i have no option to use unity as an interface. also running unity inside of gnome produces ugly results
 elxordi, unity is installed, but searching for 'unity' in compizconfig returns no results

 vibhav, i've set the top panel to auto-hide
 elxordi, nope, it's not in there :(
 elxordi, it seems that's not my only problem. my sources.list is for maverick even though i've never had maverick installed. i upgraded from lucid to natty
 elxordi, yes please, ty
 velcroshooz, i just used the update manager. it doesn't give an option to choose which release to upgrade to
 vibhav, unknown option: --reset
 i think i broke ubuntu lol
 now do-release-upgrade is upgrading me to natty. even though i'm already theoretically using it
 elxordi, it seems that update-manager is working. i'm gonna let it finish. ty for your help:)
