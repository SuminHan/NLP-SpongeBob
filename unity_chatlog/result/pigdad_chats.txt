 So I started the Ubuntu install CD, pressed "try ubuntu" and nothing happened
 Is that a bad sign?
 Monotoko: It stalled for a long while and just continued showing the window
 Monotoko: I should specify. This is booted into the CD.
 usr13: Hm, I'll do that once I reboot
 Monotoko: The menu didn't show up. I opened a terminal window by switching to a VT and running gnome-terminal
 But yeah, I'll check the disk for integrity. I torrented the iso so chances are it's OK, but maybe it burned wrong
 Monotoko: Correct
 Monotoko: X opened, and stuff runs correctly, the shell just didn't load
