 yes mount it manually and perhaps it can work after a reset, check permissions too
 update-alternatives -config x-www-browser
 update-alternatives --config x-www-browser
 sudo of course

 command msg for what?
 no errors
 0 auto chrome
 1 manual ff
 2 manual chrome

 just got it

 well thanks for that

 I used to have indicators on 10.10 on the pannels how do I get them back? I had temperature sensors and my messages would popup or windows for me to select
 can i still have pannels?
 I can be distracted in a content and forget about things I was doing, that is why I think panels were useful
 now with natty I can't keep track of other things
 how to solve it?
 dropbox icon running does not show either
 skype does but hardly
 also I can't zoom like i used to with the windows key
 it used to zoom the whole desktop in and out
 and now that feature is gone!!!!!!!!!!!!11

 was that compiz or some other?
 how about copying pasting from the terminal with few keystrokes without having to do the ctrl+c +v thing?
 anyone knows how to copy paste from the terminal to elsewhere? I highlight but then what?
 my mouse has not middle click
 or it does the wheel
 ?

 oh yeah it works
 thanks
 the wheel is hard though
 but simpler
 anyone knows how to pastebinit but graphically or to specific service? from a browser or from other editor for instance?
 pastebinit with the less clicks possible
 too many clicks, for instance if I have to select some output from the terminal or a browser
 I don't want to paste it into a document or open a browser page
 but rather directly click and it saves the url on memory to paste
 pastebinit is limited to terminal and sometimes i cannot pipe the output that i want
 I have to save to document first then use the command
 a lot of keystrokes
 example?
 dont you use pastebinit?
 php some command | pastebing does not work!
 hmmm oh thanks ChogyDan, how to change provider, I want pastie.org rather
 rats!
 rats! need to change to pastie.org
 cordoval_: sometimes doing it like this works for me: pastebinit<(command etc etc)
 rats! can someone knows how to change provide for pastebinit?
 to pastie.org or is it hardcoded?
 rats!

 I guess I should choose the option to try ubuntu
 how to go for b

 it has little information
 I already did that
 oh rats sorry required sudo
 sda1 is clean
 sd2 is fsk.ext2 attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while trying to open dev sda2
 could this be a zero-length partition?
 -p would not fix that
 this is serious businsess
 escott: it is sda1 huge amount
 but it says now it is clean
 sda1
 I will check them with gparted since it is gui
