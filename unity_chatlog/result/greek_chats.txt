 Hello. We've made a habit of only using LTS ubuntu server releases. But over the last 5 years, we haven't really leverage LTS in any way directly. Is there any risk to just going straight to 11.04? Or do I benefit by using LTS 10.04 in some way that I don't know about? Thanks.

 ok thanks
 Hello. Is there any way to get a list of installed programs on my ubuntu server? I did a default server install a few years ago and have since installed a couple of programs (ie: OpenSSH server). I'd like to make a list of all the installed programs if possible. Thanks
