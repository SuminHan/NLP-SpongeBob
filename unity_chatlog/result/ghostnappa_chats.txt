 Hey guys
 I have a problem, and a rather specific one
 okay, so on my main PC, various shmup games seem to be uncontrollable. Most think that I am holding up+left, but rrootage just doesn't move at all
 it happens on ubuntu variants, fedora, and every other linux install that I have tried
 so it isn't just ubuntu exclusive

Testing in a liveCD environment between two seperate PC's reveals that this is only a problem with my PC and not the other one. This is a problem with na
 tive games, WINE, and MAME. But seems to only be effecting games with joystick support
 Okay guys, I have a problem. On my main PC, various shmup games seem to be uncontrollable. Most think that I am holding up+left, but rrootage just doesn't move at all. it happens on ubuntu variants, fedora, and every other linux install that I have tried so it isn't just ubuntu exclusive. Testing in a liveCD environment between two seperate PC's reveals that this is only a problem with my PC and not the other one. This
 is a problem with native games, WINE, and MAME. But seems to only be effecting games with joystick support. I honestly have no idea where to start searching for answers here, but thought this could be a decent starting point. I have no joysticks, just using a standard keyboard and mouse
 Oh right, sorry
