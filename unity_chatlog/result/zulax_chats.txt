 unity broke, after enabling desktop cube, i see no panels, no dock....no shortcuts
 all i have access to is desktop icons!
 Dr_Willis, thanks that was so annoying
 Dr_Willis, i dont think the shortcuts(terminal) is still working
 i reset unity and unity is back, but the keyboard shortcuts dont seem to work
