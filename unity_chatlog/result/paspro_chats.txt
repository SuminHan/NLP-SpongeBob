 Question: Gwibber throws notification messages on the screen with twitter/facebook events. However, when I try to click on these notifications I they fade out. Is there any way for them to become clickable?
 M13up: I know that, I was just wondering if I can click directly when the notification message pops up
 bullgard4: I am just wondering if I can click directly on gwibber's pop up notifications to open the gwibber interface directly.
 bullgard4: every time you put the mouse on top of a gwibber notification it fades out and cannot be clicked.
