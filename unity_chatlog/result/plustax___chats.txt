 Im having some trouble. I have xchat open. I clicked minimized and it looks like it closed it but it didnt.
 pfifo, I cant find the option to disable the taskbar icon
 okay I disabled the system tray icon
 now how do I go in and manage the other two open ones and close them individually?
 I notice I cant minimize windows at all with unity. They just disappear.
 Isn't there some sort of window management system?>

 I dragged it there from my app tray to keep
