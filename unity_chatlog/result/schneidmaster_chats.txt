 Hey all, I'm getting a problem with updating my release.  I'd like to upgrade to natty but when I try to check for new updates via the update manager I get this error:
 W:Failed to fetch http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/Release  Unable to find expected entry  (Source/source/Sources in Meta-index file (malformed Release file?)
 , E:Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
 any ideas?
 Hey, does anyone know how to modify application launchers in natty? (ie, change the command)
 HerCury: not really actually.  I just want to modify the Skype launcher so it executes the command "webcamWrapper.sh skype" instead of "skype" (as this is the script I used to solve my inverted-webcam bug)
 I could make a custom launcher but then I just have two launchers in unity
 I figured it out if anyone cares lol.  Themes&tweaks -> main menu lets you edit launcher commands
