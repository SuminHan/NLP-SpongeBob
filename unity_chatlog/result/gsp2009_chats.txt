 good morning folks. Anyone here now running natty, with twinview? is it normal to have the top panel duplicated on both screens?
 Dr_Willis, ok.. thanks.. this is not good news for me..
 NyvenZA, everything else works fine for me it seems. Just a little weird having the panel twice.
 hey there folks. Unity and notifier. Do they play nice? Dropbox, printer, skype. None show up in top panel. Anyone seen this?
 ActionParsnip, deleting .gnome, .gnome2 etc?
 ActionParsnip, nice. Thanks.
 coz_, ssharm200. cool. thanks.
 coz_, ssharm200, ActionParsnip: sweet, I am all fixed up. Thanks again, you made my day alot easier.
