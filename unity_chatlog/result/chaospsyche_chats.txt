 what's the command to remove unity?
 11.04 is buggy andrew
 jep try 10.10
 jep: and your having problems?
 is unity a module of the linux kernel in 11.04 ?
 i'm getting 'artifacts' in my UI and yes I am on 'ubuntu classic(no effects)'
 i upgraded(fresh install) to 11.04
 didn't have this problem with 10.10
 cheapie: yes, why? you have same problem ?
 cheapie: is there a solution ?
 cheapie: let me try that
 why would the flash plugin cause this? doesnt make sense
 vasudan: synaptic ?
 are drivers loaded into the kernel as modules?
 i'm thinking it has something to do with the kernel/module
 because this is a newer kernel version than 10.10
 the default kernel when you install 10.10
 cheapie: should i reboot? no effect so far
 vasudan: you have to use synaptic
 or the terminal
 If I remove unity and reboot I won't be dropped to a command prompt will i?
 a complete removal
 cheapie im using that
 im not fine
 i've got gfx artifacts all over my UI
 graphic artifacts
 blocks lines dots
 openbox?
 vasudan: you used synaptic?
 vasudan: rm <package name> ?
 cheapie: that command didn't work,what did it do ?
 in fact
 it's worse now
 omg now the screen is borked,i cant click nothing,no menu bars
 metatase\
 cheapie: what was the command again? i had to reboot
 cheapie: i have done that,and i am in that now
 that only partly fixes it
 there is something that is causing a conflict with whatever is handling the displaying of the UI
 cheapie: let me show you a screen capture
 cheapie: 11.04 live cd is the same thing
 i dont have this problem on 10.10
 but on 10.10 my wireless usb adapter doesnt work. it works with 11.04 and being as that is the only way i can get on the net i want to use 11.04
 nope,i have a intel 82865g onboard vga
 jockey?
 can someone tell me how to use an older kernel with 11.04
 cheapie: Oh, nah it doesnt say nothing
 cheapie: how do i show you this screen capture of my desktop ?
 it says no proprietary drivers are in use
 cheapie: http://imagebin.org/151416
 cheapie: after 'sudo apt-get update' it is the same. no proprietary drivers in use
 cheapie: done that
 cheapie: how can I use the kernel from 10.10 that is installed by default
 :-(
 you see what I am talking about in the screen capture i showed you though?
 cheapie: what would you say that is?
 can someone help me install an older kernel into 11.04 ?
 cheapie: i don't have this issue with 10.10 but on 10.10 my wireless usb adapter doesnt work. thats why i want to use 11.04
 hiexpo: command to find out?
 hiexpo: dpkg -L | grep linux-image

 hiexpo: dpkg-query: error: --listfiles needs at least one package name argument
 hiexpo: http://pastie.org/1859049  <---output of command
 hiexpo: do you know how to compile a kernel with an added functionality and install it?
 hiexpo: because i want to go back to 10.10 but in 10.10 my wireless usb adapter doesn't work so i want to add that func to the kernel ?
 hiexpo: will my wireless usb adapter work in 10.04 ?
 what is the diff between .04 and .10 ?
 hiexpo: it's a wireless usb adapter and its a 'belkin basic wireless usb adapter '
 hiexpo: it works on 11.04 but not 10.10. haven't tried 10.04
 but why would it work on 10.04 if it doesn't work on 10.10. isn't that an older version ?
 hiexpo: how do i find out?
 what's the command to find out?
 how do i find out what chipset is in my wireless usb adapter
 hiexpo: Bus 001 Device 004: ID 050d:945a Belkin Components
 kjxl9: your wi-fi card probably isn't support
 *supported
 hiexpo: will that work in 10.04
 it's more likely to work the older it is versus if it was new
 hiexpo: i just bought this,my comp didn't have wi-fi out of the box
 hiexpo: ok one sec
