 hey can anybody help me with an ubuntu 11.04 issue?  when running process from a terminal they always run in background and I can't make them switch to foreground
 yakubori: when I run ps it doesn't even show the process I ran
 Jordan_U: nautilus
 Jordan_U: oh, interesting.  Makes sense, thanks.  Do you know how to make nautilus feed me terminal output then?  I need to debug a script.  I don't recall this being hard to do in 10.04
 Jordan_U: thanks, that at least helps me know what to google
 nawk: I installed square via apt-get or something and it works fine
