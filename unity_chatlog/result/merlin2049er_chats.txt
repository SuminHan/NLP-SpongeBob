 hey, just upgraded to narty
 is there a driver for nvidia
 nvidia driver for 11.04?
 470
 gtx470
 k
 does it work well
  sudo apt-get Install nvidia-current doesn't work for me?
 how do i install that
 hey,  i upgraded to 11.04, but it deleted my google gadgets
 is that available for 11.04?
 it's safe but you'll loose some packages
 ie google gadgets
 and you'll have to get your own video driver
 can i get some gadgets for my desktop in 11.04?
 my virtual box and vuze stopped working in 11.04
 ok, now it seems to work
 before it said something about a com error
 ok, i got them both running. maybe i had not enough space on my boot drive
 are there any gadgets for the desktop for 11.04?
