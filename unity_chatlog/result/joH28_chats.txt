 Guys, hello! Does anybody know if Wubi will not conflict with GRUB2? I have Meerkat installed but I'd like to try Natty on Wubi install. I also have it on VBox, but would like to see the difference on Wubi.
 Anybody has installed Natty on Wubi while dual-booted to  Windows and Ubuntu Meerkat/Lynx? Will it not conflict with GRUB2?

 CignoNero, thanks. So it wil not write to the MBR yes?
 arvut, 2GB SWAP is fine for using hibernate and suspend. As far as bigger goes, not if you are running too man apps that the 2GB is used up Linux will start using swap.
 CignoNero, OK. I guess that's it. Gonna try Natty soon. Thanks!
 mindkeep, the launcher is the app dock in one the way the designed it.
 user82, yes you can but fstab is the recommended way to do it
 LHR_crew, 10.10 with the netbook edition?
 LHR_crew, you sure it was not upgrade?
 LHR_crew,  I think you've upgraded to 11.04. On mine it gave me that prompt too.
 LHR_crew, I didn't. I'm staying on 10.10. I'll wait for 11.10 before I upgrade. :D
 arvut, Well yeah, but can you still suspend/hibernate on an 8GB RAM with less swap? Mine always complains swap is not sufficient. Never tried to check if there was a way around that. :)
 LHR_crew, I'm afraid there is no rollback option save for reinstalling 10.10 (somebody correct me if I'm wrong). However if you have /home on a separate partition, it shouldn't be too hard.
