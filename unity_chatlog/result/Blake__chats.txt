 I can ask for support in here correct?
 Alright well yesterday I updated from 10.10 to 11.4 and it didn't boot so I went to grub and choose my previous kernel,but couldn't change my boot order. Then I went into Ubuntu 10.10 Live CD no internet access.
 Added a partition installed it and no internet connection.
 I ran a command and it sees my card, but I can't get it to work.
 Did anyone read what I said?
 Is there any Ubuntu Techs here? or anyone that can help me.
 Can someone help me?
 Aj00200: I did. I shall restate again. I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.4 and it wouldn't boot. Now Ubuntu isn't finding my Ethernet connection.
 ActionParsnip: It sticks on the splash
 ActionParsnip: But its the -pae the one without it works.
 ActionParsnip: I rather get ethernet working then 11.4 to boot
 ActionParsnip: Well I could, but it worked before and why not now?
 ActionParsnip: Well I should add it's on my Motherboard and I have the disk and for Linux it tells me to update the Kernel.
 ActionParsnip: I not quite sure if I follow. I created a partition installed 10.10 booted into that 10.10 partition. And it doesn't work when I used the exact same disk to install it before.
 ActionParsnip: I did, but I didn't like it so I created a partition and put 10.10 back on there. Because I have 200GB of movies and music and stuff that I don't want to re-do.
 ActionParsnip: You didn't forget about me did you? I know it's busy, but just making sure.
 ActionParsnip: Before No. Now yes.
 ActionParsnip: I lied I don't dual boot ubuntu and Windows it just ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.4
 ActionParsnip: ...
 hiexpo: I am being serious. I don't have Windows on that computer.
 I am back.
 Tried some more to fix my problem, but failed.
 I can't get my RealTek RTL8111/8168B to work. Can anyone help me?
