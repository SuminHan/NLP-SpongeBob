 Hello there... I just had my computer crash when updating the new version... I try to boot but it telles me it cant mount the drive
 what can I do to recover ubuntu?
 zvacet: My computer froze during installation and I rebooted, not it says it can't find the drive
 zvacet: do you think reinstalling ubuntu would allow me to finish the upgrade without having to lose my files?
 Is there a way to continue the upgrade after your system crashes
