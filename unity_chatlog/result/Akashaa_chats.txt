 hi! I'm installing Ubuntu 10.10 LTS on a new MSI cx623. it has freedos installed only. at the installation my hard drive is not recognised. I've tried the "pci=nomsi" option that I've found on the net, but it did not work. Could someone help me, please?
 I've change AHCI mode of SATA hard drive to IDE for installation, but this changed the CD driver too. Thus my CD is not recignised. What can I do?
