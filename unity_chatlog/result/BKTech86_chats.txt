 hi, my computer won't boot windows or ubuntu, can someone help me ?
 i had windows 7 and ubuntu side by side for a long time, windows 7 requested a repair operation and I let it do so, it then made my hard drive unbootable at all (i assume grub is gone) using guide to restore grub has not worked, please help thanks
 KNUBBIG: using guides to restore grub has not worked
 can anyone help me restore grub please?  I've tried using grub-install on my linux partition, but it doesn't work
 KNUBBIG: with CD yea
 !chroot
 KNUBBIG: sorry, i don't follow.  purge what?
 KNUBBIG: while booted from CD?
 KNUBBIG: you're saying to use chroot after mounting my real linux partition and then install grub there?
 KNUBBIG: you don't think apt-get knows where the real / is?
 arand: i mounted my linux partition and did a grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda
 arand: it said it was successful, and i see a grub folder in my linux partition/boot/
 KNUBBIG: isn't apt-get different than other programs though?
 arand: the hard disk won't boot at all
 arand: right
 arand: yes
 hi, I can't boot my disk - i used to dual boot win7/ubuntu and now i've restored grub and checked using a script that everything is correct in the MBR, etc. but the disk won't boot -- i can mount it from a live cd boot and all that - read/write, but it won't boot
 I also can't boot from "boot from first disk option" of the live cd, -- does anybody know what could be preventing this disk from booting?
 can anyone help me get my harddrive to boot again please? windows7 repair screwed it up
 escott: yes
 escott: i have no clue but the disk is not bootable
 escott: mountable, readable, writable, but not bootable
 escott: i ran some boot_info_script.sh
 escott: it said the mbr is in /dev/sda and points to my linux partition where grub is successfully installed blah blah
 escott: i'm pretty sure grub is there in the boot folder
 escott: but if that's not enough, can you guide me through this chroot thing?
 escott: btw, grub-install said Installation successful.  No errors reported.
 escott: ok i'm almost there
 escott: ther
 escott: by "if you have a boot partition" you mean if i have a separate partition solely for the "boot" folder, right?
 escott: my boot folder is in /dev/sda5/boot -- so it's not a separate partition
 escott: sda1 is my windows partition
 escott: should i not do sudo grub-install /dev/sda5?
 escott: ok
 escott: /proc/devices: fopen failed: No such file or directory a bunch of times
 escott: then "Is device mapper driver missing form kernel?
 escott: Failed to set up list of device-mapper major numbers, then more of the 1st error a bunch of times
 escott: then "Installation finished. No error erported." <-- lol
 escott: should we have?
 escott: btw i have no idea what that means
 escott: should re-do the grub-install command now?
 escott: right, no errors
 escott: i didn't upgrade!
 escott: ok will do
 escott: no dice
 escott: correcvt
 escott: is that an acryonym for all of the cursewords going through my mind atm?
 escott: trying now...
 escott: Blue1: i tried using the check disk utility from live cd
 escott: said there were no errors
 escott: is that equivalent to fsck?
 escott: could it be something in the bios?
 escott: i believe i put everything back to normal but .. ?
 escott: i have win7 on sda1
 escott: and ubuntu on sda5
 escott: theres like a swap partition
 escott: sda2 is like a folder that holds sda5 and sda ...
 escott: some others
 escott: sda2 is extended sda5 is ext4
 escott: yeah exactly, the machine doesn't recognize my hard disk as bootable
 escott: with what
 escott: i'm looking at my ext4 partition in disk utility
 escott: and i went to "Edit partition" and the bootable check box is not ticked
 escott: not to grub, but to the bios right?
 escott: sda1 is marked as bootable
 escott: isn't grub installed on the disk?
 escott: where is the mbr in the bios?
 escott: but it seems like the problem is that the bios doesn't even try to look at grub
 escott: btw, this disk utility is hanging in applying those bootable flags
 escott: any idea why?
 escott: none of the partitions are mounted
 escott: do you know how from cli?
 escott: all of it?
 escott: i have an intel core2 duo, sort of old intel motherboard,
 escott: yes 1 disk
 escott: how can i take off the bootable flag from a partition
 carandraug: i did sudo fdisk /dev/sda; a; 5; w;
 carandraug: it said unable to reload device settings or something like that -- new table will be used at reboot
 just booted into ubuntu.......
 FINALLY --
 escott: i didn't even have a chance to see if grub showed up
 escott: yep, it shows up, and the windows option is there too
 phew
 carandraug: problem . finally. solved.
 thank you sooooo much both of you...
 escott: i don't think the bios even attempted to access the mbr because the partition wasn't marked as bootable?
 escott: of course i am way in over my head lol
 is it possible to change the permissions of an external drive that is currently not letting me write to it because "file system is read-only" ??
 Juest: how?
 Juest: ohhh i think i know
 Juest: ok, i'm apparently not using mount right, do you know how?
 Juest: I tried mount -t hfsplus /dev/sdb1 /media/drive
 Juest: but it still says cannot create dir, readonly filesystem
 NictraSavios: i kinow how to use mount basically, but not to fix this problem of a read-only filesystem
 NictraSavios: hfs+
 NictraSavios: well i wrote the stuff thats on it, now all of a sudden it became this way i dont konw how though
 escott: yeah i did that command too, but it has to be writable because i wrote to it in the first place
 hi, how can I add an entry to grub 2?
 does anyone know how to add an entry manually to grub2?
 Dr_Willis: how do i know which hdX,X to use, given my partition is /dev/sda2?
 Dr_Willis: nvm, found the info thanks
 when i boot up ubuntu on my laptop with live cd, the load screen looks normal, with good resolution, but when i boot from disk, it is all pixelated and the screen flickers a few times -- what's with that?
 I installed Windows 7 on /dev/sda5, successfully reinstalled grub, but grub doesn't detect the windows7 installation there
 how can i fix this?
 my ubuntu splash screen is messed up at bootup (pixellated, flickers), but it doesn't happen when i boot with livecd, how can I fix this?
