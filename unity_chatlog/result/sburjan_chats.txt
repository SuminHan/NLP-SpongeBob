 hello. How can I enable unity after installing display drivers ?
 escott: I have nothing in the login screen. I can only shut down computer, restart, etc ...
 escott: unity --replace doesn not work. I get a "Cannotregister panel shell: there is already one running." But my theme is like windows 95
 escott: Interface looks exactly like the previous ubuntu. It has a windows 95 feeling also
 escott: all I have in the login screen is Universal Access Preferences
 escott: I logged off :)
 Elssha: yes. I have selected Ubuntu. What should I select in order to enable Unity ?
 Elssha: I typed, now I have several options. Ubuntu is the selected one and I still got windows 85 :)
 85, 95, you get the picture
 I'm gonna reinstall
 too bad Unity doesn't work on VmWare :(
 is there any way I can use Unity in 2D if I don't have proper hardware acceleration ?
