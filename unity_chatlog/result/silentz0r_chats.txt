 hello, i just upgraded to natty (11.04) and my laptop has been behaving weirdly. The shutdown promt pops up and shuts down after 50 seconds even if I press cancel a million times, and now the laptop doesn't even boot up (i press the power button and it starts for 2 seconds, then dies instantly).
 anyone? I really need my laptop to be on at least.
 botcity: had 10.10, the system upgrade popped up, I pressed upgrade
 nope, laptop was untouched
 lcb: nothing, laptop doesn't boot. If I unplug the power and plug it back in, it boots for 2 seconds with a blank screen and then it's off
 lcb: same thing happened yesterday but it booted somehow after 2 hours of trying to boot
 lcb: nope
 lcb: I did get it, but the thing is nothing shows up
 lcb: just a blank screen for less than a second
 lcb: then it dies
 lcb: Acer Timeline X 4820 TG
 lcb: looked up the thread on ubuntu forums as well, nothing mentioned
 lcb: furthermore, when I unplug and replug the power supply, it start automatically!
 lcb: this would inquire BIOS to start
 lcb: but BIOS doesn'
 lcb: i tried holding it down for 5 secs, gonna try 20
 botcity: i can put it on my flash drive
 lcb: doesn't boot up with the battery on
 lcb: it's crazy, it boots up on it's own when there's no battery
 lcb: nothing was wrong until I upgraded
 lcb: and as I told you, the shutdown prompt was up and I even if I selected cancel it would promt me again
 lcb: and eventually shut down
 lcb: no, i remove the cord and the battery, then plug the cord and it boots up
 lcb: ofc it doesn't boot with no power source :P
 lcb: I wouldn't complain AT ALL if that was happening :D
 lcb: yes, can't
 lcb: it doesn't go as far as BIOS
 lcb: just a second, maybe less, of blank screen
 lcb: i tried DEL as well
 lcb: to enter BIOS settings. Nothing works
 lcb: it looks as if the BIOS doesn't even load
 lcb: nope
 lcb: I hope so, I really like ubuntu and don't wanna go back to g4y M$
 IdleOne: that's why I used the non existant word g4y.
 lcb: know that
 IdleOne: you never know the intent, unless the author tells you what the intent is.
 IdleOne: I get what you're saying, but I have a quite big issue and you point out something completely irrelevant which doesn't help.
 lcb: he probably won't, as I said a bad word while in a bad situation.
 lcb: ah, nvm
