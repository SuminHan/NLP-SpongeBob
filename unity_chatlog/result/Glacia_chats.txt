 i really need help figuring out why my top of the line computer is failing to run a steam game like it did in windows
 even with wine or playonlinux
 Herbs, even with wine or playonlinux. the Playonlinux is what steam says to use
 can wine or some program be used to play WoW?
 Maahes, link to the wiki please?
 can someone explain to me why i cant get an .exe to open in wine?
 its a trainer for a game... basically editting roms
 buhman, i dont understand what you mean by output?
 well when i tell wine to open it, it just sits there thinking and then stop
 no pop ups or anything
 .... nvm im just going to reload windows tomorrow... i am too stupid for linux
 heron, i have ubuntu unleashed 10.04 and 10.10
 i think i am still going to reload windows and just dual boot until i get a full hang of ubuntu
