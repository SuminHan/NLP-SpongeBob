 upgraded to 11.04 on virtualbox, got guest additions installed. My unity icons appear to be scaled 32x32 icons, and all the fonts are blocky. anyone else run into this?
 Anyone have any thoughts on fixing all of unity looking really blocky?
 unity looks terrible. gigantic icons, very blocky. anyone else see this?
 zvacet: anything that can be done about it?
 zvacet: yeah, if it would just not try to scale that would be fine
 zvacet: installed compizconfig-settings-manager, and changed the icons from 48 to 32... not blocky anymore
 zvacet: now I just have to figure out how to get the fonts to not look like... uh. crap.
 zvacet: compiz is required for unity. you have to go into the settings manager and you can change the icons to their actual size
 zvacet: apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager, run ccsm in terminal, in the filter, search for unity, go to experimental, and change launcher icon size from 48 to 32
 anyone know how to modify unity so it doesn't do font scaling?
 anyone know a way to disable font scaling in unity? my title bar is really screwed up, everything looks 8 bit
 n3glv: @ login screen, select ubuntu classic
 n3glv: if classic doesn't work, try  classic without effects, had to to get it to work on an old machine.
 m3t4lukas: apparently, a bot that is designed to irritate people.
 Caly: It's not really making it easy
 Caly: a lot of people have had frozen installers, and unity doesn't work for a lot of people,
 Caly: so, while it works great when installed fresh, upgrades are really not pleasant right now.
 Caly: What I'm oding... come in here, post your problems, and hope someone has some ideas.
 Caly: yeah,  with the tiny amount of bandwith that people are getting for the install, its not cool that we all get it so fast.
 anyone know how to disable compiz font scaling?
 Mahjongg: yeah, I'd give it a few weeks at the least
 howard: had the same thing on a couple of boxes, retried 5-10 times, finally worked. the servers are pretty heavily loaded. :)
 howard: not really, sometimes it flashed up a note about not being able to contact the server, other times, nothing.
