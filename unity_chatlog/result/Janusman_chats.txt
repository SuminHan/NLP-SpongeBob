 Can I update a WUBI 10.10 into 11.04?
 Belinrahs, thanks =)
 Belinrahs, didn't see anything mentioning WUBI there though.. but I guess it'll work (backing up first) =)
 Belinrahs, awesome. Thanks
 mirrors?
 so if I already have the alternate ISO image, how long should I expect for an upgrade to take?
 julian__, just ask =)
 julian__, I think you should get the compiz manager
 julian__, look at "Install Compiz Config Settings Manager" under http://www.techdrivein.com/2011/04/12-things-i-did-after-installing-new.html
 anyone using dual monitors have any issues with 11.04? asking before I upgrade.
 Just upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 (I'm on WUBI) however, uname -r says I'm still using an older kernel... how do I use the new one?
 (also, on boot time the boot menu didn't show the new kernel)
 larstorben: you mean, instead of upgrading I should reinstall everything? =)
 ActionParsnip: yes, in fact it was there before running sudo update-grub, it's there after. I'll reboot and see if it shows.
 thanks
 ActionParsnip: I'm finding I have to manually edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg to have the new kernel in the boot menu... hoping that works (again; I'm using wubi)
 anyone have problems with the "Dim others" compiz plugin? Mine just quits working sporadically
 is there a way to tell ubuntu to always set the CPU speed to max?
 LAcan: what? I did it in under a minute =)
