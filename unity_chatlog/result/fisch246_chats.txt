 any common issues in Natty i should keep out for or fix?
 how do you upgrade to 10.10 on Ubuntu server?
 o btw i'm using Ubuntu Server 10.04
 found my issue
 solution is found here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/upgrade
 alright so upgraded to natty on the server... and now i can't read the text anymore... i upgraded by doing "do-release-upgrade" did i do something wrong? is there a way to fix this?
 acicula: yes, i did not use SSH
 no ideas then?
 i only get visual issues when using it remotely... which is fun unless i want to upgrade again
 fine*
 well i'll post on the forums then i guess
