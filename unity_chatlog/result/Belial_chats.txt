 i did
 bc81, mine upgraded ok, but i felt it could have been a bit faster.
 kaie, FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
 kaie, you still using elementary?
 i did an upgrade from ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04 and unity worked fine. i just did a clean install of 11.04 and now it's telling me i can't run unity on my system and it defaults to classic.
 Kron, i have an optimus laptop (intel switchable to nvidia) but that doesn't work.
 it always uses the intel chip which worked fine when i used unity after upgrading from 10.10
 for some reason the clean install doesn't run it.
 Kron, yeah, i've read on all that. it's just weird that if i install 10.10 first and then do an upgrade to 11.04, unity works.
 but i wanted to try a clean install.
