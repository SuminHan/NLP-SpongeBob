 Hi, I'm about to install the latest Ubuntu as a virtual machine on my 64 bit windows 7 computer. Should I install the 64-bit or 32-bit version of Ubuntu? Is 64-bit as stable as 32? I'm just looking for what would be fastest and most stable.
 Belinrahs okay thank you :)
 nit-wit I'll start out with 64-bit. :)
 TimeDude yes I figured as much. Wonder if there even are any benefits in using 64-bit on a vm though
 zvacet but I have more than 3gb available for the vm :)
 Hi, how do I switch from the classic ui to Unity on the login screen? I can't find any button of the sort
 How come my top bar is all grey and boring? Is obsidian-coloured and cool-looking right after I log in, then it flickers and changes to the old boring one.
 I was playing around with compiz and somehow managed to disable the top bar and all gui elements except the icons on the screen when in Unity mode. Many keyborard-shortcuts don't work either, like bringing up the console. Help me, how can I fix this?
 KNUBBIG good idea
 KNUBBIG okay, I will try that next. Resetting the compiz settings didn't help
 KNUBBIG, thanks mate, that did it :)
 Hmm, the "Places" and stuff that are supposed to show up when you hover the mouse over the top bar doesn't show up for me.
 Is Unity configurable in any way? Right clicking doesn't work and I haven't found anything in the settings yet
 milen8204 the dropdown box to switch to classic is at the bottom of the screen after you've typed in your password
 is it possible to move the ubuntu bar from top to the bottom?
 Is it possible to use Ubuntu Classic with the Unity color scheme?
 For me it keeps the dark gray color scheme for about 10-15 seconds after login, and the switches over to the oldschool plain light grey one.
 audacity
 so anyone know why it is switching back to the light grey colour-scheme after a few seconds?
 I don''t get why themes don't apply for me. I can select themes in the appearance preferences, and only that window changes. The application bar and all other windows have a plain grey skin. This is in ubuntu classic

 http://imgur.com/P47aa <- Does anyone know why I get this light grey theme? For about 10 seconds after I login I have the standard dark theme, but then it switches over to this :(
 I figured out how to fix the problem with the scheme turning light grey. I have to run "killall gnome-settings-daemon ; gnome-settings-daemon" after every login. Now my question is, how can I automate this?

 Hi, Im trying to configure the thumb buttons for my mouse on Ubuntu 1104. Using xinput set-button-map <device> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 doesn't add number 6 and 7. What am I doing wrong?
