 why isn't Ubuntu 11.04 installer seeing any operating systems on my hard drive?
 Why can't the Ubuntu installer see my partition layout even though "fdisk -l /dev/sda" sees it just fine?
 Owner: yeah, parted gives me an error "Can't have overlapping partitions"
 oh cute, Firefox crashes when I try to look up something in hte Google bar
 you know what else is sad: from the live-boot mode, Firefox crashes when you try to access either Google or Bing
 magicianlord: what, do you want a gdb dump?
 Owner: how can I resolve the problem of overlapping partitions?
 oh my god... is Ubuntu considering the "Extended" partition to be overlapping with the partitions contained within itself
 I think it is
 "Could not launch GParted: failed to launch child process "gksu""
 uh oh
 maybe everything's broken because of my installion media
 I'll go try and re-burn onto a different disk
