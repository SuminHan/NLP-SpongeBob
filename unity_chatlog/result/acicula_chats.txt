 next LTS is 12.04
 escott: hes not trying to crossfire
 brisky83: you may have to run xorg  on each card, so no unified desktop
 brisky83: http://superuser.com/questions/257676/ubuntu-3-monitors-2-video-cards-not-working , seems you can get away with just running one xserver.
 brisky83: i remember using xinerama before, it can be a bit fiddly and dont know if you can configure it using a desktop wizard either, so can be a bit fiddly
 oh is natty released?
 no there isnt
 LTS just means its supported for a longer period, and supposedly a little more stable then the usual intermediary versions
 next LTS is 12.04
 Monotoko: it should work just fine
 Monotoko: windows probably will need a reinstall/reactivation yeah
 Monotoko: just try first and see what happens
 [dlp]: filter all the channel events and its easier to read
 Monotoko: nope, but you can run it using the wine program
 !wine | Monotoko look here,
 Monotoko: WoW doesnt run in wine? it has platinum support afaik
 Monotoko:  http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=20549 look here
 Monotoko: did you install any hardware drivers using the hardware driver tool?
 Monotoko: what gpu do you have?
  Monotoko hmm that should be able to run it just fine
 Monotoko: idk, it may require some fiddling to get it work properly, check the winehq thread/ubuntu forums, pretty sure there are a fair few wow users in the ubuntu community
 !patience
 echo2: does the metacity window manager work within vmware?
 Monotoko: what do you have now?
 echo2: what does not work with the unity manager in vmware?
 BinaryMan: do we need to consult our crystal ball, or is this a random guess
 BinaryMan: if its production, test first
 BinaryMan: do you need to ugprade for any reason at all?
 BinaryMan: sandy bridge processor?
 ninjai: just press screenshot or shift-screenshot
 ninjai: prtscr or whatever abbreviation of printscreen your keyboard uses
 ninjai: just edit the screenshot with gimp
 ninjai: the screenshot makes a screenshot at the resolution of the desktop, you can just edit it from there?
 ninjai: dunno if there is a program that lets you do that, you can hold shift or ctrl to modify what section printscreen captures though
 phoenixsampras: slow download speed?
 skulltip: irssi
 Shoogy: ssh/putty or vnc
 Shoogy: do you want a terminal or graphics
 heu servers and graphical stuff?
 Shoogy: enable remote desktop under system->preferences and then you can connecgt via vnc
 blit: you can but its not needed, if you experience no issues i would not bother
 the67pc: you want to lock your screen?
 the67pc: tried clicking on lock screen instead of logout/halt?
 the67pc: top right corner
 uofm49426: eh, that does not compute
 ejv: isnt that for a newer kernel?
 NickUK`: just right click an iso and select burn?
 sam555: uptime will tell you when it last restarted
 sam555: but syslog or messages will probably log restart mssges
 uofm49426: oh you want to increase the amount of video memory available
 uofm49426: eh, you can set that in the bios for integrated graphics i would think, maybe look at what its set at there? are you sure you can even set it higher then 8Mb?
 ryankask: yeah you can
 how do i enable ecryptfs for an existing user
 [dlp]: thats ok
 [dlp]: i just want to enable ubuntus default ecryptfs where it mounts .Private on login in the users home directory
 [dlp]: eh k, got a linky somewhere or something?
 ohsix: will that setup an encrypted home dir or just an encrypted Private directory
 [dlp]: you need pam_enc to be installed probably to integrated mounting the ecryptfs on login
 ohsix: the ubuntu default these days is to mount ecrypt fs on the users home which is what i want
 ohsix: its been that way for a few releases
 ohsix: maybe you are confused? im not talking FDE, but the entire home is encrypted, not just /home/user/Private
 k_89: yes
 LjL: err, nvm
 k_89: no it stays there unless you reinstall and format
 [dlp]: ecryptfs is not an authentication mechanism
 [dlp]: ohsix ecryptfs-setup-private comes with a -a -all-home flag which setups an encrypted home, which is what i wanted
 ohsix: best review how ecryptfs is setup on current ubuntu, the entire home is the default as of 9.10
 ohsix: i dont see why that is dumb
 [dlp]: ohsix ive been using ecryptfs without problems for years, i was just curious about how to enable it for a user that did not use ecryptfs before
 ohsix: if you install ubuntu it will ask you if you want an ecrypted home, it uses ecryptfs to set that up and encrypts your entire home. ecrypfs-setup without the home flag defaults to the Private directory
 ohsix: http://karuppuswamy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screenshot8.png
 see toggle for encrypt my home directory
 been there since 9.10
 escott: i wasnt planning on switching
 ohsix: all i wanted to know was how to enable ecryptfs so ubuntu can mount it on login really
 it seems that setup-encryptfs-private with the home flag or ecrypfs-home-migrate will setup the encrypted home directory
 geekyogi: you can not downgrade unfortunately, only reinstall
 kyo22: it means the keyboard layout
 kyo22: try the default
 ohsix: rubber hose key discovery is a purely ubuntu-offtopic thing
 kyo22: when in doubt use the default one
 ohsix: bad advice to do what?
 Soothsayer: upgrading can be done using the update-manager
 Soothsayer: booting the installer from usb/cd will make it (re)install rather then update i should think
 Soothsayer: eh yeah you can add the cdrom as a source in software sources, dunno if thats enough to let you upgrade though
 typhoon: what are you trying to do?
 !offtopic
 compdoc: you mean the kernel services?
 phoenixsampras: can you frame that as a support question
 compdoc: err im not familiar with boot-up manager. the services you mentioned sound familiar but are you experiencing an actual problem or just wondering why they are not appearing anymore?
 Eathuz: eh the type should be Linux, the bootloader files go on the linux partition, but you can install the bootloader to the first disk
 !dualboot| Eathuz look here as well
 hypetech: yes but you have to use the alternative installer
 hypetech: you can only setup encrypted home directories via the gui installer
 hypetech: theres a few pages about it on the ubuntu i think, its not too hard to setup but can be a bit of a hassle
 skulltip: nope
 bashelina: should be
 hypetech: set a decent password and enable the encrypted home option, that should keep most people out
 kyle__: by just asking your question
 ohsix:if you would like to discuss security with me do it in offtopic or ##security, not here
 ohsix: please dont harass volunteers, recommending encrypted home and setting a good password is a perfectly acceptable recommendation
 ohsix: when people enable the encrypted home they get a big warning about just that and how to recover their data in case of problems
 ohsix: again i would like to suggest ##security or offtopic as the venue to continue this discussion
 unity
 ohsix: ?
 shmoolikipod: you can select the ubuntu classic environment at the login prompt
 shmoolikipod: that should give you the old look
 do you want something that serves pages or one that integrates rendering java,php or we?
 macs you can try lighthttpd, but 78Mb used doesnt seem like a lot
 zeleftikam, best to remove those drivers you installed
 zeleftikam,  you installed drivers from the realtek site right
 zeleftikam, is there some tutorial specific for your hardware that you are following that suggested that?
 CoachJ, System->preferences->display
 or monitors
 zeleftikam, eh wipe, reinstall and troubleshoot with the existing drivers
 CoachJ, yeah try monitors
 zeleftikam, can you give me the specific model of the card?
 zeleftikam, if you dropped in hardware drivers without a way of removing them properly any form of trouble shooting is somewhat pointless if your system uses some external drivers.
 zeleftikam, if you type lspci in a terminal can you paste the line that contains Audio
 zeleftikam, "lspci | grep Audio" will also give you the line i am looking for
 zeleftikam thats not a realtek device
 zeleftikam, can you post the entire output of lspci on pastebin?
 zeleftikam, there is no realtek chip in that list
 zeleftikam, you can see a chip on the motherboard that has realtek stamped on it?
 zeleftikam, can you check the bios to see if this is enabled?
 escott, you mean the realtek chip identifies as intel_hda?
 zeleftikam, escott  well i did find this : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1729039
 zeleftikam, but you have to revert back to ubuntu default and getting rid of any additional drivers you added, even if that means reinstalling ubuntu. It only takes 30 minutes anyway
 zeleftikam, from what i can gather you need to specifiy the model type for the snd_intel_hda
 zeleftikam, it is, most of the time
 escott, i see people reporting that that works? would you suggest something else?
 escott, ie like this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4263007#post4263007
 escott, well you have to edit a file in /etc/modprobe.d and add the specfic model option for snd-hda-intel
 escott, which is not very user friendly i admit, but the problem seems to lie in the hardware not reporting its type properly so it cant be autodetected?
 escott, we dont need those standards anyway, heh :/
 vademecum, if its still fetching, yes, if its installing no
 FanControl, you are not root
 zeleftikam, what i found is this http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=4079102&postcount=11 and the followup post. From what i understand changing that /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base file with the right model is all thats required
 zeleftikam, the followup post suggests 6stack-dig model, so id start with that, but youll have to experiment a little
 zeleftikam, oh hey, there is an entire list of alc880 models, eh i guess some guessng is required :)
 FanControl, maybe modprobe has a verbose flag
 Failrar, whats your command line again
 escott, thanks for that
 pfifo, its called taskset
 FanControl, whats your command for loading the module?
 pfifo, idk, try reading the mapage
 *man page
 pfifo, nope never used it
 Fancontrol, no try modprobe acerhdf
 FanControl, hmm, well its not being descriptive about why it fails, maybe there is something in dmesg?
 FanControl, are you sure it should be loadable to begin with
 PaidSupport, youd better put that question to canonical support/sales directly
 FanControl, did you custom build the kernel module or?
 crus, there is a script that generates it
 crus, lets see if i can find it
 crus, good question!
 crus, still looking, heh
 crus, man update-motd
 FanControl, it seems that is the cause for your error
 FanControl, so your specific model is not, yet at least, supported by that driver
 PaidSupport, can you adjust the backlight at all using the function keys?
 PaidSupport, are you saying the backlight is completely off, or just set really low
 PaidSupport, ie if its off you have to shine a light at your screen to make out anything at all
 sweb, xubuntu 10.04 perhaps, or something specially trimmed like lubuntu
 sweb, nah, ubuntu netbook is just normal ubuntu with a different gui, same minimum hardware reqs too
 Gnea, yes but thats not really relevant here, hes just wondering if it will use less ram, which it wont
 Gnea, didnt they drop the netbook edition altogheter as of 11.04?
 diglett, you can set routing options under network preferences
 right click the network applet and then select edit connections, then find your connection and edit it. it should have a tab where you can edit routes
 Hoyt, alernative installer supports lvm
 Cairo|Mac, if i had to guess it looks like the smb configuration file is corrupt
 Gnea, it may be that it green lights, but those keywords look like they came from smb.conf
 Cairo|Mac, try purging samba and then installing samba again?
 both
 think the default aready is samba 4 so shouldnt have to specify that or
 Cairo|Mac, are you sure it did not just prompt you as to what it should do with the configuration file?
 Cairo|Mac, probably not
 Cairo|Mac, though as Gnea pointed out it may still be starting samba given it shows a green light
 Cairo|Mac, idk, does purging and reinstalling solve the problem?
 litropy, you mean to add the medibuntu repositories?
 well they are just addon packages for the most part, so i dont see why you should run into problems
 fisch246, doing a remote upgrade?
 Cairo|Mac, weird, do you have some custom samba packages or other samba packages on the system?
 Cairo|Mac, Well the errors are related to the configuration file, either the purging didnt reinstall the maintainers version or the maintainers version is corrupt. Any reason why you are using samba4 instead of the samba default?
 Cairo|Mac, nope, you have to explicitly enable samba4
 Cairo|Mac, its worth a try
 Cairo|Mac, whats the error
 Cairo|Mac, having them both installed does explain it a little
 Cairo|Mac, thats a different and unrelated error
 Cairo|Mac, id start looking in syslog or messages to see what that is about
 aphexcoil, i've not needed to do that
