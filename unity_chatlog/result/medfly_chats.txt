 hi, where does ubuntu normally mount a CD?
 I am trying to mount an iso as a CD so that wine recognizes it by default :-D
 thankyou
 Stereocaulon_: sigh, doesn't seem to have the result I expected
 Stereocaulon_: I have an ISO of a game. I want to open it up with wine.
 Stereocaulon_: I mounted it with -o loop... what else must I do
 it works that way
 wine just doesn't recognize it :p
 Dr_Willis: ah, okay, I think I found where
 hey!
 it works! ^_^
 Stereocaulon_: I was about to say no, but it does now.
 Stereocaulon_: diablo 2 :P
 Dr_Willis: it's okay, I just mounted it with -o loop and told wine it's a CD.
