 Upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10, 2 display machine, about 2 days after upgarde i log into machine and 2nd display retains the login screen wallpaper with no menu bars. I can move the mouse into that screen but cant do anything (right click doesnt work either)
 other profiles can see the 2nd screen fine
 starZ right click and add more rows
 2nd display wont work properly on one of my login accounts, where should i start looking?
