 Hey there.  Trying hard to get used to the 11 upgrade.  I can't seem to find the "connect to server" applet.  Any help?
 Cajun_Lan_Man - I would think hard about upgrading.  It's a LOT different
 I'm trying to give it a good chance but I'm not seeing the benefit of the new interfaces
 can anyone tell me where the "connect to server" thing went?
 I know I saw it somewhere and I can't figure out where
 Gnome Classic!?!?  That sounds promising!
 How do I get that?
 ah!
 Beautiful!  Thanks a bunch
 I'll keep giving it a shot but, it's great to know I can do classic if I need to be productive.
 thanks again
 hahahaha
 peace
