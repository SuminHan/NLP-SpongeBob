 I upgraded to Natty, now the computer freezes at startup unless I use a session of type "Ubuntu safe mode". Which log should I look into to diagnose the issue? The freeze occurs both on Unity and on KDE, my default desktop.

 tensorpudding: I'm not sure. I think I tried it and it didn't. I know KDE fails, even after I disabled compiz, so compiz is not the issue. I have direct rendering.
 This is the first time I've used Gnome at all. So far I've been faithful to KDE. So no.
 tensorpudding: I'm just wondering where to look for the cause. There must be a log file with the answer, but I'm not sure where to look.
 tensorpudding: I looked, but found no error.
 tensorpudding: Nothing obvious, at least.
 tensorpudding: could this be it, it looks innocent enough: svc: failed to register lockdv1 RPC service (errno 97)
 tensorpudding: I'll continue investigating. Thanks.
