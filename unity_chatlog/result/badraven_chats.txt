 Hello
 Can someone direct me to info about installing Windows along side ubuntu after unbuntu is installed?
 I was hoping it wasn't going to be like that.
 What about booting from a second hard drive that is set up as the boot drive.  Then I would choose what drive to boot from.
 Thanks Dr willins,  where can I get some info that covers that?
 Ok, thank you.
