 hi
 I updated to natty yesterday
 how can I get the old scrollbars back ?
 bp0 : thank you !
 groundup: look at /var/log/dpkg.log
 groundup: there should be an error at the end of the file
 groundup: do you have any talking about ngnix ?
 groundup: see, there is a lot of "status not-installed nginx-common <none>"
 groundup: seems like you use a ppa, try to contact the ppa maintener
