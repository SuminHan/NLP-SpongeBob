 andeeeuk: I guess if you're having problems with Skype on 11.04, I won't upgrade...
 because we use it too much for me to be without it...
 andeeeuk: i don't understand the second part of what you said
 Hmm... not sure I like Unity. It will sure take some getting used to.
 jatt: haha, that's funny!
 meganerd: you around?
 Anyone here ever set up an Ubuntu box as a wireless access point?
 I know meganerd has, but he's not around - it seems.
 sdollins: good to know. I was thinking of upgrading my Maverick system to Natty. Now I'll wait. :)
