 hi, since 11.04 pidgin doesn't display in the notification area, is there any way to fix this?
 ikonia, thanks, but does that mean there is no way to keep using it, because I do like pidgin :)
 ikonia, well, it is still possible to use it...
 ikonia, the same way I've always used it?
 ikonia, it was still installed after the dist-upgrade?
 ikonia, no, the notification area on the top right in unity, next to the power-button etc, does not show the pidgin icon anymore
 trism, it does show in the messaging menu, but how can I add it to the whitelist?
 logi, yes I can, but i would like to have the pidgin icon back as it was in gnome :)
 trism, thanks, do you need to update it some way or is closing the editor enough to apply the changes?
 trism: thanks, I will do that, i'll get back to you
 flodine, as a matter of fact, had that twice today
 flodine, while using vlc to watch a video, in case that helps
 tried it, unfortunately even after restarting pidgin after setting the whitelist to all i still don't have the pidgin icon in the notification area, while that is set in preferences to show always
 trism, okay, did you use pidgin, Pidgin, or all?
 trism, not sure if it's case sensitive
 trism, thanks, will do a unity restart
 trism, it worked, thanks a lot :D
 hi guys, my unity launcher won't hide anymore, for some reason, is there any way to force it to hide?
 don't know about 2d, i'm running standard natty, but yes, nvidia drivers
 zizban: don't know about 2d, i'm running standard natty, but yes, nvidia drivers
 CryptKper, upgrade
 zizban, so I need to install unity2d then? for the record, this is the second time today this has happened (rebooted last time) - i had no problems till today
 CryptKper, should be fine forever, or for just this time?
 CryptKper, last time a reboot did the trick but now it happened again. Only thing I can think of is I started to use different workspaces today
 anyhow, there is no way to invoke the launcher to hide?
