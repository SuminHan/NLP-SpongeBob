 RavenHursT: What's up?
 hi uwe__
 rafi: sudo nvidia-xconfig solved my display issues.
 RavenHursT: Are you doing a sudo apt-get upgrade with 10.04 in a virtual machine?
 RavenHursT: Hmm...well, it's possible that the VM network emulator is doing something that apt-get doesn't like.
 RavenHursT: Before you do that, try restarting the machine and doing sudo apt-get upgrade again.
 ilea: The installation process should include a partitioning option. Shrink your Windows partition to make room, then install in the free space with the PCLinux live CD.
 ilea: Good to hear. :)
 Guys, don't deny support to people that use Ubuntu derivatives. Linux Mint and PCLinuxOS are just as compatible as Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, etc.
 Pudabudigada: Unfortunately, there is no way to revert other than a backup and clean install. Minor fixes in 11.04 will come regularly, but major changes will have to wait until 11.10 is released in October.
 LjL: The same can be said to someone (like me and many of the other users here) that uses Ubuntu with a custom kernel. Uncertainty to custom installs will always be.
 LjL: This sort of crap is part of what's making me switch to Fedora when my SSD gets here. xD
 rafi: That's a driver issue. Start by typing sudo gedit /etc/default/grub into a terminal, then tell me once you have that open.
 rafi: Good. Now change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="" into GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="acpi_osi=Linux"
 Once that's done, type sudo update-grub into the terminal. A reboot may be necessary.
 rafi: Once that's done, type sudo update-grub into the terminal. A reboot may be necessary.
 rafi: Try adjusting your brightness. If it isn't working now, then yes, reboot.
 RavenHurst: Well, that sucks. Be sure to make a small partition for it if you're doing a hard disc install.
 RavenHursT: Well, I doubt you wanna clear your existing install just to try another OS out. Until you're sure it's what you want to use primarily, give Ubuntu about 20GB to play with.
 RavenHurst: Suit yourself. I hope that one works a little better.
 rafi: Well, I'm not sure what to tell you. Try creating a thread on Ubuntu's hardware forum, and be specific about what hardware you have.
 mister_m: Because Natty may be stable, but it's about as usable as Debian 3. I call it Ubuntu Vista.
 Pudabudigada: Did you upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04?
 Pudabudigada: I never recommend that. I would back up your home folder and do a fresh install of 11.04.
 mister_m: If you upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04, I would back up your home folder and do a clean install. That often fixes issues caused by a distro upgrade.
 Pudabudigada: No, but there are a couple of ways to back up your apt list for an easy redownload.
 Pudabudigada: head over to http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/ and enjoy. :P
 mister_m: It's a Debian concept (remember that Ubuntu is based on Debian). Debian stable upgrades work just fine. It just isn't as effective for Debian's child.
 improveupon: You dist-upgraded to a new OS with a new kernel and package system. This will cause new problems and exasperate your existing ones. Try backing up your /home and doing a clean install.
 improveupon: Well, the problem is that it ISN'T obvious. Otherwise, I'd have a fix for you. :P
 Guest27469: How do you plan on losing this data? I've never suffered data loss on my ext4 systems.
 sss314: Don't do it! If you have to upgrade to Natty right away, at least back up your /home and do a clean install.
 sss314: Don't use the Upgrade function within Ubuntu. That can cause a lot of trouble. A clean install with a Natty ISO is better.
 rafi: I would create a thread in the Ubuntu forums. Be specific with your hardware.
 sss314: Most of your important data is in your /home folder, so back that up first. Any custom icons and themes will be in their own folders in /usr/share/. Other than that, all you'll have to do is personalize the OS and redownload your apts.
 iceroot: I'm glad you've gotten lucky, but most dist-upgrades cause problems.
 LjL: Oh, of course he can try a dist-upgrade once his stuff is backed up.
 iceroot: "of course" because you have the numbers for me? I see dist-upgrade problems ALL THE TIME.
 sss314: Definitely back up your Home first. After that, you're welcome to upgrade in the manner of your choice.
 sipior: On a help channel, on multiple Linux and Ubuntu forums, and on multiple blogs. Don't fill in my sentences for me.
 LjL: That's pretty much what the Software Manager does in GUI, right? I was speaking of both terminal upgrades and GUI upgrades.
 LjL: A repo check makes sense.
 sss314: Oh, definitely do that first. You want to WANT the new version, believe me. xD
 iceroot: I've seen plenty of broken upgrades through the GUI mangers, both Synaptic and Ubuntu's update manager.
 jwmto: You're at the right place. Just let us know what the problem is and we'll do what we can.
 jwmto: Could you be more specific on what kind of iMac you have? Do you know what processor it has?
 sss314: That's a bit of a loaded question. Unity 3D is a bit slower than Gnome, but Unity 2D is usually faster. KDE is still the heaviest desktop, and you still have options like Xubuntu and Lubuntu for a more lightweight desktop.
 sss314: The change in DE (Desktop Environment) means that you'll be swapping out some apps (Gedit, for example is a Gnome text editor, while emacs is for KDE), but the core OS is mostly the same.
 sss314: Of course, most apps work just fine outside of their native DE. My roommate's machine is running XFCE along with a few Gnome apps just fine.
 sss314: I like Xubuntu, but I prefer Gnome on a machine that can handle Gnome. Luckily, there are guides on switching from one DE to another easily, no reinstall required. :)
 Zeeofu: That's a pretty vague question. What are you looking for in particular?
 Zeeofu: Well, this definitely isn't that. xD Try FreeBSD or OpenBSD, and look up derivatives of those.
 Olson_: Normally, I would recommend upgrading to a new kernel or switching to Liquorix, but I haven't been keeping up on Natty kernels...
 Olson_: That sucks. Give Liquorix a shot: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/03/how-to-install-liquorix-kernel-in.html
 Olson_: I've never had to do anything like that, but I don't have your hardware. I can understand why you wouldn't want to repeat such a chore.
 Olson_: typically, Xorg will reconfigure itself independent of your kernel choice. Just give it a shot. If Liquorix gives you trouble, you can always boot back into the generic kernel you had before.
 Olson_: Always worth a shot. Good luck. :)
 jaszandre: I love Gedit! What problems are you having?
 sine_: If you want pause/resume, try a torrent: http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.04/ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent
 jaszandre: Does Gedit work in the alt-F2 prompt?
 bsamson: That is a known Flash issue. Try opening your Flash preferences and disabling hardware acceleration.
 bsamson: Google fullscreen flash linux and you'll have millions of hits.
 ShockDoc: Plenty here. :P
 bsamson: Ancient, but still very relevant. The problem has not been solved on even the newest version of Flash, the newest version of Ubuntu, and the newest Linux kernel.
 hadorhuorn: As I understand it, Unity has not yet been properly optimized for multiple monitors. Gnome might serve you a bit better for that, imo.
 jaszandre: Are you using an up-to-date version of Ubuntu with Gnome?
 hadorhuorn: Unity is very young, and is proprietary to Canonical and Ubuntu. Gnome and KDE, on the other hand, are very established for all desktop purposes. That's just a reality at the moment. =/
 jaszandre: I saw it, but I'm not sure how to solve it. I would try Googling one or two of the error lines.
 ruffleS: I have no reason to think that the swappiness won't still work.
 hadorhuorn: Long live Gnom- Uhh, I mean, no problem. :P
 ruffleS: It often improves system responsiveness, but remember that suspend and hibernate depend on swap by default.
 ChrisBuchholz: You will likely need to build that from a tarball source, since the PPA version is up to 3.1
 ChrisBuchholz: It's highly unusual that you specifically need Python 2.7 for a project. Are you sure you can't roll with Python 3.1?
 enlight22: Frankly, I don't think Unity is ready for use on multiple windows. =/
 andeeeuk_: In the new GIMP 2.8, single window mode is activated via a checkbox in the Windows menu.
 enlight22: Haha, I hear you. Well, are you using an Nvidia or ATI video device?
 andeeeuk_: I no longer use GIMP, but when I did, I used this repo: http://ppa.launchpad.net/matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn/ubuntu maverick main deb
 andeeeuk_: Use this authentication key line: sudo apt-key adv - recv-keys - keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 405A15CB
 andeeeuk_: If that is updated, you should have a single-window option.
 andeeeuk_: Yes, I have Photoshop CS5 running smoothly under Wine.
 envygeeks: Check the comments in the WineHQ AppDB.
 andeeeuk_: For a while, I had a couple of glitches, but my own tweaks and a new kernel have it running silk.
 Distress: I've been hearing audio input problems all day. You're not alone.
 andeeeuk_: If you're willing to pay up for it, CS5 is a great upgrade over CS4. I actually upgraded from good old 7.0 xD
 andeeeuk_: Yes, it's definitely costly. I'm a professional graphic designer, and GIMP just wasn't cutting it for me. However, I do use Inkscape in place of Illustrator. I think GIMP is coming along just fine, too.
 myrmidette: Can you be a bit more specific? What OS are you trying to burn it with?
 myrmidette: Ah, yes, Lucid gave me a hard time with the built-in tool. Unetbootin worked fine, though.
 myrmidette: Try installing Unetbootin and burning the USB with that. Make sure to format the USB with the tool before writing to it.
 myrmidette: Oh, my bad. Use Gparted to format the USB drive to ext4. Be VERY careful when selecting the device to format. If you're careless, you risk wiping one of your system partitions.
 myrmidette: If you have the right media name, and it was ext or fat32 before, then sure.
 myrmidette: a format will delete all nonessential files.
 ChessTeach: Software RAID of any kind is nowhere near as beneficial as a hard array controller.
 ChessTeach: Well, that sucks. Raid is very hardware-dependent, so not everyone gets to enjoy it.
 ChessTeach: It's rare. Raid controllers are hardware, so a BIOS update would mean that it was ON your board, but disabled for some reason.
 ChessTeach: Honestly, I don't think Raid arrays are very useful for personal computers. Secure servers, yes, but not desktops.
 ChessTeach: Sounds like you want a solid-state drive, or SSD. It is full flash memory with no moving parts, and is exponentially faster and more stable than traditional hard drives.
 ChessTeach: I'm buying an OCZ Vertex 2 50GB SSD very soon. It should be able to boot Fedora for me in under 12 seconds.
 ChessTeach: I'll be spending about $100 USD on mine. The price goes up quite a bit by storage capacity.
 ChessTeach: If you want to shop for an SSD, look not just at capacity and price, but also at read and write speeds. The Vertex 2 can read over 275MB/s.
 ChessTeach: Well, all upgrades cost money. For what it's worth, I think it's a very worthwhile upgrade.
 ChessTeach: Google is your friend: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID
 ubottu: Your auto-detection could use some revisions.
 elliot_: Yeah, we are. We're thinking of renaming it Halzenbuntu. :P
 Guys, if you don't want Unity, I wouldn't install Natty 11.04. Wait for 11.10 or Linux Mint 11.
 iceroot: I'm perfectly aware of that. I was responding to people encountering issues replacing Unity in their Natty install.
 xcyclist: That means that your graphics configuration is not complete. What video device are you using?
 alkemann: As I understand it, you'll need to switch to the released version to get all of the future updates.
 I gotta go, guys. Take care, and good luck with all of your Natty issues.
 PatrickC_Pre2: Ubuntu can run comfortably with only about 10GB of space.
 REK: I would try a kernel update. Here's a guide to installing Liquorix kernels: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/03/how-to-install-liquorix-kernel-in.html
 PatrickC_Pre2: With such limited space, I would limit it to one installation.
 PatrickC_Pre2: Luckily, 2.5" hard drives are virtually universal and very affordable.
 newubuntu: That's a motherboard issue. Try updating your motherboard firmware, or even a BIOS update might be needed.
 PatrickC_Pre2: I hear you. I see some great options pop onto Craigslist almost every day.
 ronr_: I think gnome-system-monitor will still work in Gnome 3.
 ronr_: My Gnome 3 install didn't last long on my machine, so I can't check for you.
 ronr_: That or alt-F2.
 newubuntu: Wubi won't mess with your motherboard or BIOS. Check the battery and try a motherboard firmware update.
 sabri_icone: I'd head over to the Linux Foundation. They're the leaders in Linux certification, and will be of more help to you than a distro support chat.
 DaveAG: Evolution historically doesn't get along with certain Exchange functions. I'd try Thunderbird.
 DaveAG: Any chance this will help? http://gitorious.org/lightning-exchange-provider/pages/Home
 ronr_: You have Gnome Shell but not Gnome? I must've missed something.
 OneSquared: Gnome can do that. Right-click and Rename.
 Hello, Yulya.
 OneSquared: Open up the folder in Nautilus and Ctrl-F.
 ronr_: My bad, you said shell and I jumped to Gnome Shell for some reason.
 ronr_: Try these in terminal for your CPU and RAM: "free -m" and "cat /proc/cpuinfo"
 ronr_: Good. Sorry for the confusion.
 ronr_: That reads 492 MB of RAM, meaning you have 512MB installed.
 ronr_: It's a bit under par, yeah. xD
 ronr_: There will be a line around the middle of the print with "cpu cores". As you know, multiple cores will fit on one physical CPU, so you have to be careful what you read.
 ronr_: That's odd. O.o
 ronr_: Given your RAM, it's possible that you're using a CPU or motherboard that's too old to provide information that these commands can read. That's just my theory, though.,
 ronr_: Let's try a more specific terminal command: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l
  ronr_: Well, then you have one CPU. We're getting...somewhere.
 ronr_: Any chance you can Pastebin the output of "less /proc/cpuinfo"?
 ronr_: Well, I don't know why it isn't showing the cores, but I know that CPU to be a quad-core.
 ronr_: Yeah, that's odd, too. Did you build this machine, or are you renting it?
 ronr_: Well, something doesn't seem quite right with the configuration. I guess if it's working we shouldn't mess with your work machine, but still... xP
 ronr_: No problem. :)
 ronr_: Well, let me get this out of the way real quick: I never recommend doing a straight upgrade from one version to another. I always prefer backing up the /home folder and doing a clean install.
 ronr_: If you're slick with the install, you can even isolate the /home folder to its own partition. That's what I'll be doing with my upcoming Fedora install.
 ronr_: It's really not so bad. Your app settings are saved in your /home folder, so the rest should only set you back an hour or two every six months. Software upgrades can cause a lot of problems, though.
 ronr_: Normally, yes. Luckily, AptOnCD is here to help: http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/
 ronr_: There is no slick and easy way to upgrade with no chance of issues. Thankfully, this only has to happen every 6-12 months.
 usr13: I guess I should be more careful with my phrasing: upgrading a distro holds the risk of one or two of many potential problems.
 edbian: Yick. x3
 edbian: Sounds about right. :P
 ronr_, edbian: A common philosophy among Linux users is that the cutting edge is overrated. I personally disagree, but stability is welcoming too.
 usr13: I don't speak solely from my time in IRC. Forums, blogs...all covered with upgrade woes. I understand that the success stories typically go unheard, but I'm just saying that a clean install can sidestep these problems.
 edbian, ronr_: That's the spirit. I'm switching to Fedora soon to enjoy the newest app updates in their unadultered goodness. I had some good times in Ubuntu, though...
 ronr_: A media center won't be too picky, so there's little reason for you to be, too. :P
 edbian: Oddly enough, I meant unadulterated. It's early here.
 usr13: Yep. The fresh-install-versus-upgrade is a fight I see picked every time I'm on here.
 bperu: Sounds like Wubi, but there's nothing that will give you a true-to-form install while operating inside of Windows. Don't be too scared of an Ubuntu Live CD.
 bperu: Well, that's gonna put you in a bind. You could use Wubi, but frankly it's more trouble than its worth.
 I'm out, guys. Enjoy your Natty bugs. :P
