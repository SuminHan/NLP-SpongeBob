 A question: does anyone know how to install emerald in 11.04...
 ?
 Tried the emeraldfix.txt, but it keeps given me errors..
 @schnuffle: that's not the problem.. know how to install...
 but the decoration just doesnt show
 @ohsix; yes, but there are still a lot of nice themes that are build on emerald..
 rather than on gtk
 uhmm... so no solution yet?
 @ohsix: yeah, I know there are a lot that are better, but they just don't look that nice..
 would it be an good choise to be back on ubuntu 10.10? Or some other distro based on ubuntu?
 Because I like gnome2, emerald and custimize a lot with ubuntu... '(
 @avinash, do you have a cable next to you?
 hmm.. do you have dual boot? (Windows - Ubuntu)
 hmm... no other device connected to the router?
 and that works?
 oooh oke :P
 hmm.. tried ifconfig to see you ip settings?
 hm.. maybe dns not working, tried to access the router from your (not working) ubuntu box?
 @avinash try to search for an ip of google, anyone knows it?..
 hm.. so this works?
 than I think dns problem. No response when pinging google.com?
 Sorry, need to go...
 try to search on Google, how to fix dns problem.. must be some forum/faq for that :)
