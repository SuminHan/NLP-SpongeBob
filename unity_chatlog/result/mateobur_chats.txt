 Hello all
 I'm having a lot of problems with the repositories in 11.04
 a lot of indexes aren't found, so a lot of packages are not present
 i.e. Err http://ppa.launchpad.net natty/main amd64 Packages
   404  Not Found
 could someone please share a working sources.list for 11.04 with me using pastebin?
 Hello
