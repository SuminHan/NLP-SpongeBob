 hi
 after upgrading my netbook to 11.04, i'm unable to get video
 switching to tty1-6 still gives me the normal prompt though
 i see no peculiar messages in dmesg
 restarting gdm didn't help
 hi Omega
 pfft
 help me! no video after updating to 11.04
 uhm
 hmmm
 Omega: GMA500
 it's an asus eeepc 1101HA
 Omega: switching to tty1 gets me a console
 restarting gdm didn't help
 tty7 still shows the bootup messages
 but it's ... 'frozen'
 i can't scroll
 Omega: tty7 still shows the bootup messages
 but i can't scroll
 and there's no cursor either
 Update from 10.10
 Omega: nope. I installed the eeepc kernel extension though
 Omega: nothing changed
 "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded."
 Omega: yup. nothing.
 which Xorg log should I look at?
 Omega: "module psb not found"
 Omega: apparantly
 "module ABI major version (8) doesn't match the server's version (10)"
 and then proceeds to unlod psb
 unload*
 Omega: i forgot
 Omega: hold on
 Omega: does uvesafb count?
