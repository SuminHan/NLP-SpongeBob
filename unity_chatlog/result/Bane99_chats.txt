 hey all
 got a question
 never used Ubuntu before... when you log into the computer after installing does it give you the dual boot option?
 i have a separate partition for it
 first time i'll be using linux actually
 aside from my android phone :P
 Windows 7 Pro x64bit
 i set aside a 100GB partition for installing another oS
 i havne't installed it yet
 downloading the file
 well the iso
 essentially i'm a linux noob
 sorry guys =/
 lol
 so after making the disk
 boot from cd?
 or should i just install it from windows
 the problem is, my mobo doesn't like to recognize my USB mouse
 in the boot screens
 i tried to install ubuntu awhile ago
 ok
 install it to the free partition
 then will i get the boot choice when i start the computer?
 sigh 50min left on the.iso download
 what is unity?
 is v11 not recommended over 10?
 oh i'm d/l 11
