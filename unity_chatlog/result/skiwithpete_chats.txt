 hi, I've removed ubuntu from a computer I want to sell, but grub continues to load
 how do I get rid of grub?
 how do I rebuild the mbr - its a netbook so I don't have the windows CD
 PS I don't have the CD, so I want to start using XP which is on the HDD
 I have a pen drive currently it has Mint on it
 is there anything in there that can help me?
 mbrfix?  KM0201
 freedos have it?
 whoa kellnola will that reinstate it as windows?
 KM0201, am going to try your solution first I think
 KM0201, areyou there?
 I've looked at the instructions... one thing concerns me - on the netbook partition 1 is actually a recovery disk
 I want it to boot to partition 2 - XP
 is there a command to do that?
