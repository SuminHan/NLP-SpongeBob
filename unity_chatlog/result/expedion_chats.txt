 Hey
 I am having trouble with unity and cairo atm. For one, if i enable cairo and use its full panel gui, the dock of unity on the left, still remains. 2nd of all my upper dock keeps crashing sometimes when i disable and enable unity again
 Im using ubuntu 11.04
 So how do I make Unity and Compiz/unity work peacefully together when i change theme in cairo
 So that compiz/unity adapt itself to the settings of cairo, and not remain there in its place as a prick :P
 Guys ,any solution?
 can anyone actually read my messages? Im using Xirc chat for the first time
 Ok, thank goodness...
 Cause im having a problem with unity/cairo that id like to have help with
 Ive installed cairo and I changed the theme to japanese dock. Now when I enable this, the unity dock still remains and doesnt go away, so the japanese dock overlaps the unity dock, so im left with 2 different docks (themes) running.
 How can I solve this issue?
 Oh boy, Im just not bein heard at all :(:(
 pfifo, what did u do.
 I hope i do get an answer, because i want to use cairo in its decent form so bad.
 The japanese theme on it just looks so nice.
 Noooo
 Its not a japanese languaged dock, it's a theme called like that in Cairo-Dock.
 incarus6: Am i speaking chinese lol ?:P
 OMG am I speaking chinese lol
 Remove cairo?
 U know, I tried to disable the unity from compiz so I can just run Cairo only in stead, but that leaves the upper and the left side untampered.
 Sort of like a unaltered, unused space.
 that the unity docks used up, is just not used by cairo.
 What's better though, KDE or Gnome?
 Any difference between KDE and Gnome, incarus.

 Heavy weighted? As in it takes alot of memory?
