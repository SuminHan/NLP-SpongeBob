 finally I got my wireless usb adapter working in 10.10!
 jack123: Ubuntu
 jack123: try fedora
 jack123: mandriva,debian,fedora all are decent
 jack123: mandriva is probably the most noob friendly other than ubuntu
 Jack123: download 'virtual box' and check them all out
 Jack123: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
 can't believe that program is free
 hi geekorama
 Ravenhurst: what program did you use to make the USB?
 jack123: you can check both of them out in VB
 RavenhursT: watch for any errors when you pendrivelinux....might have a broken image,have to redownload it
 give a go
 which version of ubuntu jack123?
 cool
 jack123: you got a decent video card?
 me neither
 jack123: the grub menu ?
 jack123: where did you download the ISO and what distro?
 jack123: alternate?
 whats the filename of your ISO image
 jack123: you got a 64-bit cpu ?
 jack123: remake the usb with pendrive linux
 wimax?
 what is that?
 jack123: are you using wimax right now in windows?
 jack123: do you know to log-into the wimax box ? access the shell ?
 *how to log-in
 in ubuntu does it connect to it?
 yeah
 you know on the panel on the top,can you connect to the wimax signal
 does it even show wireless connections?
 *wireless networks i mean
 the icon that looks like a signal
 does it list a wireless network when you click that icon?
 you have a ethernet cable going to your comp?
 oh
 you have DHCP turned on?
 on the wimax box ?
 he doesnt have wireless
 he has a 4g wimax box
 but the box is receiving a wireless signal ?
 and sending that to your comp over ethernet?
 go into 192.168.1.1 and hit the print screen button
 and show me
 no wait
 do this
 boot into the live cd and 'try ubuntu'
 on the top panel click system > administration > network tools
 theres a pull-down menu on 'network devices '
 select (eth0) and see if it has been assigned an IP. It (eth0) should be on the list too.
 try this first
 k
 yup
 jack123: the ip should not be 0.0.0.0 either
 it should be 192.168.1.xxx
 jack123: also do 'lspci' and see if your NIC is on there
 if its on there then it's loaded right? working properly? correct driver? Herbs?
 it will be listed by 'ethernet controller'
 yeah
 he did that already and said internet wasn't working though right ? jack123?
 jack123: Have you booted into the live cd and done 'try ubuntu' ?
 why was he saying his internet wasn't working????
 and why would a live cd ask him to select a kernel image? he has left out some info
 grub does that after installation
 ahoy
 me neither
 i don't know what he was talking about.....
 he also mentioned something about the 'alternate' iso image way back too
 isn't that a text-based installation ?
 i'm not familiar with the alternate iso
 oh lol
 nah i never used it
 he probably doesn't even know what md5 is
 the version of syslinux he was seeing was not what his iso image should have contained either
 so......who knows
 im here
 so what happened
 what took so long ?
 ;-)
 are you doing a dual-boot? or giving ubuntu  the whole hdd
 reinstall

 oops
 i have no idea, try a reinstall
 you trying to make a live usb stick ?
 download unetbootin then clerisy
 yes please jack,want to see this
 i don't think so, Herbs ?
 jack do you have another usb stick? your going to need to save the screen capture some how to upload it
 open the terminal jack
 applications > accesories > terminal
 type uname -a
 do the same command once you install
 jack123: when you installed and got to partitioning what did you select? 'use entire disk' ?
 jack123: you need to check the md5 of the iso image
 and see if they match
 on another computer?
 or another disk in same computer case?
 jack123: ?
 do you have two hard-drives in the computer jack?
 are you seeing it in ubuntu ?
 the usb stick is read-only
 when in live mode
 my connection is too slow right now too do that
 jack123: does windows have the entire disk ? the other disk that it is on
 wait
 windows have entire disk ?
 it has all 500gb?
 ok reboot into windows and download md5sum and get the md5 of the ubuntu iso
 write it down
 and come back
 google md5sum program
 i have temperature and weather checked but it's not showing up on the panel ?
 Herbs, when i tried Fedora it did a LVG for partitioning,what is that?
 it took up the entire hd but said there was free space ?
 it is like extended parts inside a logical part?
 oh
 i'm thinking the md5 is off
 and your going to have to re-download the iso
 wait, let marenostrum see what the md5 is
 if they match
 there is a file
 jack123:  checking now
 jack123: they match
 what program did you use to make the usb ?
 remake the usb with unetbootin jack
 remake the usb
 use unetbootin
 make sure you format the usb
 as fat32
 oh,lol
 can you burn discs jack ?
 burn the iso to a cd
 frees up the usb too
 yeah burn it and install it
 burn as a data disc
 ok
 i've had problems with usb installations
 k
 good
 yeah follow the page he pointed you to jack on burning iso
 k
