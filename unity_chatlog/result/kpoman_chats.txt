 hey all
 11.04 is buggy for you too guys ? for me it wont restart/stop. and ATI radeon stopped working
 KNUBBIG: when I try to restart / stop, it just logs out and hangs
 KNUBBIG: even magic sysrq keys fail
 what I dont understand is why, if I had the same kernel **before** the upgrade, my ATI stopped working (DRI disabled)
 if someone know how to troubleshot / solve this ? X is unusable in vesa mode (1680x1050)
 why with same kernel between 10.10 and 11.04 does ATI fail now to load DRM ?
 if someone know anything here ?
 why with same kernel between 10.10 and 11.04 does ATI fail now to load DRM ? Help !
 rgr: I slightly changed the sentece
 ok... I am now in ubuntu ! do someone know what could be wrong with radeon and X ? Why is it now failing to load with DRI ?
 I do have errors on Xorg.0.log like "[    34.288] (EE) RADEON(0): [dri] RADEONDRIGetVersion failed because of a version mismatch." and some segfaults on fglrx tools
 guys please I pasted here my Xorg.0.log debug information. I dont understand why my "supported card" isnt working after upgrade to 11.04: http://pastebin.com/nKRxwuuU

 hey guys ! I think I solved my issue (fglrx incompatibility) ... how do I enable desktop effects on 11.04 ? they seem disabled
 is there somewhere to enable desktop effects ?
 bitplane: did that, saw my 4 desktops
 bitplane: see here: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/desktopeffects ... they talk about a visual effects option in appearance. I dont have that option !!!
 izinucs: I think I dont use unity ... dont know why. I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 and dont see any desktop difference apart from no effects
 izinucs: is there something to do to get unity ?
 oops started unity as root and that stuffed it all
