 Good night guys. Maybe someone could help me? I might have rebooted my system before the upgrade to 11.04 was over (the login screen was showing "reboot needed" or something to that effect). Now the box won't boot, and the kernel/dist is not showing on GRUB screen. Can I salvage it with a 10.10 live (USB)?
 When I reboot, the GRUB shows, but I only have 10.10's listed
 Rehan: No. The GRUB screen shows, I select the last kernel (still 10.10) and the boot stops, complaining of a disk not mounted....
 Kevin147: Sorry, no. The actual boot screen (to select the kernel version)
 Kevin147: Sorry for the poor explaining. :-)
 Kevin147: Do you know if I CHROOT to the partition and do a dist-upgrade would work?
 Kevin147: Well, I think the worse it could do is finish destroying the install... Not too different of the current situation... :-)
 Kevin147: I'll keep you posted... ;-)
 Kevin147: Just an update... Tried the apt-get dist-upgrade, the machine complained and asked for a "dpkg --configure -a". It's still running, I think it's finishing the upgrade... Still hopeful... ;-)
 Kevin147: I hope so!! lol
 Kevin147: Thanks a bunch, man! ;)
 Kevin147: It was a LOT of work and wait, but it worked. Natty Narwhal is running... ;) Thanks again!
