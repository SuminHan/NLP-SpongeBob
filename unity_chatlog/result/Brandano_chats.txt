 Good evening, I need a little help with the MOTD on an Ubuntu Server 10.04 machine
 for some reason I get two sets of landscape-info output, the second being an old stale copy
 meraqlix: first thing to check is for (EE) lines in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 meraqlix:  Ah, so you are only missing the UI? then xorg will be fine
 meraqlix: anyway, CTRL+ALT+F1 will give you a terminal window, CTRL+ALT+F7 will return you to the graphical environment
 meraqlix: you ought to be able to install gnome that way, and then select it from the login screen
 coz_: for what exactly?
 coz_: ah, I don't use compiz. Or Unity, for that matter. Still running 10.10 on my client and 10.04 on a server
 coz_: I am waiting for a bit while all the users tell Canonical why they don't like Unity and someone forks to Gubuntu :)
 Snakkah: you should look into either adding a PPA or enabling the backports repository
 coun: I don't use compiz because it's too fancy... I doubt I'd like Unity. On my netbook I switched back to UNR because it was making my life too difficult
 Snakkah: try grabbing the deb from Maverik, but expect possible problems. Try it in a chroot first, perhaps?
 terminal window, if you like
 kwtm: depends. You are not supposed to spend time tweaking the OS, should just work
 kwtm: nah, in my case is to install and compile stuff, mainly
 kwtm: I got used to PuTTY for SSH on Window. I really ought to use the SSH client from the command line, but it's hard to shake ingrained habits
 kwtm: no, neither is, but Ubuntu is not the frieldliest environment to work with non-standard libs
 *friendliest
 kwtm: not much difference. Putty allows you to store session parameters, and shows a black terminal background
 Snakkah: in a chroot?
 So, any idea why the landscape data in MOTD is written twice, witht he second set being a stale copy?
 Snakkah: no, you don't. It was just a safety in case it tried to replace stuff it ought not to
 kwtm: no, I mean that putty is a graphical app. but you know it since you used it. You can install it in Ubuntu as well. Does not have any great advantages over the standard SSH client, except the user interface simplifies a few things
 kwtm: like storing the configuration for often used connections. You can of course just write a small shell script for that sort of stuff
 well, I use it :)
 downside, it uses its own format for keys
 but on the plus side on Ubuntu it makes use of the OS keyring
 kwtm: just tunnel the SSH port, I imagine
 kwtm: same as that double SSH conn you use. Uses up a little more processor, perhaps
 hmm, i use VNC tunneled over SSH, but only for Windows machines. And even then probably I ought to use therminal server
 Hmm, I think I ought to check back once the 11.04, err, backlash has died down a bit. It's a minor annoyance anyway
 Jordan_U: I bet they will just update it to the point you won't be able to tell it apart from Gnome 2
 billsmith: just use an actual terminal rather than the terminal window. CTRL+ALT+F1 to CTRL+ALT+F& . CTRL+ALT+F7 will bring you back to the graphical interface
 err, s/F&/F6/
 that would be a release from November 2004?
 MnCC: runs on wine
 AMAG: check the output from glxinfo and /var/log/Xorg.0.log for (EE) lines ( cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep \(EE\) )
 MnCC: nope. I have plenty of other stuff running with Wine on ext3 though
 MnCC: Steam, Myst Online... games mainly
 MnCC: to be honest, Steam is installed on ext3, but the appdata folder is a symlink to a folder on an NTFS partition
 MnCC: that way I get to reuse the same space for Windows and Linux. I rarely run Windows, but some of the steam apps won't run on Linux
 AMAG: does  glxinfo say "direct rendering: on" somewhere?
 MnCC: I doubt I have enough processor power for serious 3D graphics in a virtual PC
 AMAG: sorry, I meant "Yes" instead of "on"
 AMAG: then your drivers are installed fine
 AMAG: the problem is somewhere else
 AMAG: did you restart the desktop manager after installing them?
 AMAG: neither does mine, doesn't seem to be a problem. In the "device" section what is the value of "Driver" ?
 AMAG: that really ought to be enough
 AMAG: anyway, messed up stuff in xorg.conf would show in the logs
 Well, if you started the safe graphics mode it won't be used in your current session, but I guess that is not what you mean
 Do you have the Nvidia X Server Settings icon in System>Administration?
 Perhaps it is mapped to a different display
 edbian: I bet for autohide
 Ah, missing decorators in compiz
 Master: I can give you some generic solutions, or do you want a specific one?
 Master: why would you ask that in an ubuntu centric channel?
 edbian: I had that problem in the past when fiddling with an early compiz and emerald
 edbian: but I don't remember how I got around fixing it. Ultimately I fixed everything by disabling Compiz
 tbrew13: let me google a bit
