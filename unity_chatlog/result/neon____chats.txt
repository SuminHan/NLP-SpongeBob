 WOW!! what the hell they were thinking when they developed the latest ubuntu
 i feel like an 85 year old granma that needs big buttons for everything when using the latest ubuntu
 unity is a joke
 what moron came up with that interface
 we suppose to move forward and this latest update seems to take us back to the 80's
 unity is a joke
 i'm just venting, cause we can do better
 how we suppose to reach the masses when we released stuff like this
