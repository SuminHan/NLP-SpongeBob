 no i dual boot and just ubuntu is screwed
 after boot it shows blinking icons and doesnt let me do anythinh
 it worked before the update
 perfectly
 my question is where to find out how to fix it without downloading a disk and reinstlling
 no all i see is my desktop backround and blinking icons
 if by cold boot u mean manually resetting the computer and selecting the kernel i do that
 thanks i will try that
