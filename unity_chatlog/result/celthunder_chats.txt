 probably wouldn't work as that's not even java but :/ i just run mine from the cli
 cc11rocks: java -jar <file>
 or javacc i think works
 it is
 cc11rocks: add a shebang to it? idk if that'd work or not
 just an idea
 cc11rocks: #!/usr/bin/java -jar  at the top of the file
 probably wouldn't work as that's not even java but :/ i just run mine from the cli
 cdoktor19: amd64
 though you can run either...no reason not to run 64 if you can
 Spaz_Dynamic: setup the partitions and don't format /home?
 cdoktor19: yeah it's fin
 temporarytao: flash works fine...just make a 32 bit chroot or use multilib
 cdoktor19:  multilib is probably easier then unless you want to seperate 32 bit apps from 64 and since you don't seem to care...
 renancoelho: any errors? is gdm running?
 Herbs: init 5 is i thought X session init 3 is terminal
 init 1 single user and 2/6 reboot/shutdown (i think)
 Herbs: yeah sounds right
 renancoelho: no
 gueriLLaPunK: whatever you want? just make sure he has a shell and preferably a home dir so he doesn't get thrown in /
 BC_: install the 32 bit libs?
 cordoval_: stop repeating...if someone knows they'll answer
 snow_us: visudo
 snow_us: hmm...remove it from group wheel/sudo?
 snow_us: you use su
 snow_us: if you don't set a root pw or forget to just login to single user mode and set one
 snow_us: su is a command to switch user
 Zavior: what's the error
 herc_: within the next 23 hours
 guest345345: hopefully 0
 newbie28: what's your wifi chipset
 newbie28: ok
 newbie28: ath9k module should work fine
 newbie28: ? so type in the right one
 newbie28: did you pick the right network security type
 newbie28: do you have wpa_supplicant installed (you should but...never hurts to double check)
 jasonmchristos: zip files are easily cracked ..not a good method of security
 fedora fails...
 ChronicSyncope: go for arch it totally rapese debian
 S-M-Gl: what's the error
 S-M-Gl: whats the error?
 Tully_: Dta
 Medfordite: that driver should work already
 Medfordite: b43 i've seen used before
 Medfordite: so? find the broadcom modules and install them and load them if they don't work use ndiswrapper
 Medfordite: regardless b43 support works one way or another
 rgoytacaz: blame nvidia...or use the open source drivers...which work quite well
 rgoytacaz: cause you're insane?
 Souperman: that's just plain wrong
 rgoytacaz: nah lol just saying...using the oss drivers works for 99/100 things...try them out first
 laumonier: transmission-gtk
 Souperman: i'm on arch...which is rolling release...which just proves the above statement abundantly false ...as does gentoo, slackware, lfs, etc
 Souperman: all of them allow you to pretty much update anything whenever you want as long a you upgrade everything else with it
 NotTooDumb3: it's a plugin
 Captainkrtek: what's your printer doing
 ikevin_: crossover cable
 ikevin_: or straight through depending what the nics are
 Belinrahs: chipset?
 ikevin_: ok i'll read that ina moment
 ikevin_: switch justno router?
 ikevin_: :/ not sure then
 ikevin_: fibre ends are annoying...or maybe that's just cause i do them with bad equipment
 ikevin_: i meant like physically doing them
 not routing them /etc
 ikevin_: hook me up with some hw :)
 rgoytacaz: hold alt i think
 rgoytacaz: or ctrl
 ikevin_: yeh put them in different vlans and use the pc as the router to itself...
 ikevin_: what's your switch?
 ikevin_: :/ ouch...is it that different from other switches/routers?
 ikevin_: from the variety of cisco routers/switches/etc i used 9/10 times the commands are the same despite model
 ikevin_: ah
 ikevin_: well nice job...i'm envious....if you're hiring...let me know :)
 ikevin_: mix of both
 ikevin_: more software
 ikevin_: move this to pm?
 tanath: what packages is buggy
 tanath: ok i just got here let me scroll up
 tanath: ok is it a physical mouse or a touchpad
 tanath: do you have an Xorg configuratioj
 tanath: ok can you check /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ see if you have a config there thats limiting your scrolling
 tanath: that's where synaptics allows you to limit that stuff anyway
 tanath: yeah but doesn't hurt to check if they used the same config location (and other stuff goes in that dir too)
 tanath: ok do you have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 tanath: ok can you pastebin your xorg.conf then
 Cairo|Mac: unless you're WM is on the samba drive it has nothing to do with samba that you're getting dropped to terminal
 tanath: ok np
 Cairo|Mac: then swifch to a terminal and fix you video drivers
 alt f1 / f2
 Geet: thats preference i prefer arch to anything else but others will give you different answers
 Cairo|Mac: alt f1 f2 f3 etc
 tanath: add an entry for your mouse
 tanath: it's probablty not a bug...just add an entry in your xorg.conf for your mouse
 krakpot: is gdm loaded?
 krakpot: or some other startup manager switch to a terminal and telinit 3 then startx
 tanath: ok
 tanath: then it could be evdev the kernel or any number of things
 mikinanuq: yes you can
 mikinanuq: randr
 mikinanuq: try xrandr to load your hdmi after booting
 krakpot: go to a terminal telinit 3 then type startx
 krakpot: what happens?
 Julie972: those aren't commands you run in grub
 Julie972: so they should fail
 krakpot: so install it
 antiphysicist: duh...it's supposed to do that
 antiphysicist: if you want to use your terminal more than one app at a time add an anmperstnd after the command
 krakpot: so install a login manager like gdm kdm slim whatever
 krakpot: lol ....you need one if you want to satrt x automatically
 krakpot: so add a 3 in grub to boot to terminal mode
 krakpot: then you'll boot to init 3
 LAcan: you can install gnome if you want
 LAcan: and to answer your question on swap ...depends on your ram usage and how much you have..if you have 20gb and you on average use one...don't make a swap dir
 krakpot: that work?
 krakpot: http://nixcraft.com/linux-software/2654-ubuntu-set-default-runlevel-etc-inittab.html
 ZykoticK9: theres no such thing as 100 percent stable software
 krakpot: ? any luck
 Shaggy2: xrandr -output <OUTPUTTORESIZE> -mode 800x600
 krakpot: then edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg and add a 3 to the kernel line
 krakpot: save and next reboot should work
 Shaggy2: so use that and change 800x600 to whatever
 Shaggy2: ok uhm what ui you using
 Shaggy2: that sounds more like a window manager restriction than anything
 Shaggy2: change the outputhere part to the one you want
 Shaggy2: for example i'm on a netbook so i use xrandr -output LVDS1 -mode 1024x600 -output VGA1 -mode 1440x900
 Shaggy2: also helps to spcefiy where to put them such ass ad -right-of LVDS1 after output vga1 asw ell
 Shaggy2: sure type xrandr by itslef to find what the current outputs/settings for each are
 Shaggy2: should be able to find the errant one
 Barsuk: install unity/gnome whichever you want
 Cairo: i helped you ? when
 karthick87: that's a security feature.
 pamela: .bashrc or .profile or in inittab
 pamela: depending on the command and who you want to run it as and at what init level
 Pascalcmoi: so start submitting bug reports
 Pascalcmoi: i don't even look at my ubuntu comp...it's a server and i havn't touched it other than to fix a thing or two ...i use arch day to day
 pamela: probably in your gui's startup scripts then
 pamela: add it to your .xinitrc
 pamela: open a terminal nano ~/.xinitrc find the uncommented line (the one not starting with a #) and add your conky line before that one
 B_K_N: ntp
 well assuming you want the right time ntp and set your timezone in sysconfig/tzdata
 pamela: try adding it to .bashrc or .profile then
 HomuHomuHomura: depends what's broken
 Inphernal: so what packages are being held
 jetole: ok
 thanks MK```
 Inphernal: jetole did you md5 your packages, any of them just crashing out? what happens if you install a few at a time
 HomuHomuHomura: uhm what're you recovering from
 if you're recovering something i'm assuming something is broken
 HomuHomuHomura: then yeah
 jetole: ok sorry for highlighting you then
 JoseeAntonioR: rmmod <whatever nvidia driver is loaded< modprobe i915 or whatever intel driver applies
 jetole: eh it'd fix it for the current session at least
 JoseeAntonioR: blacklist the module you don't want
 and it won't load it
 jetole: fine by me lol i'm just listing off solutionsas thhey occur...i set every module i want loaded on boot and blacklisted the rest
 sly: try alsamixer
 Inphernal: no not really sorry
 Pascalcmoi: what's your issue sorry wasn't reading
 sly: ok what gui are you using?
 sly: and what's your default audio controller alsa or pulse?
 and either way i'm fairly sure your multimedia keys shouldn't be affected by which...
 Pascalcmoi: oh that's easy
 add a .desktop file
 for ratpoison
 abhinav_: partition resize
 sly: is something else locking up audio device? (fuser /dev/snd
 Pascalcmoi: no you have to make one one sec
 Pascalcmoi: ok so do this vi /usr/share/xsessions/ratpoison.desktop
 Pascalcmoi: and then add this text to it http://pastebin.com/Scs4N6Zy
 Pascalcmoi: replace the executable line
 meganerd: it's in /etc/issue /etc/motd and /etc/banner or whatever files are mentioned in your sshd config
 sly: ok
 Pascalcmoi: so change it to xfce ...
 meganerd: yeah...it's a script in /etc/ that sshd calls
 Pascalcmoi: add the file i just told you to..if it doesn't exist...
 Pascalcmoi: idk
 and meganerd i edited it out on my server...i forgot where...it was in /etc though
 Pascalcmoi: i just listed a possible solution if it doesn't work...oh well...if it does...yay
 newb_: ps x |grep gnome-shell
 jetole: he said he was using i915
 Pascalcmoi: ok so it worked?
 kk
 Pascalcmoi: idk unbind it in unity...i use xmonad...so i don't have that issue
 ohsix: i810 can work for 3d...kms is broken though
 ohsix: jetole JoseeAntonioR disable kms?
 ohsix: ok i stopped using that comp a while ago...was just a remembering
 illmortal: what's your login issue
 illmortal: ctrl alt f1 login and dmesg tail /var/log/syslog.log
 (dmesg and the tail part are two different)
 eh just want to know what it's stopping on
 no
 well if it reboots instead of throwing you in a terminal yes
 monekfygh: not a gnome thing but acpi / apmtool
 iam126: http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http://godmode.cc/
 Pascalcmoi: replace what?
 iam126:idk probably ping/traceroute
 nslookup then ping then traceroute
 would be the order i would test in
 maybe switch traceroute and ping
 np
 iam126: ok what's the issue ?
 iptables running on the server?
 bad routing at a router?
 ARP/RARP working properly?
 illmortal: boot to init 3 does that work?
 illmortal: from there run startx and see if that fials
 iam126: if you're using cisco hw for the routers i can probably help a bit
 illmortal: edit grub when booting to boot to init 3
 illmortal: you could also use init 1 but..either way from there login as your user and type startx
 iam126: i need a new job so lol :) feel free i'd gladly throw in a few hours free for something worth it in the end
 tyr: whats your card chipset and issue with it also any network managers used /modules/etc
 iam126: move to pm?
 illmortal: in grub push e and then go to kernel line and edit it to add a 1 or a 3 at the very end (with a space after last line made) then ctrl x to boot it
 tyr: read up and answer above questions
 karthick87: 64 bit or 32 bit
 karthick87: then it should be as easy as adding whatever repo flashplugin is in to your sources.list and apt-get update apt-get install flashplugin
 brandonc503_: install an ftpd
 Bsims: pulseaudio oss or alsa?
 tamara__: i could read that line
 bsims ok try load-sample-lazy x11-bell /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/dialog-error.oga
 load-module module-x11-bell sample=x11-bell
 Bsims: ah that does exactly the opposite to it lol
 newb_: do they show up as hardware, pulseuadio oss or alsa and what're you using to test did you check if muted
 Bsims: can it find it? whats the error from modprobe
 spicytaco: #chatzilla ?
 dreamsforgotten: is it in your path?
 permissions?
 dreamsforgotten: permissions?
 spicytaco: what're you trying todo with chatzilla i hate it as it's a terible client but ...
 luthfi: hi
 dreamsforgotten: set it +x lol
 since most of the stuff in there you're executing
 kazuhiko: ?
 what about installing it
 spicytaco: weechat/irssi or xchat
 dreamsforgotten: chmod
 newb_: is pulseuadio taking over it?
 newb_: i'd bet if the mixer looks wierd and wierd sounds come from alsa that pulse took over the device (or that's what happens for me if i use alsa for something s while pulse is using the hardware
 kazuhiko: ok where did you get stuck?
 spicytaco: silverex.org -- free version for windows
 spicytaco: not much lol it's literally the same
 dreamsforgotten: chmod 777 adb then do ./adb
 dreamsforgotten: if it still doesn't find it something is majorly wrong (like your 32 bit lib's
 dreamsforgotten: add it to your path and chmod the entire directory like this chmod -R 777 ./
 and then you can skip the ./ whenever (as long as its in your path
 newb_: yeah you can make it work do tthis ps auxf |grep pulseaudio any results oether than your grep command?
 Guest55198: /nick changes your nick
 dreamsforgotten: lol i'm useless...just helping a few that i can
 wolfric: do we care?
 kazuhiko: what drive did you install grub to and whats the error and what version of grub/etc
 harushimo: that's up to you but you need the SDK either way
 _genuser_: launcher for what?
 newb_: kill them all
 kazuhiko: did you install 64 bit version on a 32 bit machine
 kazuhiko: is the processor 32 only?
 faateh: ? depends on your hardware/what you use
 _genuser_: launcher for what? X? your WM? your question is a bit generic
 Ziber: laptop-mode-tools
 also acpi/apm
 Ziber: i'm not on ubuntu so idk the relevant package names but acpi is pretty common service for monitoring stuff like temp/battery and laptop-mode-tools conrols fans/etc
 DrMax: boot to a cd and chroot to your system
 DrMax: then build your kernel and should be fine
 DrMax: uhm boot to usb/cd ...go to a terminal instead of using the setup then type mkdir /tmp/a /tmp/b then do mount /dev/<yourhddwith/boot> /tmp/a  then mount /dev/<yourhddpartitionwith /> /tmp/b
 DrMax: then chroot /tmp/b
 er shit sorry drmax change /tmp/a to /tmp/b/a
 in all above references
 then chroot to it
 dreamsforgotten: ok did you check for held packages ? someone i weas helping the other day i remember the solution for if not
 DrMax: from the chroot finish ompiling your kernel
 DrMax: chroot /tmp/a
 dreamsforgotten: ?
 DrMax: now either reinstlal the kernal package or go to kernel.org in links/lynx /using wget and dl a kernel source and start compiling
 DrMax: to reinstall the package dpkg -i /var/apt-cache/whateveryour kernelpackage is
 dreamsforgotten: no held packages?
 redgone: backtrack is cool...kind of shitty for a daily distro though
 good for what it's made for though
 DrMax: ?
 crlcan81: gts 250's shouldn't lag just loading the ui...
 dreamsforgotten: idk i didn't read the first link
 CoinOp: what else does it say
 DrMax: what didn't?
 DrMax: did you make your initramfs?
 DrMax: ok
 and in /etc/fstab your line for proc is waht
 DrMax: mkinitcpio
 DrMax: ? that?
 tamara__: what's the issue with them?
 DrMax: mount proc /prpc
 er
 DrMax: mount proc /proc sorr
 drAg: i need help
 DrMax: -t procfs
 drAg: i need help
 drAg: do you provide psychological help for the demented
 DrMax: you compiled your kernel wrong then
 DrMax: put yes for procfs support
 drAg: you don't necessarily need a rescue cd to fix boot issues
 DrMax: how did you reinstall the kernel
 DrMax: mount /proc and /dev in your chroot then redo the kernel
 DrMax: sorry i probably should have said that
 drAg: help me..stop spamming the freaking channel
 Ato/b 22
 Sharpshooter761: hello
 DrMax: you need to mount /proc...
 not unmount it
 DrMax: mount it before joining the chroot hang on
 DrMax: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1156240.html read that
 lol
 DrMax: sorry...i shoulda specified you'd need those the first time
 DrMax: more like i just didn't think about mentioningi t
 furous: what's your issue sorry wasn't paing attention
 _genuser_: what version did you start out on when upgrading
 aauthor: is there a conflicting entry in .xinitrc or in xsessions
 aauthor: furous conflicting entry in xsessions/xinitrc/etc
 furous: aauthor also login manager being used?
 DrMax: sarcastic or happy?

 furous: then type startx
 what's the result
 !kick drAg
 Rockj: hi
 DrMax: np
 Sharpshooter761: that's because you complained about it :)
 Sharpshooter761: so it had to work
 furous: and result?
 furous: so make one
 Sharpshooter761: you can make as many clipboards as you want..theres 2 by default though
 Dice-Man: install build-essential and go to rythmbox's site get the source extract and compile or use git/svn
 furous: it's a file so touch .xauthority
 furous: telinit 5
 furous: note telinit 5 won't work if startx didn't
 or it shouldn't
 Sharpshooter761: i have apple pie and caramels?
 taglass: lol true enough telinit 5 without starting x kind of is telinit 3 though (unless he added something to his int
 eigba_: telinit just switches between runlevels
 eigba_: though yeah i worded that badly

 Eric__: so install intel-firmware or i2600 or whatever its called i think it's something i2600-fm?
 Eric__: lshw

 d4gg3r: nmcli
 furous: how about write permissions on other files?
 glaceman: somewhere on somenetwork yes
 d4gg3r: so install the libraries networkmanager relies on
 d4gg3r: ? why should it?
 Viking667: what's the bug?
 furous: ok
 d4gg3r: blame the package manager and just becauase YOU need those libraries doesn't mean everyone else wants them
 furous: no
 Viking667: yeah sounds like a bug to me
 d4gg3r: i didn't say that
 binox: why are you editting xorg to blacklist/unblacklist modules?

 b 21
 madradavid: you're here...whats the problem
 Anax192: whats the prolem
 problem
 Anax192: boot to init 1 (add a 1 to the end of the kernel line in grub)
 rafi_: that's a problem?
 Kingsy101: network is  your subnet gateway is your way out of the network (usually your router)
 Kingsy101: you at home on a home network with stock settings it's likely 255.255.255.0

 biz is key the right arguement for that?
 chaospsychex: what graphics drivers/gui are you using
 chaospsychex: lsmod |grep i915
 area51pilot: startx
 area51pilot: or telinit 5
 area51pilot: do you have X insatlle?
 chaospsychex: searches loaded module for i915
 ikonia: ok good to know
 area51pilot: what did it fail with?
 chaospsychex: that's the most common intel driver (including the one I use)
 area51pilot: ok
 chaospsychex: lsmod
 area51pilot: what graphics card are you using that fglrx is fubared
 chaospsychex: rmmod <current driver>;modprobe <new one>
 area51pilot: are you uing proprietary drivers for your card?
 area51pilot: switch to th open source ones then try
 chaospsychex: what gui are you using and what's currently loaded?
 chaospsychex: go into fallback mode does that work?
 chaospsychex: perhaps your card can't handle gnome 3
 chaospsychex: i mean gnome3 in fallback mode
 chaospsychex: no
 chaospsychex: delete gnome-shell or if you can accss the menu's of the garbled ui go to gnome-control-center. Open System Info > Graphics. Change Forced Fallback Mode to ON.
 Vhozard: xrandr
 Vhozard: ouch?
 ios32: autofs i think has a way to do that
 FalsAlarm: build-essential
 bison: what part of xorg
 bison: can you get to a terminal?
 bison: alt f1 /ctrl alt f1 when it starts going nuts
 can someone kick him?
 bison: ok what gui were you trying to load?
 unityproblem: what's the dpkg error
 html_inprogress: he needs help being kicked
 bison ok can you try loading in fallback mode?
 bison: can your video card handle it
 unityproblem: what's the dpkg error
 Bison using propriertary drivers or open source?
 bison back sorry
 went afk for a minute to answer a call
 let me scrol up
 bison: try the open source ones
 bison: unless you set a specific driver in xorg.conf install them and then use modprobe
 bison: still having issues?
 bison: did the open source drivers help?
 bison: ? i thought you could get to a terminal?
 bison: i'd start with lsmod find your video drivers and modprobe -r them
 bison: i'd then apt-cache search nvidia and find the open source ones and install them
 yeah...so login?
 bison: ? login as your user and sudo su -
 bison: if you don't know your own usernames password then you deserve to get screwed over
 bison: ??????? what does that have todo with anything set a .bash_profile if you want it has nothing to do with your X issue
 uberfrau: you on 64 bit or 32?
 bison: find your video modules and modprobe -r them
 uberfrau: make a 32 bit chroot if 64 bit flash fails (which it does) and install it in that
 uberfrau: then you get your 64 bit system with the 32 bit flash
 bp0: and flash-aid is better than finding the one that works yourself how?
 bp0: j/w....i generally view stuff like that....badly
 bison: modprobe -r <module>
 jgould: can just compile it there, or chroot to it
 alphamale: dd -o <iso> <usb> that'll put the iso on your usb drive so you can install from it
 chrisbster: do they show up in fdisk?
 faryshta: not very...
 chrisbster: so use that to partition instead of the crap default partitioner?
 chrisbster: then mount your drives and skip that step
 bison: ? how's that goign to help
 jgould: you can set --prefix to somewhere other than root would probably be better
 bison: yeah those are your loaded kernel modules
 chrisbster: he's got X issues i told him to use the open source drivers
 chrisbster: and he can't apparently find the nvidia proprietary drivers to get rid of first...meh if he reinstalls hes just gonna end up in the same place
 chrisbster: lsmod lol
 chrisbster: where else would you look
 chrisbster: lsmod modprobe -r them and modprobe up the right ones
 chrisbster: unless you have a better way
 tripelb: vobcopy poweriso or cdrkit
 bison: pastebin the list
 chrisbster: it also saves from having to reinstall the proprietary ones if they aren't the issue
 bison: wgetpaste or curlpaste (you may have to install them with apt-get install)
 chrisbster: i don't want him to uninstall them though just unload them
 faryshta: it's like 530 am and i'm on like no sleep again...give me a break
 :)
 bison: ?  sudo su - type in your user passwrod then type passwd set a root password and then type apt-get install one of the two packages
 van7hu: chrisbster you can increase hibernate speed...depending on other factors though
 van7hu: chrisbster you can suspend to ram instead of hdd for instance...
 chrisbster: it does
 chrisbster: van7hu you combine suspend to disk with suspend to ram....
 chrisbster: van7hu that way it goes fast and if you lose power completely it's ok
 chrisbster: something like that...benefits of both
 chrisbster: is he trying to increase hibernate shutdown or power up
 bison: still there?
 chrisbster: nvm then lol i misread the first line
 chrisbster: what i said would increase startup (or did for me) by a lot
 chrisbster: bison uhm where we at with the pastebin
 chrisbster: what's the default suspend method? uswusp? perhaps compcache mixed with that?
 chrisbster: van7hu ever try using compcache with uswusp...that'd suspend pretty fast?
 bison: what can't you do
 Blackflowers: what's the problem
 Blackflowers: other than a generic description of "lock up"
 bison: chrisbster which part didn't work?
 whatisthat: that depends on your window manager
 bison: ?
 Feyisayo: nvidia?
 bison: whoami
 bison: type that it'll tell you your username
 bison: apt-cache search pastebin..and pick one
 whatisthat: idk if you can do that in xfce...i know i can in my wm
 Feyisayo: what's your video hardware
 whatisthat: Xmonad
 Feyisayo: ok do they have 3d support with the open source drivers
 shcherbak: you shouldn't
 json: chown and chmod
 bison: ? apt-get install pastebinit
 bison: type that
 json: what else do you need? chown can change group and owner chmod changes execute read and writability of the group user and other
 whatisthat: yes
 bison: you forgot the it at the end
 it's pastebinit
 whatisthat: get xmonad-contrib and xmobar too...you'll want them
 json: chown <user>:<group> <file> <file2>
 bison: and?
 json: chmod <user><group><other> <file> <file2>  777 is everyone can do everything
 json: to set on a directory add a -R after chmod so chmod -R 777 / means everyone can do anything on any file (don't do that...it's suicidal)
 bison: you don't have sudo access?
 json: the -R works on both commands btw
 bison: chrisbster idk i told him run that he didn't give back output
 json: man pages and common command knowledge
 Feyisayo: yes
 bison: chrisbster lol no wonder he can't do anything LOL bison logout (type exit) and login as your user
 json: they're there for a reason :)
 json: theres some bash guides as someone just suggested that might help if you're lazy
 __shai: yeah there is
 Feyisayo: ? if you're using catalyst no wonder it's broken those havn't been updated since like 2004
 Feyisayo: find them in apt then install modprobe -r the existing ones and modprobe up the right ones
 chrisbster: i told him to sudo su - and set a root pw and just use that for now a while ago...
 chrisbster: why not? i ALWAYS have at least 3 root terminals open...and a few user terminals too but...they're needed
 chrisbster: ? his root password is his user password? that's just dumb
 Feyisayo: ctrl alt f1
 Blackflowers: up to you...
 wn1zid: how is installing ubuntu going to help Blackflowers if it's a driver problem he should be asble to fix it in fedora or any other distro as well as ubuntu
 bison: chrisbster ok boot to grub edit the kernel line and add a 1 at the end.  when done booting you'll be at a root terminal type passwd set a password then tytpe telinit 3 to boot the rest of the way into a terminal
 Blackflowers: use the 64 bit....why use 32 when 64 is supported
 vibhav: what was your issue didn't se it sorry
 Feyisayo: when your screen is fubared
 Feyisayo: though sooner probably will still work
 ?
 vibhav: uhm can't help you sorry...don't use ubuntuone
