 Is there an official download of 11.04 2d?
 KM0201, but 2d in particular?
 arand, unity 2d
 arand, I installed ubuntu on my cr-48 and its running kind of sluggish
 I remember there being a 2d
 arand, so that'll allow me to have 3d and 2d available?
 So I just installed Unity 2D on my netbook, but I want to make the icons of the dock smaller. So I went into compiz to go to the plugin to make them smaller and this plugin is disabled. How can I make the icons smaller on unity 2d?>
 ActionParsnip, just... r?
 ActionParsnip, what am I resetting? I'm on unity 2d now... I just want to change the icon size smaller than default.
 Is there any hope in sight for dual screen systems with unity being able to choose which screen the dock is on?
 somethinginteres, the beta did not.
 somethinginteres, it just forced the dock to the far far left, no matter how you stacked your monitors.
 somethinginteres, so for me it was a PITA, because my main monitor is on the right. So my unity dock defaulted to the left... but my left monitor is just for watching news, weather, IMs, email, etc. So I hate to have to swing way over to use that dock.
 somethinginteres, well I heard it was a work in progress. But this was 2 weeks ago. I wasnt sure if anything had changed.
 somethinginteres, will that be part of regular system updates, you think?
 Pici, one exists I believe.
 Bluebill-Wolf, no, it's not. Thank GOD.
 PhoenixSTF, no, it doesn't.
 PhoenixSTF, I have been on Ubuntu since 2005. Ever since day one people have found a way to say it looks like Mac.
 PhoenixSTF, while the global menu is similar to mac, it's not the exact same. that is the *only* similarity. In other words - no, it does not.
 Bluebill-Wolf, because norton sucks. horribly.
 PhoenixSTF, well, no kidding... because maverick is a different version of ubuntu.
 PhoenixSTF, well, yeah. it's a totally different interface.
 PhoenixSTF, with gnome moving towards gnome shell, we would have had to make the change at some point regardless. ubuntu just went with unity instead, which is very similar to gnome shell anyway.
 PhoenixSTF, the important thing is to be open minded. I HATED unity and gnome shell. I used gnome shell at the end of last summer and I hated it. But you know... I used it more. I got to know it. And now that unity is here I'm using it more too.
 PhoenixSTF, it'll take time. there will be headaches, frustrations, etc. But this is a unique opportunity for linux as a whole to provide a new interface that people can interact with differently than windows and mac could ever hope to. love unity or hate it, love gnome shell or hate it, both offer great features i fyou give it the time to adjust.
 PhoenixSTF, that's my opinion, at least.
 PhoenixSTF, like I said, I hated unity and gnome shell for weeks. many weeks.
 PhoenixSTF, but now that I'm getting used to it, I'm turning into a little bit of a fanboy :P
 Is there a way to adjust Ubuntu so it doesnt require a PW when resuming from suspend mode?
 I have Firefox on Ubuntu 11.04, but I do not have an import/export option in the "show all bookmarks menu." Does anybody know how else I can import my bookmarks?
 What is Unity's relationship to Ubuntu? Can Unity be installed on other Linux Distributions or is it exclusive to Ubuntu Only?
 escott, sounds like its Ubuntu only just for now
 cdbs, good deal man. I didn't know Fedora was tinkering with it.
 cdbs, when you say debian folks were interested, you're talking about just making unity possible on that platform, not the default, right?
 cdbs, do you think theyll default it? It sounds like most others were more interested in gnome shell as the default
 cdbs, from what I gathered, at least.
 conorhogan, yes
 conorhogan, its like CTRL ALT arrow or something
 cdbs, my apologies.
 Question - I can't set Chromium to be my default browser in 11.04. When I select it in the preferences menu, nothing happens. When I open Chromium, it asks me every time if I want to make it my default. Regardless of what I say, it keeps asking me each time I open it. Any ideas?
 macross, copying what?
 macross, hardly.
 macross, the global menu is similar, but works differently. That's the *only* similarity.
 macross, I've used Ubuntu since 2005. Ever since I started, people somehow found in their twisted minds something to say about how Ubuntu was copying Mac. Ever. Since. Day. One.
 It's old, and a dead horse.
 The global menu, yes it's similar, but not identical. The similarities pretty much stop there.

 tdn, I think the netbook remix is gone, since its so similar to what the regular desktop is now.
 Is there a way to create hotkeys to reduce/raise backlight brightness on laptops? I don't have function keys for it on this particular laptop. :(
 How can I adjust my brightness on my laptop? This laptop does not have any dedication function keys on the keyboard.

 Mitsukaru, I only have that option on AC power, not battery. :(
