 hi
 do you know about compatibility for installating ubuntu on a macbook pro ?
 do you know if the drivers support all the hardware ?
 hi
 anybody is using ubuntu on macos ?
 I just want to make sure all the drivers are working fine
 Damianz, my mistake I meant on macbookpro
 not mac os
 DamienCassou, did everything worked fine ?
 bin_bash, ModelIdentifier: MacBookPro 5,4
 I just can't get used to mac os
 I have been on linux for over a decade
 miss my gnome too much
 ok great I will try to install it then I just don't want to waste time if I have to switch back later
 I will just resize the original partition first
