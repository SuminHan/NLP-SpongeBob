 has anybody had any issues installing 11.04?
 random restart during installation...
 is there a way to pull up what may be erroring here when the system restarts suddenly at about 60% through the installation of 11.04 64-bit?
 anybody running 11.04 on a single core? lol
 this is VERY laggy during installation, and restarts after a while every time...the system is stable...
 This is an Opteron 144 with 2gb of RAM...
 while installing system on 64-bit 11.04, the system restarts suddenly. no error. just a restart...
 is anybody going to answer what might be going on with my installation???
 alright! I made it past the "you must restart your computer to use your new installation" !!! then it locked up while stopping services?
 what is wrong with 11.04???
 yes! i've been trying to install 11.04 64-bit for the past few hours, and it has restarted each time, getting a little further every time...
 but not completing the installation
 It's acting like the system is unstable for the most part, but it's rock solid
 random reboots/locking up.
 how is the support for ULi chipsets? was the very little support that existed in previous versions dropped or anything?
 w00t. I have a desktop!
 and unity! and restricted drivers!
 quick question! any suggestions for a hardware stress test for 11.04?
 THANKS FOR IGNORING ME
 NVidia drivers "activate" but aren't in use. 6600le on 11.04. thoughts?
 NVidia drivers "activate" but aren't in use. 6600le on 11.04. I've tried both versions that show up in the proprietary drivers window. what's going on?
