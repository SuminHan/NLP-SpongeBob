 compdoc: I guess I should've mentioned that it's a laptop with a single harddrive -- so I have no idea how the problem occurred
 compdock: yes, but it's all on the single harddrive,
 Aye, I'm on my stationary at the moment, but I'm able to access the windows partition. And I'll try with the live CD.
 compdoc: what program in particular?
 I'm going to use the LiveCD to boot into Ubuntu 10.10, do I actually need the 10.10 CD, or will a new 11.04 work as well?
 mbeierl: thank you. :)
 Does anyone know the location of the Ubuntu desktop, origining from [xx GB Filesystem]? Or is that not how it works?
 I'm currently on a LiveCD, due to my regular Ubuntu partition not working -- how would I go ahead and *fix* the regular one now?

 coz_: Correct. :) It actually doesn't find the harddrive. http://paste.ubuntu.com/602816/ in particular.
 When I'm going to run "sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/repair", should the sdax be of my regular partition, or the one I'm currently on?
 Does anyone know where the "Rescue System" is? On the LiveCD, that is.
