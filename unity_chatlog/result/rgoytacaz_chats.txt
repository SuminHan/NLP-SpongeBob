 Hello there, Just installed 11.04 on my Vosto 3300 and it didnt install the nvidia drivers. so no flashiness. Is it working?
 dasy2k1: aditional drivers?
 dasy2k1: says its currently activated but not in use.
 dasy2k1: it error'd out during installation
 dasy2k1: will try, brb.
 dasy2k1: just one more thing, Im on sdd, is it on automatic trim by default? or should I just do that same procedure for 10.04?
 dasy2k1: thanks :)
 dasy2k1: Cant remove the driver, says InstallArchives() failed.
 Any had any luck with Nvidia Drivers for ubuntu 11.04?

 Well, Ubuntu 11.04 works only post-install if you try to restart it fails and doesnt boot anymore
 Also NVidia drivers, ONCE AGAIN, doesn't work on release, this is getting annoying.
 and Im on certified hardware. :(
 celthunder: if oss works well, why does Ubuntu choose to install the nvidia one by default? Dont we learn?
 celthunder: wow, whats that for? free aggression?
 celthunder: take that to wtv you live, not here.
 Jordan_U: I know, but from my experience we always have problems with that driver, maybe an option which we can choose between during install, maybe it work okay.
 anyways, I'm trying for the 3rd time a install using different parameters, let see what happens.
 Anyone figured out the shutdown/boot problems?
 cntb: dont upgrade yet :)
 Install Failed: ERROR: modinfo: could not find module nvidia_current
 thats what I get during install of 11.04
 ERROR: could not find module vmxnet
 Anyone knows the cause why you can't shutdown/boot Ubuntu 11.04 after install?

 celthunder: yea, it says crash manager something fails
 So Installing 11.04 without download the updates seems to work for me.
 So no updates for a long time.
 But nvidia still doesnt work.
 So I removed the nvidia driver, which said that it couldnt display Unity and the default OSS does display, fuck nvidia.

 Is there a way to go back to post-install state in Ubuntu?
 thats why i dont like religion, there are too many fanatics, I'm all inclined to believe in good will and thats it.
