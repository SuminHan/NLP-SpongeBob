 those aren't bugs...those are lack of features
 KrisDouglas I don't even use ubuntu anymore...i have it installed on my laptop but i triple boot and my main is now CrunchBang...i recommend it...total control and everything works
 oh
 hehe...well...hopefully Unity gets the features it needs
 KrisDouglas i agree...not ready...but they wanted to push it out to have something to show...so they got the bugs out, but added nothing to make deadline...   I hate right-clicking and getting nothing.
