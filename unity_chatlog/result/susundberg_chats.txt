 thats not the case if it complains about character encoding
 i guess problem is that it has some weird encoding -- "What Windows terminology calls "ANSI encodings" are usually single-byte ISO-8859 encodings, except for in locales such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean that require double-byte character sets."
