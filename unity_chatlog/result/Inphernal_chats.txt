 Hey all, trying to upgrade 10.10 64bit to 11.04, I get "E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages." after waiting a while during "setting new software channels" step of upgrader
 I've looked onlien, but couldn't find any solutions, just other people experiencing the problem
 greenlantern: "11.04 is considered to be a major release for Ubuntu because it represents a significant departure from the default GNOME UI to the new Unity UI."
 km0201: Haha it does scroll pretty fast xD

 jbicha: I'm pretty sure I removed all but the original ones, how can I check and let you know which I have
 jbicha: Got it, kept opening in a funny window not allowing me to copy. http://paste.ubuntu.com/601579/
 jbicha: I'm looking in the repositories section in synaptic package manager, and it seems the wine, firefox, and a couple other http://ppa.launchpad... are still there, even though I clicked remove on all of them, is there a specific way I need to do this?
 jbicha: That's ok, thank you for trying
