 hello guys ! Since I installed Naty, the Display on my monitor is ok but on my TV it is "greenish". The same hardware was perfect under maverick. Any idea ?
 Hi ! After installing Natty, the display on my is green/pink but is perfect on my monitor. I tested many different configurations without success. All was working perfectly under Maverick. Does anyone have an idea please ?
 Intel
 no
 lcb, no proprietary drivers
 TV display is green/pink but the monitor display is perfect. They are behind a hdmi splitter
 The same config worked perfectly under Maverick.
 During the system boot the TV image is perfect until unity or gnome starts
 pragmaticenigma, exactly the same:with or without splitter
