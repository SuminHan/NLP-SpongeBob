 I want to install windows 7 (for moms :) ), but I would like to keep grub as the bootloader, is it possible to change the crappy bootloader from the_crappy_os_I_will_not_write ? :)
 I don't want to know how, i just want to know if I can or can't :)
 escott, is this thing simple to do? :)
 escott, thanks :)
 guys, I have to mount some movies in .iso format, can someone please tell me what application should I use? :) (something equivalent to Daemon tools on windows)
 spyhermit, I mean, I don't just want to mount the .iso, because then I would have Audio_TS and Video_TS (or something similar), I would want to autoplay the image :)
 Dr_Willis, spyhermit vlc is on linux too? wow :) Nice, thanks guys
