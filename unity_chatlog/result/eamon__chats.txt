 how safe is an encrypted home partition?
 the regular installer
  ecryptfs the default one that is used in the ubuntu installer
 rgr: ecryptfs
 sorry to ask this again but does anyone know how secure ecryptfs is?
 ohsix: ok thanks i was just wondering because since it only encrpyts your home directory i was worried that there maybe sensitive data stored in other parts of the partition is this true?
 ohsix: are all privite files stored in the home directory such as logs?
