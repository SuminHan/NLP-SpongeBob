 Hi, I cannot download restricted extras and vlc from software center or apt. It gives error that problem with fetching, while my connection is okay, and also the repo address, I tried main server.
 jrib: Okay, will try later later, currently downloading Skype.
 jrib: done with that update, but still doesn't work.
 jrib: I tried sudo apt-get install vlc
 jrib: here it is: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=WYTeHWxP
 jrib: Okay, changing to US mirror.
 jrib: Thanks, US repo worked, still wondering why main sever caused me a problem. :)
 jrib: Thats explains it. Thanks. See you later I hope.
