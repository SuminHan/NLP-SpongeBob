 ssav: if you know the root password then why can't you login as your normal user and su root?

 OverTheHillAndFa: give that a shot and see if it helps on reboot
 leagris: do "ccsm"
 OverTheHillAndFa: cool
 Superstar: start menus have always been in top left or bottom left
 OverTheHillAndFa: yea just let it finish, I interrupted mine the other day and rebooted anyway and all was fine, but I'd try and let it finish anyway
 flash sucks in general

 jnlsnl_: make sure the script is set to executable
 plustax: "sudo do-release-upgrade"
 trijntje: it won't break anything if it's still in the downloading phase

 jnlsnl_: you have to set the executable bit that way to run scripts

 gaurav_sood91: "sudo do-release-upgrade"
 nutsfornatty: somebody should add that to the topic
 Shoogy: it is no more
 Shoogy: the normal desktop version is the new "netbook" version, it's the same now.  unity is a good interface for the netbook so it should be fine
 Dominater: it has compiz
 Dominater: it's in the settings, but my computer can't run it so I haven't turned it on
 Kevin147: stable as of today
 nastjuid: you can do that with the normal cd
 nastjuid: when you go to log in, you can select "Ubuntu Classic" for your session
 jumbers: I'd recommend just burning the ISO and doing the upgrade from the boot

 happyface: when you go to log in, choose "Ubuntu Classic" as your session

 JediMaster: no it runs on top of gnome
 Wolver1n3: nothing in your /home should be deleted during an upgrade
 is there a way to do full disc encryption with natty desktop?  I saw the option in server install, but not desktop
 ohsix: ?
 acicula: ah, ty
 ohsix: it's for my laptop
 ohsix: that doesn't really help if I delete sensitive information without encrypting it
 in the case of a powered off laptop, full disc encryption is essentially fullproof in case of theft, which is my main concern
 ohsix: we'll have to agree to disagree in this particular instance, but I do appreciate your input :)
 mithridates: it's stable on my nvidia
 mithridates: do I did a fresh instally, but yes I'm very happy with natty
