 just 4 interest: is the natty boot time also significantly shorter than maverick ones on your computers
 okay..did not start with below lucid so i cannot tell but i read it
 but for my netbook it made ~2/3 of the old time
 DasEi, i set up my computer 3 times in 5 months now..lts is not a big deal for a small surfing only machine
 !autoremove
 lets seee
 not
 !autoclean
 hmmh...how was that dpkg command?
 can i search for terminal commands in the "history". like i knew i started programm1 and nedd all parameters back?
 nice..more time to be saved. thanks
 wojei, its a little dangerous if i may note that..mine crashed on boot afterwards(two machines)
 nbf, they only tired to copy windows....windows has become so sucessful with early beta's! (sorry kidding)
 MaxFrames, https://launchpad.net/grub-customizer worked for me. but i am sure someone knows the right file to do a text edit to change default
 MaxFrames, /boot/grub/grub.cfg in maverick..but check if its the same on natty(grub 2 so should)
 tastywheat, either because of upgrade (no idea) or because you did choose the wrong session(login screen) or because 3d hardware is not present/configured?
 JoshDreamland, which brand?
 ah ok JoshDreamland i had the trouble with samsung..lukcily 2.6.39 kernel will support samsung(finally)
 can i replace maverick with natty without upgrade? (and keep windows dualboot undamaged)
 good to know..i did not want to but now my maverick's nearly broken compeltely why no
 KM0201, can i clean install and only keep /home/myfolder or is that wanted too much
 hi. i installed natty and it failed to install the bootloader(omg). so i would do a grub-install device manually but two questions: a) will it detect my windows partition b)how do i find out where to install(raid controller..so /dev/sda is just one of two raid discs, natty is on /dev/dm-4. where does it go best?)
 or how do i find existing grub's(the old one loads but goes to rescue mode)
 so how do i find out which /dev is my raid? (i suppose the grub needs to go there)
 hi. my banshee music is on my ntfs windows drive. how can i automount it on booting?
 okay..
 can i also do mount command into rc.local?
 ok..ill do that
 hi. is there a tool to track(=txt or graphic) the cpu usage of a selected task?
 jatt does it make a log?
