 Hey all.  In the middle of upgrading from 10.10 -> 11.04; got told to consider submitting a bug report about monodoc-base failing to install.  Where do I report this bug?
 ohsix: thanks.
 anybody else had issues with the monodoc-base package during the upgrade, yet?
 it looks like there are a bunch of bugs about it in Launchpad
 hey gang, I'm doing the update through the X gui; where do I grep for errors?
 would it be on dmesg..?
 I'll be doing another report this term and it's not even an official co-op term
 done six already
 mischan; sorry =X
 Any reason I should have gotten this error while upgrading? "The upgrade has aborted. Your system could be in an unusable state. A recovery will run now (dpkg --configure -a)."
 ChronicSyncope: yeah, I know. :) But I didn't cancel the installation, and the only problem was with monodoc-base.
 Hi all.  The upgrade from 10.10 -> 11.04 really messed up my system and I would just love some help getting my computer to even reach the BIOS.
 zachgretzinger: Given that my computer barely boots, I'm not sure how to answer that question.  How can I find out what you're asking?
 zachgretzinger: I mean, I can't even reach GRUB to boot my Windows partititon.
 *partition
 zachgretzinger: I turn it on, and the screens receive zero input.  Not even the screen that the BIOS puts out saying, "I'm booting up!" before I see GRUB.
 When I say it says "I'm booting up", I mean that figuratively.
 It actually has the motherboard logo on it, and so on.
 zachgretzinger: I will cross my fingers.
 zachgretzinger: Unfortunately, I have no sandwiches, and without a terminal I can't order my roommate to make me one.
 zachgretzinger: Any other ideas? multiple hard reboots have been unsuccessful so far.
 zachgretzinger: if I could boot, maybe I could wipe my drive...
 zachgretzinger: even though I really don't want to.
 zachgretzinger: I apologize if I get snarky; it's not you, it's my computer, and it's very late for me.  Please don't take it personally.
 zachgretzinger: No, although I think I could manage a LiveCD.
 zachgretzinger: although, again, not sure how I'm going to boot from it.
 zachgretzinger: Heh, sounds like some of my coworkers this summer.  Haven't met any of them yet, but they're german and working in NYC.
 zachgretzinger: install it on.. my unbooting computer..?
 oh, I see
 OK, so use Unetbootin to create a DSL bootable thumb drive?
 thanks zachgretzinger, truepurple.  I think I'm going to pass out for now and grapple with this some more in the morning.
 Looks like any plans of playing Portal 2 tonight will have to wait.
