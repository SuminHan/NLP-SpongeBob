 sudo update-manager should download something if I'm on beta2, right?
 how do I upgrade from beta2 to release?
 iceroot, that ownly downloads one package, is that correct?
 only*
 :(
 iceroot, okay, thanks
 In my update-manager, the check fails because some of the PPAs I added don't have natty versions yet (I'm on beta2). Will this affect me being able to upgrade to release?
 zvacet, hm ok thx
 mala85: the PPA for gnome shell crashes Unity, true, so Kubuntu could be nice
 sebsebseb: but using the PPA will crash Unity, so one should be careful with it
 will break is more correct x)
 !ask | mmjunaid
 oh sorry
 didn't see it
 JaymesKeller: did it work for you under 10.10?
 any1 instantly knows how to disable join/quit messages in irssi?
 ohsix: thanks
 cool upgrade is taking about 3 hours to complete :@ that will be 5 am here ...
 lcb: already downloaded, install is taking 3 hours
 lcb: yes
 lcb: seems true :p ~1900 packages to upgrade :D
 lcb: than it's just my 5400 rpm hdd I think (+ 1.8 ghz dualcore)
 lcb: yes I'm afraid of that, probably will just leave it running while sleeping :)
 thebigroflz: what's the problem?
 lcb: I'll freak out if I get up and it still says 2h to go, do you want to do that and that ;D
 oh but it probably will do as some config files etc from grub got modified :@
 ah a question just came to my mind: Is it better to use the new config file, for example for GRUB, than my 'old', modified one?
 lcb: I'll try, thanks :)
 Is it better to use the new 11.04 config file, for example for GRUB, than my 'old', modified one?
 escott: colour + background changes, but other configs eg samba are somewhat more modified
 escott: okay, thanks
 escott: okay, thank you
 lcb: :D and then I'll wake up and my grub is destroyed *fears* :D
 lcb: thanks a lot
 lcb: I don't worry that much I think, it should all go well (says the optimist)
 !lts
 ah fine

 daxroc: ah okay, thanks
 BlouBlou: yes I have that already, just didn't know I had to enable the switcher. THanks a lot :)

 NeoCicak: should be possible with compizconfig-settings-manager
 NeoCicak: for the terminal, yes, for unity settings you have too look at the ubuntu-unity plugin
 trash can* not terminal, sorry
 NeoCicak: there should be an icon telling "Ubuntu Unity Plugin"
 NeoCicak: but give me a sec I'm trying to find sth
 NeoCicak: then try relogging :)
 sudo nano /usr/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop
 whoops
 wrong tab
 Incarus6: I know :D but didn't want to spam the channel with crap :)
 Incarus6: no! :D
 nishanth: alt + f2 -> ccsm maybe?
 nishanth: tried logging into classic ubuntu and there enabling the unity plugin in ccsm?
 botcity: I think it has under preferences | reset to defaults
 but never tried it :)
 osmosis_paul: you need to registered and join ##java afaik
 botcity: If he gets into ccsm, yes, maybe
 !chroot > boneseer
 !kenrel > Naphidia
 !kernel > Naphidia
 sorry
 Soothsayer: you may resize it if it's too big for you :)
 botcity: ccsm -> unity -> change icon size
 !gnome3 > kjesle
 botcity: no problem :) Worked fine for me
 Soothsayer: Alt + f2
 mvip: did you tell your system to look for non-LTS-releases?
 mvip: no
 Soothsayer: Alt F2
 toggles: compizconfig-settings-manager installable via sudo apt-get install
 mikebot: if you're not on some complicated disk layout, they should be visible in nautilus by default
 mikebot: for me they're under devices in nautilus
 mikebot: okay, that sound complicated to me. Not even sure how that is possible
 sounds*
 ah ok :D
 coz_: it runs fine on dual-display for me
 is there any way to execute a terminal command from within irssi?
 Dr_Willis: thank you
 Is it normal that there's no start splash while booting?
 Incarus6: hahaha :D
 ssh server client?
 jw_: I updated two computers and experienced no problems
 Hey, I remember someone asked that already today but I didn't get the solution: When I click "Shutdown" in 11.04, it just simply logs me out instead of really shutting down, but "sudo shutdown -h now" works fine. Any ideas or do I have to search the log?

 remlabm: no more difference between desktop and netbook afaik
 !info supybot

 txomon: yes ok but wyh doesn't the shtudown button work
 good evening everyone :)
 Caly: be patient
 klunky999: just tell your problem and we'll se who can help you
 coolkid25: what's your problem?
 alteregoa: depends on many things, very bad to predict
 alteregoa: also depends on the load of the server, your internet connection, your hdd speed and your CPU speed
 alteregoa: cool so you got some kind of light processor? would be km, then
 alteregoa: I can just tell you that the simple installation of the packages took 3 hours on my laptop and one hour one my desktop, you have to add download time
 Acriax: try booting into classic ubuntu and reset everything to default in the compizconfig-settings-manager
 Acriax: if you're still having troubles, try http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/how-to-reset-unity-launcher-icons-or.html
 man so many ppas with no natty versions, kinda annoying on apt-get update :)
 coz_: oh I have that installed too, but didn't know it had that function. Thanks!
 bencc: either openjdk-jre or sun-java6-jre
 !java > bencc
 tomatobros: you should enable the proprietary drivers in the hardware admin section and then it should download it without you requiring to get it from amd.com but
 !ati > tomatobros
 lovebug: either via !screen or as an init script
 lovebug: you ssh into the server?
 lovebug: okay, I'll pm you
 !screen
 Acriax: yey, no problem :)
 steve1: not all, but some afaik. Try compizconfig-settings-manager
 !ccsm | steve1
 steve1: I'm not sure but I think these are all you can modify. There was a user today asking something similar, but I don't remember if he found a solution, maybe you can look through the channel logs
 dios_mio: it will break Unity, just fyi
 dios_mio: yes, if it works fine for you than it's no problem that it breaks unity :)
 dios_mio: than it may be fine for yoU :)
 I'd actually like to try the new gnome shell but I won't risk breaking Unity :( Anybody knows if building gnome-shell from source also breaks Unity?
 BiosElement: Hm, okay. So I'll have to use a VM as soon as I get back to my desktop
 coreire: grub2 didn't come with 11.04, actually, I'd say using legacy is not good at all
 coreire: I had that running fine some time again but I can't remember the exact line for the menu.lst, sorry. Maybe google will help you there :)
 !grub1 | coreire
 maybe
 kpoman: is it just logging you out instead of rebooting/shutting down?
 kpoman: okay same for me :@, didn't find a solution yet
 cool we're not alone :)
 !downgrade

 steve1: oh cool, thanks
 stravant: may be a problem with your theme, had that too

 crlcan81: I have only 1mbit down here ... took 5 hours even to dl :D
 man how I hate pressing ctrl alt f12 instead of just f12
 BKTech86: you managed to boot into ubuntu?
 BKTech86: you might be able to chroot and then completely purge and reinstall grub see !chroot
 BKTech86: apt-get remove --purge grub* and then reinstall grub or grub-legacy
 BKTech86: if you chroot correctly, it should be possible (sorry I'm no expert with chrooting)
 BKTech86: yes I think that should be possible
 BKTech86: that's what chroot is for, isn't it?
 BufferUnderpants: yep, no problem here
 BKTech86: I'm not sure but I don't think so

 Flare183: doesn't matter, ot is ot

 dibs: here
 Guest68551: run it from terminal with sudo in front

 I'm off, good night everyone
 greylurk_: so ture

 Cleaver: did you download it from the official site? Client or server?
 Cleaver: no need to install, just ./ts*****_runscript start (don't remember the exact name)
 Cleaver: or was it _startscript? NO idea, sorry :p
 Cleaver: no, you whould have a ts3client_startscript or sth like that
 Cleaver: just download .tar.gz, extract it and start the starscript with the "start" argument
 Guest51304: you may have to ask on the Gnome IRC, google for it (sorry don't know the exact channel/network, should be irc.gnome.org)

 is it possible to write a message in pidgin via the terminal? Would be nice for a drop down terminal while being on another workspace
 sakuramboo: cool, thanks I'll see if I find something
 sakuramboo: I found a program called finch, did you use that?
 !info finch
 sakuramboo: thanks a lot :)
 wow except that it doesn't seem to recognize my skype it's pretty awesome :)
 sakuramboo: :-) I recently got to like irssi as I can start it in guake and "take it" to every workspace which is sometimes required when having only one display available :)
 sakuramboo: so thanks for the tip :)
 sakuramboo: oy, nice idea, thanks. Instantly going to start it on an available server :)
 sakuramboo: I got an online backup server running debian, so I'll use that. Thank you very much this is a great idea :)
 brb ;-)
 yey it works
 is there an option to execute a command upon login via ssh?
 botcity: okay, thanks, will try that
 hm when I ssh into the machine, .bashrc somehow doesn't get executed, only when I manually invoke bash, although the shell I'm using on login is bash. Any ideas?
 escott: sorry, didn't understand that?
 carl-m: over ssh
 escott:ah oky, thanks, will look into that
 carl-m: no just ssh hostname -l login
 Hm it still runs the command only when I manually invoke bash
 !es | felipeh
 took another machine, works there fine. yey
 tortoise: that means that the ppa probably doesn't have any packages for lucid lynx yet

 wow irc with iphone and issh :-) successful day  good night all
 Hi, is there an option to tell irssi to set away automagically after, say 30 min, and change the nick?
 Pelo: ok ...
 Abbas-uB: maybe because servers are overloaded cause of many updaters
 oneliner: there may be a way
 oneliner: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/04/compiz-cube-natty/ but use this on your own risk

 Now that I read it, does the plymouth splash screen thingy still exist in natty? Doesn't seem to work for me
 Rehan: I see my GRUB background and that's it :) but I think the opposite of splash is nosplash
 Rehan: mh dunno, had to fix sthing in 10.10 as well, but splash also doesn#t work on my 11.04 ATI notebook so it might just be all proprietary drivers ...
 Rehan: yes, it worked vor me in 10.04 and 10.10 but not anymore :(
