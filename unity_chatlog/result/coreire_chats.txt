 Hey, I'm having a little trouble with grub. I have Ubuntu 11.04, Windows 7, and Mandriva 2010.2 installed. I installed ubuntu last and installed the bootloader along with it. When I choose Windows 7 from the menu the system immediately reboots. I've tried the system tools on the Windows 7 disc and it says it can't find any problem with the windows installation. Any ideas on what I should do? Thanks
 Also, i've tried "update-grub" but it's still the same
 I'm having trouble getting anything but Ubuntu to boot with grub2 that came with ubuntu 11.04. I've just installed grub legacy. Can anyone tell me the correct lines to add to menu.lst to get my windows 7 partition to boot? It's on /dev/sda1
 KNUBBIG: I'm just trying it as a last resort. Every time i select windows the system just reboots back to grub
 I've formatted, partitioned, and reinstalled the os's multiple times, in different orders, and it's just driving me nuts at this stage lol
 KNUBBIG: Tried that already, but thanks
 rgr: Windows 7, Ubuntu 11.04, Mandriva 2010.2.
 rgr: did that. it breaks windows and mandriva
 rgr: System reboot instantly on choosing windows. mandriva complains that the root partition is not set correctly
 rgr: I'm starting to agree. I might just go back to 10.10
 Hey, I'm trying to reinstall grub after installing windows. I've installed grub to the drive and it says everything went ok, but when I run "update-grub" it responds with "/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot stat `aufs'."

 I'm installing grub from the 11.04 live-cd using this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows. When I install grub it says it went ok, but no grub.cfg is created. If I run "sudo update-grub" I get the error "/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot stat `aufs'"
