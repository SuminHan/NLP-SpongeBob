 any reports of ubuntu 11.04 not booting completely from the install cd?  i get an ubuntu boot background and a cursor... thats it.
 amrinz: just burnt it
 on new cd-r media
 *sigh* who's idea was it to disable ctl+alt+f1-f8 ?
 amrinz: hmm.. ok will try to reburn
 amrinz: seems the unity interface isn't starting
 amrinz: i started the cd on another system and it worked fine
 i hear the ubuntu start up sound... then things just sit there
 will the live cd / unity fail if it is using a non-accelerated video driver?
 KM0201: if you ment me... 5GB
 Ati radeon HD
 4350 i think
 k.  is there any way to see syslogs or access a terminal?
 ctl+alt+fX would be *inifitely* useful atm
 k.
 thanks for the infos
 KM0201: aren't radeon's pretty common?
 not any more.. the recent radeon xorg drivers work pretty well
 are there plans to move away from unity towards gnome 3 at any point?
 cause thus far it has been hit or miss... and gnome 3 is pretty awesome
 s$#%$#
 ok.. back to debian i go
