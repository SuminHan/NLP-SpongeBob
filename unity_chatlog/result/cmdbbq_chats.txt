 I am a bit new to unity (it didn't run well on my netbook in the last release, but it does now) I have a few questions about it to help me get it set up . first off, I was able to swap banshee for rhythmbox in the sound meenu, but i am having trouble accomplishing the same effect with empathy/pidgin in the messaging menu. can anyone help me to do this?
 _genuser_: i am speaking of the revamped notification are, and my side panel autohides or else it would have been a dealbreaker
 so that is a no on adding pidgin to the messaginn menu on right side of the top panel thing? my second question is this then, the top panel thing shows the name of the focused window, but can be made to switch to the menu bar for said window via the alt key or moving the mouse over it. I want it to always be the menu bar. possible?
 ok, i got pidgin into the messaging menu by enabling the libnotify plugin, now i just need to get empathy (listed as "chat") to go away. any ideas on how i would do that?
 M13up: if you click the ubuntu logo or tap super you get an integrated menu geared towards search and then as you type stuff in it will find whatever program you want
 or there is an "applications" entry in the dock on the left and you can look for see all applications or something like that
 installed: 91 more results is what it says M13up
 M13up: I don't know how to get the old catagories view, if that is even still possible, but Applications on the menu bar and then clicking on where it says see more results next to installed should get you a full list to look at
 M13up: on the left side dock, it looks like a magnifying glass with an addition sign in the lense
 how do you go to the desktop/minimize all windows in unity?
