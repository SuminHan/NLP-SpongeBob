 Hello all :)
 Looking for some support on 10.10 11.04 upgrade -> 2011-04-28 22:17:13,336 ERROR NvidiaDetection returned a error: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'datadir'
 did you find a work arround mate?
 Anyone with nvidia error while calculating the changes?
 Galvatron this is durring the upgrade i'm still in 10.10
 Galvatron: snif, I was wishing to not reinstall from scratch!! :'(
 Galvatron: All my programs and configs for couple of years :p
 Galvatron backing up my banshee musicdatabase and all applications will be a pain
 Galvatron yep
 is it hard to migrate the home drive?
 8GB for / and rest for /home?
 would be great and easy if I had space available on my HD :/
 have to make space no choice
 cheers man, have a look at it
 zvacet crazy idea, what do you think about remapping /home on a USB HD, rezise disk and remap to the new partition? possible or stupid?
 sound like challenge :)
