 Hello guys,
 Guys, i get last Ubuntu (Natty amd64), and i want to install some indicator-applets (like cpufreq) on Unity,
 i found it's possible ((http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/01/the-omg-guide-to-must-have-indicator-applets/), but just installing don  make them appear  near the clock
 Can anyone help me with indicator-applets?
