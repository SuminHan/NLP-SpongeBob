 Hi all, I install gnome3 on Ubuntu 11.04, how to remove "Windows key" from global binding? Since Alt+F1 same as "Windows key"
 Thaks! :)
 Anybody know how to remove "windows key" from gnome3?
 Or how to customize keyshort in Gnome3, any tool?
 Damn, i hate Gnome3 eat my "windows key"
 coz_: Gnome-shell with Ubuntu-11.04
 coz_: I binding so many "windows key shortcut" on Emacs, i hate Gnome3 binding "windows key", do you know any way to remove "windows key" ? Since I can use Alt+F1 too.
 coz_: Even hacking way? I guess gnome developer must have some code do those?
 coz_: or they hard-coding it?
 I shouldn't install Ubuntu-11.04 or Gnome3
 I'm a keyboard guy, i hate any system eat my keyshortcut and i even can't chane it.
