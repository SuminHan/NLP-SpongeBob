 Hi, I'm having problems installing ubuntu 11.04 as a dual boot on my friends' computer.
 WHen running wubi, it complains about having no hard disk inserted.
 I simply click continue till I get through the installer. I reeboot, and it just spits out grub and a list of commands
 I know that my friend did have boot manager software intalled .
 help?
 ok.
 !additude

 !repeat

 ubuntu_user, i have the same problem
 how do I do that?
 ok thanks
