 Ubuntu, I upgraded to 11.04 from 10.10, running a custom 2.39 kernel and the Nvidia beta.  After I allowed the upgrade I am getting the Nvidia API error.  Should I recompile my custom Kernel again?
 2.6.39*
 If I'm running a custom kernel and I did the 11.04 upgrade should I recompile my kernel or is it ok?
