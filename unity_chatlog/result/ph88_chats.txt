 how do i setup my connectiong to connect through a proxy server ?
 how can i make a connection through a proxy server ?
 i have ubuntu 11.04 i would like to use a proxy to redirect all traffic of a certain network interface
 i want to use my nokia n900 as modem, but i can't get it to connect, the vodafone information page says i need to use a proxy, but i don't know where to enter this information
 i will have a look lcb
 lcb i don't want to setup a proxy server, i want to connect to a proxy server provided by my internet provider
 ok thx
 but this is cute :) http://www.betavine.net/bvportal/resources/datacards/netbooks/eeepc
 how do i setup a connection with a crosscable to my NAS ? my nas has samba support (and also linux network TFS but not sure)
 correction i mean NFS instead of TFS
 how do i mount my NAS? it has samba and NFS support, i am using a crosscable
 Dr_Willis: yes i mean a crossover cable, i'm not sure if it gets an ip
 Dr_Willis: may i query you ?
 how do i block users from querying me? I am using Ubuntu 11.04 with empathy (IRC network ofcourse)
 Dr_Willis: yes a DHCP server is needed since this is what the NAS expects, i'll check soon if i can find any tutorials on it. Thx (i assumed this functionally would work out of the box)
 mman yes i could give the NAS a static ip, but since i can't access the webinterface now ... i cant set this up
 Dr_Willis: good idea, i will use a static IP next time :)
 the ubuntu software server listed some DHCP frontend ---- awesome !
 i want to recover some files and i already have the byte offset ... now i want to do a raw read ... should i use dd, dd_rescue, savehd7, GNU ddrescue or dd_rhelp ??
 i am using SciTE as my text editor ... how do i set it so it opens new files in a new tab and not in a new window ?
