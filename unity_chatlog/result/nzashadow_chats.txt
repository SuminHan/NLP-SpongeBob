 where can I go to get help with the terminal
 E: Type 'sudo' is not known on line 61 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list
 can anyone help?
 how do I fix this?
 should I upgrade to 11.04?
 has anyone tried config fusion?
 hello, I tried out the ubuntu 11.04 live on my stepdad's laptop and it froze on the desktop, anyone have any idea what's wrong?
 not sure how, and all I could do was move the cursor around
 gonna try again, he said his laptop doesn't like booting with his bluetooth usb
 so maybe that was the problem
 oh, well that will just make life easier knowing that anyways lol
 alright, thank you :)
 Chipzzz: how do you boot into the command line?
 ahhh thank you very much
 I would like to know how stable ubuntu 11.04 is as well from the general consensus
 how do I allocate drive space to install ubuntu without affecting the other OS?
