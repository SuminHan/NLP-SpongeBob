 so it mean sdc
 Me I will stick with ubuntu 10.04 and wait for the 12.04, too much issues with 11.04
 cached when gnome 3 will be supported on ubuntu everything will be fine
 well will see now if my install is good
 finally after hour of help thank I have copy paste in my email what you tell me, but the reinstallation solution was way faster  I'm happy to be on my ubuntu 10.04
 freeman the issues of grub was due of the order I install my 2 distribution and the wrong place I have put the grub , by placing grub on sdc grub is mounting on sdc5 anyway the error I did before is too install grub directly on sdc5 instead of sdc
 before ubuntu 8.04 I was always updating only if it was LTS then I try to install every 6 month update I had lot of issues now I know that will continue to install LTS only
 is by our error that we learn
 I still have one issue from the sound, when earphone or headphone are plug the sound come from speaker at the sametime
 but you help me alot today so it will be for next time thank have a great nite all
