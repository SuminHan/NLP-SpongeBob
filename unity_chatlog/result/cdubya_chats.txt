 Is there any way to customize the view in 11.04 to put the dock on the bottom? I tried to set it to left in the ubuntu unity plugin settings in compiz and logged out and logged back in, but it didn't make any difference....
 nsd, so out of curiosity, why the choice to use unity by default? If it's so bad, that is....
 any suggestions on other window managers to look at for 11.04?
 nsd, nice....so you have any suggestions on WM's......
 nsd, so gnome is no more on 11.04?
 nsd, that figures....ok thanks
