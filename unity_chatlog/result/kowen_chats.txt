 Arphetic: Yes.
 It has its own plugin for Compiz, which lets you do some minor adjustments in ccsm.
 (For Unity 3D, at least.)
 Tweak has its own PPA, doesn't it?
 Auriga: Depends on who you ask. :P
 Auriga: Oh, I love Unity, actually. :)
 So far, Natty has been nice to me.
 A lot of people are extremely unhappy with it, though.
 It uses Compiz.
 Unity has its own Compiz plugin, actually, so you can control some aspects of it from ccsm, which is nice.
 I didn't like Unity at first (actually, I wanted to curse at it), but gave it a chance for about a week. Now I think it's pretty awesome, considering how young it is.
 Probably not a bad idea.
 I used to stick with the LTS releases, but lately, I'm feeling a little more adventurous. :P
 axisys: Alt+F2, type "unity --replace" (no quotes).
 axisys: Ah... figured you were in Unity.
 I've had Unity muck up my taskbar with Compiz changes. Did you try running "compiz --replace" instead?
 LAcan: I'd recommend twice your physical memory, personally.
 That's what I do.
 bU1137Pr00f: 11.04 uses GDM2. It's not as easily configurable as the original GDM, but there are some tools you can install to help.
 bUll37Pr00f: Unfortunately, no. I'm at work. :|
 But at least that's something to go off of? :P
 bU1137Pr00f: I'm not sure I know what you mean. In regards to GDM, or...?
 oneliner: Absolutely. :P
 bU1137Pr00f: Ah. I know in previous versions of Ubuntu you could install gdm2setup (or something similar) which would allow you to change the login background and GTK theme.
 bU1137Pr00f: Let me look around for a second.
 bU1137Pr00f: Try this. https://launchpad.net/gdm2setup
