 hi all
 hmm this is weird.. I can not connect to a certain IP (no matter what port)
 but I can ping that IP perfectly
 does ubuntu have some sort of firewall activated by default?
 I can't access a certain IP anymore
 iptables are empty bazhang
 Jordan_U, / Incarus6 iptables and ufw are deactivated - but I still can't access the IP
 hi all
 ati-radeon does not work anymore since latest update

 nobody else having problems with external vga on ubuntu natty?
