 just because natty is released today doesn't mean it's already released and stable
 quick question about natty, when will it ask me between classic gnome and unity?
 while upgrading
 arand: thanks
 was wondering
 meisth0th: i'll be using gnome3 if they force unity
 meisth0th: if g3 doesnt work, then kde
 bigbrovar: and classic install(alternate)
 bigbrovar: ?
 !alternate
 The-Kernel_: gparted from a livecd
 Bluebill-Wolf: yes
 !info clamav
 !version
 nitroxidus: lsb_release  -a
 Fopp: as flipp said, connection or server. you can switch your upgrade server though
 other_max: tried gnome3?
 im going to try it really soon
 is gnome3 supported here?
 yeah im using gnome3 but i get this error on trying to launch nautilus: Gtk-ERROR **: GTK+ 2.x symbols detected. Using GTK+ 2.x and GTK+ 3 in the same process is not supported
 how could i disable one of them?
 superproxy: you do a cd check by going into text mode of the livecd
 need urgent help. i just did a 'partial upgrade' and now i cant log into any GNOME environment.
 it fails
 ok im going to install kde now
 amit: you can still boot into ubuntu classic
 heroprimeremix: impossible for me to do that, i have no cdrom and i cant boot with a usb
 brb screen
 is it safe to remove ubuntu-desktop after installing kubuntu?
 !root
 Soothsayer: sudo rm /etc/[file] but be careful
 is it safe to remove gnome completely after installing kubuntu?
