 Hello.
 Q. Ubuntu Server Dapper Drake - over the last 6 months one of the NICs on the gateway started requiring continuous restarts (modprobe -r).  The gateway has been on-line, non-stop since Jan 2007.  I suspect NIC hardware failure.  Planning to upgrade the server today and replace NIC.  Do you have any suggestions for troubleshooting if NIC is all that's screwy in the machine?
 Thanks in advance.
 Dr_Willis: Yeah.
 Dr_Willis: There is also another odd behavior:  every Saturday at around 2000 PDT / PST, the server stops.  It isn't always at the same exact time, though, and at and cron look clean.
 Dr_Willis: Heh - indeed.
 Dr_Willis: The thing is - the server is at my home in San Francisco and I live in Moscow now :)
 Dr_Willis: So I'm cramming that today, before I head back on Wednesday ;)
 Dr_Willis: Right.  Long story :)
 Dr_Willis: Or rather, I'm lucky to have two homes :)
 Dr_Willis: Another question:  Ubuntu installation is so old that I can't just apt-get upgrade.
 Dr_Willis: Is it *possible* for me to force an upgrade to 10.04 LTS or newer by "wiping out" the current Ubuntu config?
 Dr_Willis: Or should I just backup the service and user accounts, and install from CD?
 Dr_Willis: Yeah, I heard that but I screwed up the repo trying to do that about 18 months ago.
 Dr_Willis: OKi - I'll just back the beast up.  Thanks :)
 Dr_Willis: I'm keeping /home, /etc (for reference) and /var/lib/named for the gateway.  Everything else I don't care.
 Dr_Willis: Thanks for your help.
 Dr_Willis: Oh, and I'll buy a new NIC :)
 Dr_Willis: I appreciate your help :)
 Dr_Willis: 3...?
 Dr_Willis: Oh, for swapping - heh.
 Dr_Willis: Heh.
 Dr_Willis: This is a Tynan/Rackable enterprise server with dual AMD64s.  I don't want to toss it for no reason.  Though I'm thinking it may be faster to just get a new server to replace it and put LTS on it.  Then migrate instead of rebuild.  Then wipe the old one and sell it on Craig's List :)
 Dr_Willis: Which Ubuntu Server should I use?  10.04 LTS or the newer one and just try to stay current with the upgrades?
 Have a nice day peeps :)
 Greetings.
 Q. Can you please tell me which utility will run a memory test on a running system that will report a faulty SIMM?  Headless 1U server in co-lo, Dapper.  Thanks in advance.
 [4-tea-2]: Checking on both - thanks.
 [4-tea-2]: Installing memtester - thanks.
 [4-tea-2]: Would you recommend any number of tests, or just one?  AMD64 3 GHz.
 [4-tea-2]: I meant test runs.
 [4-tea-2]: Coolio - thanks.
 Greetings.
 Ubuntu server 11.  Sole OS on the system, it stops during startup; I think GRUB is waiting for input; can't see because the screen enters a graphical mode and none of the monitors here supports it.  How can I either change the resolution for that screen or prevent GRUB from asking for input?  Pressing Return goes into normal boot on this system.  Thanks in advance.
 Calif: rm yourfile.swp
 Calif: That means that you aborted vi withoug closing the file.  Just remove the .swp and edit again.  Any changes not saved will be lost.
 Calif: vi should also give you the option to (R)ecover the file.
