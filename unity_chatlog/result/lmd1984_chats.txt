 I never used Ubuntu, I always use Windows. So, this is my first time in this operative system. I just have one question, Can I install normally the sims 3 on this release of Ubuntu?
 The truth is that I have no idea if the sims 3 it can be install on Linux.
 I'd really appreciate an answer. Thanks.
 thanks, has been very helpful.
