 So, now that ubuntu has officially jumped the shark with this natty stuff, what distro should I switch to?
 I gave up on unity after about 1 minute in 11.04, however, Natty seems to have broken regular gnome to the point of unusability too.
 So how do I un-break Compiz in natty?  It is literally impossible to move windows without having it explode and start randomly maximizing them and stuff.
 Also, the compiz settings for which windows to scroll and workspace switch are totally broken.
 botcity: I'm attempting to fix it in the compizconfig tool, except that Natty /also/ broke the tool to the point of nonfunctionality
 botcity: That doesn't help, because I need it to set compiz to some sort of /sane/ defaults, not the psychotic insanity in Natty
 botcity: No, I'm saying Natty is broken to the point of unusability even when I log in to "classic ubuntu"
 botcity: Like, I literally can't place windows into positions on the screen, because the WM goes insane and starts maximizing stuff at random like some crazy person designed it
 botcity: I literally can't get the compizconfig tool to work, because the wm is so broken it bounces around and goes off the screen so I can't hit the back button etc
 Jordan_U: Compiz worked fine in 10.10 -- Natty is just unusable.
 Jordan_U: Right, but where are the settings to disable all the Natty insanity?
 Jordan_U: I mean, I can thrash the thing until the tool kind of works, but I'm having a lot of trouble finding out what bizarre settings those crackheads at Canonical came up with in a drug-crazed stupor when they were designing the Natty UI.
 botcity: Of course it wasn't.  I'm using the Natty defaults, and they are an unusable broken WM configuration.
 botcity: I'm trying to find out what sort of bizarre insanity Canonical came up with when they were defining stuff like the edge drag behavior so I can configure it into some sort of minimally useful form
 stefg_natty: Yeah, you're right.
 stefg_natty: I'm just going to reformat tomorrow and install some other OS.  Ubuntu is clearly not going to get any better.
 stefg_natty: Is mint decent?
 Ok, there we go btw: if you disable the "grid" plugin in compiz, it's possible to place windows without the WM going insane on you.
