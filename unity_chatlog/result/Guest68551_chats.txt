 i just installed the latest ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal, and now it doesn't recognize my nvidia video card
 p_res, did it before what?
 yes it came up fine, ran the update and now i have to select safe mode when i boot up
 it tells me to run nvidia-xconfig
 but i'm kind of new to ubuntu and don't know where to run it from,
 tried but let me try again
 when i enter sudo nvidia-xconfig , prompts me for password which i enter then it comes back xconfig command not found
 adios all
