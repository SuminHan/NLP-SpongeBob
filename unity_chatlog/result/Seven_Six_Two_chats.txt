 uh oh. I'm going to have to install 11.04 in order to participate... Is gnome in 11.04 similar enough to 10.10?
 gboers, so no huge surprises?
 gboers, no I tried unity on 10.04. not for me
 shcherbak, well it may take a while. but in, ah, about 1,400 releases from now, I'm going to have the awesomest nick
 I'm sure by then .04-.10 will get old, and they'll switch to the more humane .2-.42 series
 g[r]eek, the newer it is, the more likely it is that there are still bugs. If you *need* it to work, use LTS if you can.
 geet, aren't we all?  ;)
 Roger_Bonjabee, you mean like gray-white-gray-white-gray-white? That would drive me insane. It would reverse every line all up the screen.
 has anyone had/heard about problems with dual-head setups?
 popey, oh nothing yet. I use twinview with absolute positioning so that I can drag from one screen to the other. I haven't gone to 11.04 yet, so I wanted confirmation from at least one person that it can maybe work. I have an nvidia 6800gtoc
 popey, I've downloaded the installer, and was going to try it in vmware, but that won't show me anything useful. unfortunately my only free partition right now is being used by backtrack
 popey, good, thanks. I remember having an ati card, and discovering after an upgrade (long, long ago) that their new driver cut off support for a whole whack of cards, and xfree updated at the same time and required the new ati driver. I was so mad. SO mad.
 I read that the new version of xorg has multipointer functionality built in...
 tenX, a cursor for each input device. 3 mice? you get 3 pointers. all usable at the same time
 for multihead setups? Freaking brilliant. 2 people can use a computer at the same time.
 tenX, if you run a school...or a computer camp, or a library, or an internet cafe, there are a lot of awesome reasons
 I downloaded 11.04 iso. mounted loop. tried to import packages in to apt-cacher, but only 24 were found. ls -R | grep deb   shows 24. Where are all of the debs? Mounted /ubuntu/casper/filesystem/squashfs and grepped again, but no debs. Where does the installer get them from??
 Dr_Willis, I'd do a straight upgrade, but I already downloaded the iso. I'll repack from the live, and it should be ok
 apt made it's name when people pulled their hair out because of rpm's dependency hell
