 My bluetooth device was recognized in with the 10.10 live CD, yet after installing, it's not recognized.  Not even sure what it is in the lspci output..

 hcitool dev is empty
 Buddhacz: what's my best bet, re-run the live CD, grab the output from there and come back here?
 Buddhacz: don't honestly know.  brand new laptop i'm trying to get running
 Buddhacz: lsusb has a few things listed, but nothing jumps out as being bluetooth

 Buddhacz: i'll fire up the liveCD and get the output there.  bbiab
 Buddhacz: and of course, it's going to make a liar out of me as now when i'm running the liveCD, still no BT devices are found.
