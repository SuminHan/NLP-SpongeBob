 guys, I installed Ubuntu 10.10
 err
 11.4
 And it refuses to boot right
 Unity won't work right, that is
 It refuses to start
 zvacet: I tried Ubuntu Classic, not working right either
 zvacet: I tried that, it didn't work either
 zvacet, it's not a fresh install
 I upgraded
 zvacet: I upgraded ubuntu to 11.4, then when I tried to log in the login window just disappeared, then I tried again with ubuntu classic selected
 After that, I tried safe mode
 It worked
 Then, I tried unity again, and it kinda worked. No menu bar though
 zvacet: brb, imma try classic again
 zvacet: okay, classic works now
 that was odd
 yay! the chat's dead
