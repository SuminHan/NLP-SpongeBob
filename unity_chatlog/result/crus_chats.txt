 When i follow the instructions for upgrading from Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04 im told theres no new releases found :?
 I have an ubuntu server and the normal MOTD text started doubling up.. i removed the /etc/motd file.. how do i regenerate it?
 acicula: excellent! which script would that be?
 acicula: thanks, me too! :D
 acicula: cheers!
