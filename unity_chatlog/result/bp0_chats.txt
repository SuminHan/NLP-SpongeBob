 you can't roll back but you can backup your /home folder and reinstall 10.04 or 10.01
 10.10
 KXTwo, don't.
 mrdeb, no.
 mrdeb, many bugs, and slow
 rahduke, are you using the nvidia installer or "additional drivers"?
 amy_, use firefox? there is a firefox extension called flash-aid or something like that, that will get you the best flash support possible
 dont use the packages
 amy_, you might also like caffeine, a little applet thing that disables the screensaver while flash video is playing...  https://launchpad.net/caffeine
 amy_, netinstall is not a very good idea right now, wait a few days maybe... the repos are very slow
 probably better
 amy_, but I upgraded with thumbdrive and it still took an hour... had to fetch 30 packages yet, I guess
 gaceman, update manager will give you a button to press, but you might not want to

 SS_, yes.

 what do I have to do to get the back to normal
 merther... /dev/disk/by-label/
 Lesterwood, everyone needs help... but that is a bug
 one of many
 dont hold your breath
 curse and wave your arms in the air
 Lesterwood, thats a bug in ubuntu software center, there is nothing to do
 Lesterwood, oh you have options? most times I see that windows it is just blank
 Lesterwood, what pacakage?
 Lesterwood, what package or file is it asking about? anyway, use the maintainer's version most likely, unless you remember editing that file yourself
 Lesterwood, no panels or panel applets in unity, they have "indicators" only
 Lesterwood, thats what they're going for
 manOwl, are you sure
 what is the package
 huh interesting
 manOwl, I promise.
 bibinou, apt-get remove overlay-scrollbar liboverlayscrollbar-*
 bibinou, liboverlay-scrollbar- maybe
 .gvfs is where fuse mounts
 s33k, you can't move it while fuse is using it
 you can't move /home while logged in as a normal user
 s33k, you need to log in to "recovery mode" and move /home, you can't do it while a user is logged in
 s33k, safest is recovery mode, you can't let anything be in use in /home
 argon, there is definitely a performance problem with nvidia drivers in 11.04
 yes, upgrading is a mistake

 something is messud up with nvidia and 11.04
 I went back to maverick and my nvidia problem is solved. even though it is the same version of the driver

 uberfrau, thats what you should use
