 i just mount 'ubuntu 11.4' by ISO file on my computer so now how can i upgrade my ubuntu (10.10) to new version?
 there must be some ways to upgrade from iso files?
 you mean burn the ISO on a CD?
 red2kic: no desktop folder in ISO file!
 red2kic:  ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso   >> just download from ubuntu.com!!!!
 red2kic: so what's the diffrent between them?
 red2kic: but i think if i burn that on a CD , i can also install a fresh ubuntu? am i right?
