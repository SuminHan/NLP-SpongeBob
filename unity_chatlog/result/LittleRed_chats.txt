 anyone install Natty to a laptop yet?
 zenocon > did you have any video driver issues?
 zenocon: when I upgraded to 10.11 I had problems with my nvidia card... so I'm a little afraid...
 anyone... is it possible to roll it back to previous version if the install hates me?
 Natty hasn't been out there with the masses that long has it? I know a lot of people have upgraded to it, but I'm guess I'm waiting to see a known issues doc before I try it
 Omega: that's what I was thinking, but loading drivers is a pain... even though I'm getting good at it
 Omega: I have a nvidia cardd and I had to manually upgrade the driver with the last 2 releases
 Omega: someone had filed a bug on it already, so I didn't bother.Never tried LiveCD
 Omega: might try it this weekend. I have other machines I can use to surf to find fixes if needed
 Omega: thanks... only way to learn these things is to have them break  :-)
 Ah there is a kow issue with the nvidia card drivers... have to install a package before the last reboot to resolve it

 bull9408: how did you upgrade it?
 bull9408: did you use LiveCD?
 bull9408: what kind of laptop... no liveCD was what I'm looking for...
 bull9408: I have a 64 bit Sony...
 Bull9408: I have always just upgraed from the update manager, so I was looking for people who used the CD to do the update...
 bull9408: that makes sense with the new hard drive
 bull9408: think I'm going to try my desktop first.... I can't live without my laptop for very long
