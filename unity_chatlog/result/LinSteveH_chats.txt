 ... and yes, I use -t nfs, NOT -t nfs4.
 I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and I am trying to do an nfs mount from  a NAS that cannot do nfs4.  My mount fails, and when I put -vvvvv as a flag, I see that the out put says, "mount.nfs: mount(2): Connection refused
 mount.nfs: trying text-based options 'vers=4,addr=192.168.10.41,clientaddr=192.168.10.80'" before it fails.   How do I get it NOT to use nfs4??

 harrihu: What does the output look like with "iwconfig wlan0"?
 harrihu: it is a comman line.
 harrihu: If you getnoting useful from iwconfig, do a google with "{name of wifi card} +ubuntu +driver +download"
 harrihu: getnoting==get nothing

 I;ve heard that 10* is a little buggy in nfs.  Does anyone concur?
 robert05ad: I have "nfs" not "nfs4" as my mount type.
 top_ramen: Whatcha doing?
 top_ramen: I think that you need to explicitly copy the 0th sector from the cd (cdimage) to the usb.
 top_ramen: I think that you need to do "dd if={cd|cdimage} of={usb location} count=1
 robert05ad: Yes, I did...it still tries to force vers=4 onto the commandline.
 Alterno: does any sound program work, or just banshee is busted?
 top_ramen: Queries??
 {blush} not knowing what it was, I closed the tab.
