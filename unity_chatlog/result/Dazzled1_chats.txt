 Does anyone know of a way to get information about the current system without being sudo?
 HDD Serial, MOBO id
 jaredquinn: something to identify a machine with
 jrib: thanks, it complained I should be sudo, but it showed the info :)
 anyone knows where I could ask a question about the Google Chrome PDF plugin (I'm using Ubuntu)
 dang it, not enough space left for NN :(
 does anyone knows how I can find out what I can/cannot move from my local "File System" ?
 as the Updater complains about a lack of space, but I have swaths available on my other partitions
 (NTFS, though)
 hmm, I'm under the impression that Natty boots significantly slower then 10.10
 also when shutting down, seems to take afes
 LetsGo67: using TwinView or Seperate X?
 coz_: laptop, 10.10 was lightning fast
 coz_: true
 my login screen shows fine on dual monitors, but when  I enter my name and pass, the left screen seems to have trouble to render
 but when I click something/touch a key, the anomaly dissappears
 coz_: ah ok, yeah I'm on Natty
 coz_: yeah, I'm still trying to get used to it :)
 coz_: ah, I see
 coz_: yeah, think I might consider switching back as well
 coz_: ah, yeah, that's what I meant :p
 maxagaz: PrntScrn works fine here
 the only feeling I have about Unity atm is that it's form over function
