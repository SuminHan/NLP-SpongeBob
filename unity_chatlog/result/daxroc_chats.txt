 Morning all
 After upgrading to 11.04, Having lots of problems with the desktop. and nvidia twinview is not working at all
 The desktop has no compiz enabled so theres no side or top bar anymore ? How do I restart them ?
 Soothsayer: yeah dual head
 BlouBlou: Both
 Soothsayer: Quadro NVS 295
 KNUBBIG: youll need to enable a switcher in compiz config found under settings
 Soothsayer: twinview is nvidias version of xinerama
 Soothsayer: its the piece of functionality that gives you dual(or more) monitor support, one big desktop
 Soothsayer: did you get it sorted after ?
 Soothsayer: Dual monitors
 Soothsayer: how did you get it working ?
 Having problems with an nvidia quadro nns 295, only one monitor is being detected , Has any one seen this ?
  *nns -> nvs
 Any one here using an nvidia quadro (nvs 295) or like with a dual monitor setup on 11.04 ?
 I'm not impresed with natty, It's very primitive for a mainstream release
 gartral: Lots of things are missing. decent monitor detection, simple customisation for little anoyances of unity. don't get me wrong it's great but lacks a complete feature set I expected
 gartral: It's more than a driver problem, and shipping with experimental drivers. Is that a good situation to start in (nouvaeu). As for faster on a core i7 here and performance is a little slow. If I wanted more I would custom comple tho , I'll take ease of maintenence for one box over speed :)
 Is unity not a bastadisation of gnome3 ?
 Psychobudgie: very gnome shell like tho
 Psychobudgie: my bad , been a while from when I tested last
 I'm having problems with nvidia driver, conf http://pastebin.ca/2053509 and xorg errors and warnings http://pastebin.ca/2053510 . The problem I have is that one of two monitors connected has a resoulution of 640x480 and other is fine, I've tried different metamodes. has any one a possible solution or advice.
 ryankirkman: there is none by default , but it should be put in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 ryankirkman: not really as it depends on your graphic card(s),
 ryankirkman: not really
