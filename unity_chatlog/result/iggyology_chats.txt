 is clicking on Firfox... watching the icon pulse... and .... nothing happens (acer aspire one, win 7 starter garbage, Ubuntu on 4 gig flash, everything loaded ok, got internet access)
 brb in 1 minute... I would like to PM anyone about my firefox issue in Ubuntu on my flash drive
 this room is flying!
 etcetera
 latin for "and so on"
 ha hahahhahaha
 sorry
 lol
 have to leave my chair for 1 minute
 brb
 is now sitting at his computer, asking for help with Ubuntu on a flash drive... trying to get Firefox to actually open and not just blink
 does anyone know why the Firefox icon would pulse, but Firefox wouldn't open? I'm using ubuntu on a flash drive
 Dr. Willis: Thanks, but can you help me understand what a terminal is?
 is it like a dos window?
 @Dr Willis : thank you... doing that now
 I'm in a terminal window, can anyone tell me the command line to start Firefox this way.. and I'll look for errors.
 lol...
 So I'm surprised...
 firefox opened just fine this way!!!!!
 weird
 I just typed "firefox" in the terminal window and it opened just fine. For some reason the icon on the apps bar won't open Firefox correctly.
 I wonder if I have to install something to make the Firefox icon work properly... I would hate to open a terminal window every time I want to open Firefox!
 I would very much like to PM with someone who can help me with my new flash loaded Ubuntu.
 This room is very busy.
 I think it's good that people are getting into Linux.
 Would anyone like to help me with my flash installed ubuntu?
 is talking with Jenk
 is messaging Jenk
 yes, a thumb drive... I'm messaging you back in pm
 pm'ed Dr. Willis
 would like to continue to pm Jenk
 I'm looking for help with Ubuntu I loaded onto a flash memory drive
 ok
 I loaded Firefox on ubuntu... I click on the icon and it just pulses.. but doesn't open.. so I...
 opened a terminal window, typed "firefox" and..
 it opened just fine..
 I'm perplexed
 In short: 1-loaded ubuntu on flash drive, 2-reloaded Firefox to try and fix issue of Firefox not opening 3-still wouldn't open, 4-opened a terminal window typed "firefox" and it opened. I'm looking to pm someone who thinks they know what is wrong.
 I want to learn ubuntu so I can start helping other noobs.
 I loaded using the flash installer file that was recommended on ubuntu's website
 I did in fact drag a new icon into the bar, but that didn't work either
 is pming Jenk right now..
 is still working with "Jenk" on my flash drive ubuntu issues
 Can an experienced person help me with my flash loaded ubuntu. So far I'm pm'ing Jenk, but we seem to be stalled.
 Can someone help me with my flash installed ubuntu?
 is pming html_inprogress
 Is there anyone who is very knowledgeable in debugging icons that won't open the app?
 I'm running into icon's that won't open the app
 @LAcan : can you pm me?
 ok
 how do I configure the change from sudo to gksudo?
 is that something in the system or the icon properties maybe?
 I'm editing the shortcut...... thanks LAcan. I'll see if this works
 How do I get into the properties for an icon?
 anyone able to tell me how to edit an icon to use gksudo instead of sudo?
 Sorry if someone responded to me, but I didn't see it, I'm trying to change the way an icon initiates the opening of it's respective app by switching it from sudo to gksudo. Whatever that means
 @LAcan : can you tell me where to look for sudo?
 I don't know how to get to the launcher properties.
 LAcan, when I right click the only menu options are 1-open a new window, 2-Firefox web browser, and 3 -keep in launcher
 if I say "launcher" I mean the icon in the bar on the left side of the screen
 perhaps I need to understand what launcher means?
 lacan, i downloaded ubuntu from canonicals website... it loaded with a pretty app icon bar on the left side of the screen
 ubuntu stopped the netbook distro
 they merged everything into one ubuntu
 there is no more netbook ubuntu distro
 lol
 cool lacan. I'll try that now
 awww.... man! There was an error while copying saying that the specified location isn't supported!
 can someone tell me how to dig up the properties of an icon?
 @gedO : sorry I'm a noob or I'd help you.
 I'm trying to find someone who knows the way to open an icon's properties
 anyone good at fixing broken icons?
 jdahm? what?
 jdahm: I'll try that.... again :)
 some please tell me how to access icon properties
 can someone pm me and tell me how to access icon properties
 I'm trying to get an icon to open the app it's associated with
 souperman, yes
 the launcher icon
 left click?
 Souperman, there is no menu item for properties when i right click on the launcher icon
 LAcan, can you tell me where the icon properties are again?
 Souperman, I don't know what unity is
 should I get rid of it?
 Souperman, oh heck... I'm reading an article right now about it!!!   Man, I had no idea I was using something that hadn't been debugged yet!
 Souperman, here's the article: http://mybroadband.co.za/news/columns/20018-Ubuntu-Unity-not-all-that-unifying.html
 Souperman, I'm in IRC through unity's website the room is #ayatana
 join/ #ayatana
 join /#ayatana
 Souperman, what's xubuntu like? will it run good on a netbook?
 Does anyone use Gnome desktop?
 or is everyone a XFCE fan?
 eternicode, you tell me what you like
 talk to me man!
 So, eternicode, please help me to understand if your approach is superior to a fancy desktop
 or if you're just settled in a comfort zone
 eternicode, So do you know if there is a desktop environment, say that your friends use and are happy with? Something tried and true?
 I see
 lighter is good for a netbook
 eternicode, So Gnome has been around for a while, but maybe the problem is the new "unity" thing?
 also, do you know about XFCE?
 I see why people fall into the poisoning embrace of Windows
 This is nuts
 It's so much work to fart around with Linux
 I've spent 2 days fudging with this stuff
 exactly eternicode!!!
 I have a life I want to get back to!
 lol
 oh my freakin god!
 I mean it's fun talking with people.. I understand why there are Linux groups :)
 my launcher icon is broken. I can only open Firefox directly with the command window (Alt+F2)
 ActionParsnip,
 ActionParsnip, I tried, but I can't place icons on the desktop
 it's not a valid location
 ActionParsnip, nope, not yet, thinking about it though
 it may be lighter too
 Dr_Willis, I'll have to try that after I'm done with Unity's support person
 thanks though
 ActionParsnip, yeah, seems like unity is too "wet behind the ears" still...
 does pasting my .xsession-errors expose my confidential information?
 just wondering
 mang), were you talking to me?
 anyone experienced with natty?
 can you tell me why the Firefox icon isn't showing in the launchbar when there's an open window?
 ActionParsnip, yes I am
 ActionParsnip, can you tell me how to get the icons back in the launch bar?
 ActionParsnip, I wish there was a way for me to get the Unity to work
 but if you think that it's too new than I'll switch
 How many people here have tried Unity and not liked it?
 tsimpson, can you tell me how to get the Firefox icon to show up in the launch bar?
 tsimpson, what do you use for Linux OS?
 tsimpson, have you used anything else?
 tsimpson, this channel is about ubuntu, see I understand that, what I'm trying to do is learn whether learning about ubuntu is a waste of my time, why are you here if you use Kubuntu?
 tsimpson, ok, I'm using ubuntu, it's not working, does that satisfy you?
 can someone help me make ubuntu work?
 I'm using the new Natty with Unity and the launch bar is bugged. It should be put back in the beta room.
 Ubuntu people must be too worried about their competition to admit that they have realeased something prematurely.
 By Ubuntu people I mean Canonical people
 ThinkT510, see your the second person pushing XFCE. I'm thinking that it's currently the best desktop environment. I've also had a couple people suggest that I just go gnome classic with Compz or something like that
 jrib, can you help me fix my icons to work?
 jrib, than go kiss a cobra
 Can someone help me switch to Gnome classic from Unity on Ubuntu Natty?
 Where do I log off?
 I see lock screen, Switch from ubuntu, suspend, restart, shut down, system settings
 ActionParsnip, I don't see log off in the upper right corner.
 ActionParsnip, What is restart x?
 ActionParsnip, c-a-d doesn't have a log off option
 ActionParsnip, When I push Ctrl+Alt+Bkspc nothing happens.
 ActionParsnip, how do I enable the keyboard command Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to show the log off option?
 ActionParsnips, I found it in "Keyboard Shortcuts"
 it allows you press the keys you wish to use to modify the shortcut also, very cool
 ActionParsnip, yes, that was the option I was looking for
