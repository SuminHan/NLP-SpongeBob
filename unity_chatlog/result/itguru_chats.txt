 Does Gwibber crap out for anyone after a few weeks?
 It's THURSDAY!
 ActionParsnip: True, but *this* thursday is special :)
 ActionParsnip: Well, according to my calender, the position of the sun, and BBC News, I should be re installing all my test machines to 11.04 stable :)
 Dammit! Still 10.10 !
 ActionParsnip: I'm just screwing around, I was kinda hoping that this time it woulda happened at midnight, but hey
 no worries, been running beta for weeks
 !?
 wtracy1: hehe! nice! But sleep is for wimps - i'm gonna have all my desktop users asking me where is the awesome new interface that I've been rubbing in their faces on my dell tablet for weeks

 Can anyone recommend a good offline blog editor to use in? I'm trying to go Ubuntu exclusively for my social media needs :)
