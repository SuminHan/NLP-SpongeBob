 Ive been trying to install Ubuntu 10.10 off my usb drive, however when I go through the installation process it gets to the point where it asks me for my computer name, password, etc and finishes installing to where it says "Ready when you are" in the progress bar.  When I get to this point, it doesnt allow me to click the "Forward" button =/  I already deleted my crappy windows 7, and now the only way I can use my netbook is t
 through my flash drive
 help
 lol
 Its a netbook, I dont have a cd.
 but yes
 I am using the "try feature" on my usb drive.
 Anyone know why, for some reason, the installation of ubuntu Netbook 10.10 Rmx wont complete for me? I've tried using it from a pen drive and from an external HD, both arent allowing me to complete installation at the same point.
 I cant complete installation from my usb drive :(
