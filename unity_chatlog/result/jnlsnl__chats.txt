 I need to run a bash command from a php script, but the command is not executed.. i suspect because of permission issues
 can anyone help ,me with this? I need to give PHP permission to execute a bash script
 I want to make a service hook from github that executes a git pull command so a test server is in synch with my repository
 hypetech i did 777 on it and nothing :/
 hypetech hmm still not working :(
 hypetech i have a php file with this inside: <?php `git pull`;
 haha will do :)
 hmm i  can make git pull as user "ubuntu" but when i try as root it says: Permission denied (publickey).
 can i give root same ssh keys as an user
 dotblank so if i cp mu ssh keys from user/.ssh to root/.ssh it should work ?
 PHP is run as the "www-data" user right?
 Ok... i need to somehow give "www-data" the same ssh keys as my "ubuntu" user
 hmmt he ubuntu font looks much thinner in a pdf than on openoffice =(
