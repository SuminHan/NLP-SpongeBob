 hey guys, I'm trying to install a gedit plugin, and since I didn't have a ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins path, I made it in terminal, but it doesn't show up in Dolphin. What can I do? (Kubuntu 10.10 user btw)
 pksadiq, I don't think I created the directory with a . in it, and when I enabled 'show hidden files' it didn't pop up. Maybe I created the directory incorrectly in Konsole? There is documentation by the plugin writer if that would help? ;o
 pksadiq, what? o.O
 okay, i figured out wtf i did wrong
 how do i find ~/.local/share in Dolphin?
 GUI makes it easier >_>
 dustin_ i do :/
 ja
 pksadiq, i'll try that, and then i can go back to see why i can't see it in Dolphin right now =)
 oh it was in Home
 oops, sorry to whoever said that, i misunderstood what you meant by it, i'm a newbie ;d
 was in home o.O
 :S I copy + pasted the contents of the tarball download (the gedit plugin, and yes i extracted it into tmp)into ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins , and restarted gedit, but the plugin isn't available in the list under preferences. What should check/what could I have done incorrectly?
 guize? ;o
 and i just tried `make install` and it failed (Error 1) :/

 is my question too stupid to respond to or something? X_X
 guys... ._.?

 someone please answer my question, or at least say why it isn't a good question =/
 pavucontrol?
 FishFace, do what as root? o.o
 shcherbak: https://github.com/kassoulet/gedit-focus-autosave#readme and i did extract it
 and sorry about the spamming, i've been at this for 1.5 hours and want to get back to Ruby :/
 escott, yes it is correct
 the ubuntu page on gedit says as much
 when i do the make install, it says the files already exist where they should be (Error 1)
 shcherbak, how do i do your recommendation?
 and i was not root when i did the make...i was in the directory which contains the files?
 shcherbak O_O i have never really done this stuff, sorry i'm dunno how to do this stuff...the three files = ?, the readme directory, chown, and chmod are where?
 shcherbak: i did read README before asking this stuff, i'll try to accomplish your fix, thanks
 shcherbak: WOW, i think i mixed up local and share in the path! OMG D:
 Windows experience bites me in the ass again! (local_low is probably what I was thinking)
 stupid thing i discovered in the process of trying to install this gedit plugin:
 when i do `cd ~`, it just takes me to home/user
 i thought ~ was root? :(
 i know i have more files than the contents of `cd ~`
 how do i get to the very top level?
 shcherbak, what? O_O!?
 thanks
 so ~ is home, / is root, k
 now that i know that, back to trying to install the plugin =)
 greenlantern: halt! *German glare* :D
 oh, shcherbak, when exactly will i have to use sudo? did you mean if i'm copying+pasting using Konsole?
 shcherbak: i extracted them and somehow they are located at /tmp/kde-Sophia/
 shcherbak, oh ;s
 are you sure O_O!!?
 shcherbak, i don't get your point
 shcherbak, it's okay, you're trying to help <3
 shcherbak, i just told you where i extracted them to (pretty sure i accidentally clicked on something wrong when choosing the extraction location/files with ark)
 sure, sec
 shcherbak: k, in the directory that i extracted the tarball into now =)
 wait what?
 shcherbak, I'm confused as to what you want me to do now
 shcherbak: yes
 shcherbak, sure, but keep in mind i have to create the path for plugins i think
 shcherbak, ? so you don't want the paste to see the path of gedit? or am i misunderstanding you
 k sec
 shcherbak, go to the directory which contains the tarball? o.o
 oh
 shcherbak: so you meant the location of the extracted files?
 k
 k shcherbak i'm there
 shcherbak, sec
 oh shcherbak, i am already in kassou...
 i typed cd when in the above directory, and just copy+pasted in the name of it lol
 trying, sec
 shcherbak: nothing happened when i did that command, other than asking me for my pw
 shcherbak, i restarted gedit, and the plugin 'focus autosave' is in the list, but it's blacked out
 shcherbak, maybe the path in that command needs to be replaced with the path in the README?
 Gulfstream, do you have codecs n stuff?
 shcherbak, sure =D
 Gulfstream: idk, i've never had issues with any file formats thus far (Kubuntu 10.10 user)
 sure it isn't your hardware?
 Gulfstream: you could try playing the same sort of stuff with a different distro
 and idk about lense cleaning, so I can't advise you on that
 oh, then that is a strong indication that it is hardware
 try to see if there is any sort of pattern to the disruption to the video, and see if it matches commonly reported symptoms of issues online. That's all i can say really, i'm no expert, i just read a lot of random information.
 shcherbak, plugin didn't load, what do you mean? :o and idk about using vim yet, while I'm still learning to program :/
 shcherbak, oh...this plugin was featured in a link from the official ubuntu site, under the entry for gedit :(
 shcherbak, this plugin isn't critical, it was more about the process of learning how to install plugins, which i sort of know how to do now (though i haven't created the requisite directory yet)
 if you could find another plugin that does the same thing, i would love it, however
 and should i look into vim? ;o
 shcherbak, well it shouldn't be featured on that site then D:
 and the reason i'm not using a fully featured environment is that i want to learn how to just focus on the code with a plain text-editor first...
 shcherbak, i have no idea
 i did just spend almost 3 hours trying to do this :(
 at least i learned a couple of things about the file system :/
 shcherbak, thanks for the help anyhoo. I'm using pidgin, and i'm going to leave this open as a tab  in case i have any questions =)
 hey guys, flash is giving me problems (little or large squares over view window or buttons), what can i do about it?
 yes Axlin
 so i should just go get t his 'flash-aid'? is it ff4 compatible? :/
 k, going to try that then, Axlin, brb =)
 update your graphics card drivers, Charbel :D
 blueonyx, are hidden files shown by any chance?
 err, Axlin, idk how to look at add-ons with ff4 :/
 nvm, found it
 is now a subsection of a search, lame
 Axlin: i ran the script after downloading it, and it doesn't seem to have solved my problem. You stated that there is a "npviewer tweak for 64b system with 32b plugin" option, but i do not see it...
 oh i see it now, sorry for overlooking it. what does it do though?
 . = hidden, just making sure you knew that
 =)
 blueonyx, idk about your specific issue, sorry buddy :o
 Axlin, disabling that setting fixed it, thank you very much for pointing me to that add-on
 wait Axlin
 now no sound...
 wtf lol
 err Axlin, i disabled that plugin but youtube still doesn't work...what do
 video runs, audio doesn't
 i just want flash to work, it's too important x.x
 my computer is 64, and i'm pretty sure i installed 64 as well
 Axlin, is okay as long as i get sound back -_-
 celthunder: i have no idea how to do that ._.
 bp0, that's what i installed, it killed my sound
 yes
 youtube :/
 bp0:    Shockwave Flash 10.3 d162
 faryshta: it disabled my headphones...
 god damn it -_-
 how the hell did installing flash-aid disable my headphones???!?
 oh? where then? it resulted *from* running the flash-aid script ;/
 idk how to restart pulse :/
 oh wait
 i think i fixed it
 went into pavucontrol and toggled on headphones
 why did it toggle it off to begin with, though? :(
 thanks for the help, fixed my problem
 though i dislike solving one problem and then having to solve another to have the same functionality as before
