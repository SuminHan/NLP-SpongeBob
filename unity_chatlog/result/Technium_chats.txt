 I have a problem with my new 11.04 install. The LiveCD booted into Unity with acceleration but now I've installed it I found myself in the old experience. How can I switch to Unity?
 It current Says Ubuntu, not classic :(
 Its a new Dell Latitude 6520 with Intel and Nvidia. The additional drivers say installed but not active.
 Only to remove. The phrase is "activated but not currently in use"
 Yes
 "nvidia              10709116  0 "
 "VALIDATION ERROR: Data incomplete in file /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
 "Device section "Default Device" must have a Driver line."
 :)
 Okay, thats is cleaner. Reboot?
 Thanks. BRB
 After enabling the nvidia driver it booted to a black screen. I'm back on the intel driver. Confused how it worked fine on the LiveCD?
 Yes, the new Dell Latitude 6520
 Yes... but the LiveCD worked :)
 Yup
 Sure, could you tell me how/what you need?
 Okay BRB
 Right I've booted into the LiveCD and have Unity
 That immediately solved the issue - its the i965 driver :) Didnt realise that was accelerated enough to run unity
 Sorry lost networking for a sec. xdriinfo output is "Screen 0: i965"
 Okay. Why isn't the i965 being configured by default when I install?
 Thanks for the link. I'm happy sticking with the i965, but I'm confused why that wasn't selected once I installed as it was when I booted the LiveCD.
 Dell Latitude 6520, new i7
 Sorry, E6520
 I think I need to enable the i965 drivers to enable Unity on this laptop can't figure out how
 No, there's both in here and the LiveCD works with Unity using the i965 driver
 Its a laptop so not sure exactly

 bazhang: thanks, i'll look into that
 bazhang, id be happy sticking with the intel driver as that seemed to work fine on the LiveCD and I don't tend to need 3d... is that easier?
 bazhang - I had Unity working on LiveCD without doing anything - it used the i965
 bazhang - I'd like to get that working now I've installed
