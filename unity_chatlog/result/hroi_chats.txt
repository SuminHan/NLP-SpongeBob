 hello
 anybody know how I can get the good old normal gnome desktop,
 I have this funny notebook one
 cb-linux:   I dont have any lista desktop choice on my login screen
 cb-linux:  you just saved my life, and earned me an hour sleep, thanks!
 cb-linux:   ahh but unfortunately this did not fix my problem with starting ooffice applications ...
 all my soffice applications hang on oosplash.bin  ... and nothing happens
 how do I find out if my ubuntu has Java JRE ?
 taglass:   java jre for the open office
 taglass: ok I have java 1.6
