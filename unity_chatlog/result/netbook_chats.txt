 hey everyone! I have a microphone issue.
 anyone have time to help me stop my mic output.  Its driving me crazy!
 yes, even muting does not solve it
 i will attempt... just install alsamixer?
 I am installing it now.  Will it automagically be configured, or do I have to switch to it?
 in the software center it was called "gnome alsa mixer"
 alsa fixed it! thanks!
