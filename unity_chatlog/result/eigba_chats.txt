 How do you guys like unity? I know I will have to try it myself, just wanting to get opinions
 Of course not I like to try out new things just wanted opinions
 who the hell said I want to be told what to think
 I honestly love gnome 3, but its always fun to try out new things
 Of course I have many boxes to try it on, just wanted to see what people here thought. From most reviews ive read people hate it. again trying it out is not the problem for me.
 jdahm, Arch users here too
 I think I like unity, how is everyone else taking it?
 erik333, I take it your not liking unity?
 asteriskmonkey1, I wish they would of went with gnome3
 Hello all
 How is everyone liking unity? I like the overal layout however it's going to take a lot of modifying for me
 I perfoer gnome 3 for sure
 Im defantly having fun tinkering with it, Not sure if its something im gonna keep though
 I wonder if they plan on putting gnome 3 in the repos? probably not?
 I think people comming from mac will enjoy 11.04 lol
 Nothing wrong with a new desktop enviroment comming out, however they should put gnome 3 on the repo also
 Maybe there will be a new forked named Gubuntu? with gnome? lol
 fork*
 Im comming from Arch linux, this channel moves fast lol
 arkanabar, I just use the mouse software that always came with ubuntu/gnome its still there and works
 Choosing ubuntu classic from the GDM login is the old gnome 2 correct?
 I think unity is a nice for new people comming form mac/windows, however im not a fan
