 Has everyone upgraded? How is the new OS?
 kowen, That sounds like you don't like it...
 kowen, Really...? Hmmm....
 kowen, I am correct in saying compiz isn't compatible right...?

 AHhh okay.
 kowen,  I may go back to 10.04 still... I think I will wait to see the long term effects on the OS.
 Then again I may switch distro's...
 Lol.
 Arphetic, emense should have it by default...
