 i hope i'm wrong but to me it seems that natty ships with a stone-age lirc (0.8.7) that is NOT compatible with nattys lirc kernel drivers?
 !lirc
 is it really so that natty ships with a stone-age lirc (0.8.7) that is NOT compatible with nattys lirc kernel drivers?

 Blue1: that can be done with just "cd"
 ror: too much trying to mimick mac-style ... this release definitely seems to be at testing stage
 dijonyummy: you can choose at login screen
 RXShorty: i have the same on 10.04 desktop, says there are upgrades on login when there really aren't any
 RXShorty: it appeared sometime 1-2 weeks ago, now they are stuck there even though upgrades come and go
 RXShorty: actually seems it somehow is duplicated now: http://pastebin.com/FZQ1NVrA
 novice: they should be listed when you click on the network icon
 novice: iwlist scan or something like that on the command line at least
 zvacet: nope, the 23 packages to be updated message is not related to maverick imho
 that is an old message that has been sticking there for a while
 zvacet: 1 package got upgraded and after that the 23/18 package message still sticks
 gare: no there isn't, it's the same as normal ubuntu
 mbeierl: at least used to work in maverick, so one would suppose yes..
 mbeierl: ok sorry, i've only used through bluetooth
 does anyone know why natty's gdm does not remember the last logged in user? i just get "other" every time and have to press enter and type my username manually whereas in maverick it would prompt for the password right away
