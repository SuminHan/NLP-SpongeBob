 I want to move back to 10.10
 aah
 shit
 sorry
 ooh k
 also I find too much of processes in idle state
 lots of CPU utilization
 I moved back to ubuntu classic
 :)
 I'm using i7 processor
 I kinda feel huge CPU utilization
 @pumeust \m/
 @pumeust, don't you find 11.04 bit slow, and CPU hog..
 on i7 processor I find lots of CPU hog for 11.04
 I think I should get back to 10.10
 pumeust, yes.. but I guess not well tested on my hw.. it's just few hrs old.. would take some time to evolve :D
 I did a foolish thing.. I installed linux kernel of server on desktop.. and now I don't even get the login screen
 any suggesions, to start using the old kernel
 zvacet, I'm unable to get synapic
 I would like to remove the newer installed kernel.. and start using the previous kernel
 it was an upgrade.. everything on 11.04 was working fine.. to my mischief.. I installed kernel 2.6.38 server edition.. and now I don't even see the login screen !zvacet
 solved by modifyting the grub.cfg
