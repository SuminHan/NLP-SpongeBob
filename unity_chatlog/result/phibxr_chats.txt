 you still aren't able to install the official google-chrome deb by double clicking it and letting it run in software center? that issue was reported weeks ago. :/
 Rehan, when I click "Install" after a clean install, it works for a second and goes back to the product description screen with the "Install" button. facing the same issue on two laptops and one netbook. :S
 Rehan, using gdebi works just fine though.
 Rehan, the package that was used before software center was associated by .deb's. :)
 Why did #ubuntu+1 become invite only?
 acnot, ohsix, guntbert, ah, thanks. :)
 ohsix, sounds like he's running ubuntu-classic.
 FunnyLookinHat, I agree that it's a bit silly that you need external packages to configure the behavior of the default GUI. I still like Unity though. :P
 when you get a blue arrow in the upper left corner, how can you identify the window demanding attention?
 swatto, use the torrent, gave me 1MB/s. :)
 swatto, oh, you're upgrading. nevermind then. no idea. :)
 swatto, i usually keep my /home partition intact and perform clean installs instead. :)
 is it possible to configure unity/compiz to darken the rest of the desktop while asking for root access?
 Can you disable the reddish Ubuntu One-bar in Nautilus in your Documents-folder etc?
 akashm1990, i've never had any trouble with grub not recognizing an installed operating system.
 Has anyone been able to change the mouse pointer in the Appearance-pane? No matter what I select, it stays as the default pointer.
 when I make a custom launcher entry in alacarte and give it an icon, why does it show up as a ?-mark in the launcher while the icon is visible in the dash?
 dupondje, sounds like the booting screen, plymouth i think, not displaying properly. got an nvidia-card?
 sebastian, did you install compizconfig-settings-manager?
 linux, you have a /time-command here. ;)
 DJRoby4, you should probably ask on the elementary forums/channels instead.
 DJRoby4, oh, I see. I thought you upgraded. :)
 Laggg, log out and select... nevermind. ubottu knows everything. :P
 haseeb, try apt-get install minitube
 coun, why don't you use the binary drivers?
 coun, the nvidia closed-source binary drivers. actually, they installed on first boot for me.
 Gremlyn1, under screen settings you should be able to drag your primary monitor to the left, or select it.
 Gremlyn1, <super>, monitor
 coun, I got the closed-source ones by default. the proprietary that is.
 coun, can you run nvidia-settings?
 coun, if you can, you're running the closed-source binary drivers.
 coun, after a couple of beers, I actually can't remember your issue anymore. so let's hope someone else can help you. :)
 coun, ah, yes, right. why don't you use the proprietary drivers? the noveau drivers aren't that good yet.
 coun, press <super> (Windows-key) and type driver, press enter. should present you with Additional drivers, where you can activate the proprietary drivers.
 coun, that's one strange bug. what card are you using?
 coun, i'm using some obsure intel/nvidia integrated card in my laptop, so most cards should work as well or better. :P
 coun, have you tried "sudo apt-get install nvidia-current"?
 coun, installs the latest proprietary nvidia-drivers for your card.
 coun, yep. but you never know.
 coun, you're most welcome.
 coun, no idea if it has been added to the ubuntu repositories yet. i use gmail through the browser. :)
 coun, I've stopped worrying about google, since I've already disclosed anything useful you could ever know about me to them. but I think that discussion is more appropriate for #ubuntu-offtopic, before someone redirects it there. :P
 billsmith, running at update should put you at the current release.
 billsmith, *an
 Master, of course, most people in here would respond 'ubuntu'. :)
 Master, it's like joining #apple and asking what the best personal computer is. :P
