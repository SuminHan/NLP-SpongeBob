 Would anyone be kind enough to provide the md5sum hash for the released i386 desktop 11.04 or a link to same? TIA
 !natty
 As above...
 I have searched and searched...Could any supply me with the hash (md5sum) for: Natty, 11.04 i386 desktop.iso I have been seeding it for 2:47 and the hashs don't agree.
 Incarus6, +3
 Thanx AP
 ActionParsnip, I checked the link you graciously gave...It hasn't been updated. :-( No hash for Natty

 UserX7, I'm a firm believer in the old adage, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
 UserX7, Not sure exactly how to do that if it's not found under Hardware Drivers.

 Rehan: Try: System--> Hardware Drivers
 Rehan: Ah, OK I'm using Lucid; I usually answer in that vein. Sorry I can't be of more help.
 Rehab: That's why I like LTS; I don't like having to relearn a 'new' system every six months...
 Rehan: But that's just me.
 Rehan: Welks
 Nah, vamp., it's workin' fine.
 Rehan: Not sure how; it shows up in mine, in the left portion of the screen after I click home'
 Rehan: I'm sure there's a way to do want you want, but after a quick check, I'll be darned if I can see where. :-(
 Rehan: Why do you need to access the File System so often?
 Rehan: OK, I have looked around quite extensively, in file system, but I don't need to that often.
 But you can reinstall 10.10
 Beat me.

 bruzer: Can you get the wireless router any closer to your ;puter? Or perhaps the other way around?
 bruzer: That's a stumper. Did you try rebooting the router?
 ask > santhu1984
 santhu1984, Can you boot to live CD and look around from there?
 santhu1984, What about booting to Recovery Mode
 santhu1984, Well, as I'm sure you're aware, if all else fails, you may need to clean install.. :-(
 santhu1984, You can always reinstall the older version, but you'll loose all of your data; unless you had/have a separate home directory.
 santhu1984, On a separate partition.
 santhu1984, You need to aquire a Live CD, boot to it then save your data to an external drive or another partition.
 santhu1984, I know absolutely nothing about itunes; I wouldn't touch it, sorry. :-)
 tyler87, I believe there is. Chech this out...
 !partitioning > tyler87
 tyler87, Then just use a partitioning tool (gparted, perhaps) to combine the two.
 tyler87, Back up everything FIRST!
 tyler87, Like I said, I think you should be able to do that with extended/logical partitions; just back up...
 tyler87, You're more than welcome.
 lavanyadeepak, I believe that you'll have to update version by version to go from 10.04 to 11.04.
 terry: X-Chat
 terry: it's under Applications-->Internet

 terry: some folks use irissi but you have to install it
 Antilect, You could always try #ubuntu-offtopic
 Eduard, How 'bout Clonezilla?
 Sorry,Ed, that was for deshymers...
 deshymers, OK
 glda19, I had that happen once. The battery was dead in a computer that sat unplugged for weeks and the current date was, like, 8 years ago...
 glda19, Reset the date and all was A-OK; Not saying that that's your problem, but...
 glda19, Please see above two ^^

 RichardJ, With all due respect to the developers, many aspects of Wubi can be problematic. Please keep in mind that one of it's purposes is to simply try Ubuntu, from the windows environment. If one likes the next logical step is to install Ubuntu; dual-boot, and go from there.
 coz_: regarding the root pswd thing, what about Slackware?
 coz_:Naw, I understand; I was just wondering...

 ozanorhan, You may remove them if you want; if you want them back, simply reinstall.

 Hey U_C
 naveed, Perhaps because answers come faster than the forums.

 truepurple, One could, but if one did, how would the system know which one to boot to?
 truepurple, It was an answer to your question. ;-)
 truepurple, The answer os no.

 truepurple, Brasero isn't bad.
 truepurple,  Yes, although sometimes it gives me multiple error messages that "it couldn't" but in spite of the messages it does...Go figure.
 10.04 and 10.10 use Gnome.
 syockit, An I correct in my assumption (I'm on 10.04) that one can get to Gnome in 11.04 at boot by selection "Classic Ununtu?"
 syockit, Thanx
 Off topic..
