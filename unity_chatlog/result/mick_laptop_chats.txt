 anyone know how to tell casper to start an app on start?
 i tried a few things like an entry in .xsessionrc in /etc/skel
 so far nothing :(
 MaRk-I: i'm working on a remixed cd
 so i'm dealing w/ casper directly
 what does "source" do? (no manpage), I know it doesn't execute a file... but something like that?
 hi, does anyone know why I can't autologin? I have it set to login w/o a password under my username, and under login preferences - there is a checkbox "automatically login as..." but my user isn't in the dropdown and it is grayed out. any ideas?

 hi everyone, I installed ubuntu on an Acer laptop and everything was going just fine (for a few days) - now it is acting funny (started w/ X not really working like it should etc.). Now i get "No init found" and a busybox prompt
 when i try to reinstall (w/ a cd or usb) I can't get passed that prompt
 i took out the hdd - truying again
