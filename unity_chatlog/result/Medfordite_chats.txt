 Hey all - Great work!  Can anyone tell me if/when broadcom support for the Compaq V5000 (Broadcom B43 I believe) will be ready?

 Celthunder - Not seeing the Restricted drivers listing the driver like usual as in 10.10 or 10.04.
 Hmmm...another issue, attempting install of grub boot loader now at the moment for the Server version and it is erroring out with the update-grub function.  2 hard drives, installing to the master drive.
