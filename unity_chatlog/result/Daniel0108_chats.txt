 hi
 I have a problem, I can't connect to another IRC network with my client. Only freenode works. If I connect over webchat, it also works. I think there's a firewall running, but I don't know which firewall is still running, I disabled firestarter :/
 coz_: xchat and irssi :P
 BlouBlou: I can connect to the server, but I get no response from it, I'm online, but I don't get server responses, it's a one-way connection
 Dr_Willis: No, iptables accepts all connections
 Dr_Willis: hmm.. so it's a router firewall? but it worked a few days ago... btw, the last message I get from the server is: "* *** Looking up your hostname..."
 Dr_Willis: It's definitely my firewall, I tried it on my desktop and it worked
 Dr_Willis: are there other firewalls, I don't think iptables is the only firewall I have :P
 Dr_Willis: yes I know, but I installed ufw, and then I removed it because it blocked the connections :/
 Dr_Willis: yes, there were rules, but I flushed them
 Dr_Willis: I flushed my iptables config and it's still blocking the connection, I don't know WHAT is blocking my connection. I messed up my firewall config :/
 Dr_Willis: It worked before I set up firewall stuff yesterday
 Dr_Willis: are there any logs where I can see what is blocking the connection?
 I have to reinstall my ubuntu, because I messed up my firewall config, even when I flush iptables it's still blocking connections :/ Which version should I install? 10.04, 10.10 or 11.04?
 I'm running 10.10 now, btw :P
