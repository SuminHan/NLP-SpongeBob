 why does ubuntu 11.04 menu controls disappear when i simply run "emerald --replace"?
 i'm doing exactly what i did with 10.04 and with 11.04 the menu controls/title/etc just go away, why?
 is 11.04 ubuntu desktop too "new" for emerald themes/manager to work with it?
 bazhang, is there an alternative?
 why is it that it seems every "upgrade" is usually a downgrade in features with ubuntu?
 less features, less customability, less etc etc etc
