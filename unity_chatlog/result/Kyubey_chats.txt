 Hey, I have a question about setting up compiz
 Which mouse button is the scrollwheel click?
 I want to know so I can make it the shortcut to scaling\
 yeah, middle click
 tanath, I know how to click it -_-
 I dont know which button compiz sees it as
 for the purpose of using it as a shortcutg
 I'm asking which number the button is for compiz shortcuts
 such as one, two, three, etc. :P
 I want to know so I dont accidentally undo the shortcuts for the right mouse button while trying to get this to work
 Is it two or three? I dont want to mess up the right mouse button's configurations
 haha, tanath, that's the problem
 I dont know if it's two or three
 and I dont want to screw up the settings for the right click doing this
 when I go to change either, it tells me other parts of compiz will be changed
 fuck it, I'm trying 3
 err, sorry, darn it, I shouldn'
 shouldn't swear here
 neither works
 I just tried both
 ohhh
 I have to hold it
 durr -_-
 yeah, just figured that out
 Now I have to figure out why graphical stuff is lagging
 is anyone else having lag problems?
 I'm running 64bit with nvidia graphics drivers
 the beta didnt lag like this at all
 Heya
 So yeah
 I just noticed sound isnt working on my laptop under natty
 But I checked, and it appears natty uses palseaudio now
 I have a wierd sound card, I think only ALSA works on it
 Does anyone know how to fix it?
 I cant do that ohsix
 when I go to sound preferences, it says "Waiting for the sound system to respond"
 no
 I'm using the standard unity ubuntu
 ActionParsnip http://paste.ubuntu.com/600961/
 wait, it cut off a line
 Flash player is interfering with pulse?
 How do I fix this?
 So I cant get sound while using flash? o.o

 ActionParsnip, http://paste.ubuntu.com/600966/
 ActionParsnip Error: need a repository as argument
 ActionParsnip, done
 ActionParsnip, installed
 now what?
 Why?
 I need sound :(
 Actionparsnip, flash is playing fine
 Actionparsnip, now, what about my sound?
 Actionparsnip, no, I said that I cant adjust my volume/unmute and when I try to go into sound preferences it tells me it's waiting for the sound system to respond
 ActionParsnip, you have any ideas?
 let's start again, I guess
 Everyone, I'm having trouble getting sound to work in natty. I cant adjust the volume or unmute it, and if I click sound preferences, it tells me "Waiting for sound system to respond"
 ohsix - the part where you were fixing flash and not my sound at all
 ohsix - I dont have flash running right now
 It's still not letting me adjust the sound
 ohsix http://paste.ubuntu.com/600976/
 ohsix, now when I type that command it doesnt display anything
 ohsix - how do I do that? Do you mean the sound preferences? (I cant open that)
 ohsix, http://paste.ubuntu.com/600978/
 ...what
 How do I not own my home directory?
 oh, woops
 Okay
 I typed sudo as an automatic thing
 ohsix, I ran the same command as normal, it said it "Failed to kil daemon: No such file or directory"
 ohsix, huh?
 ohsix, it said it failed to kill the daemon because there's no such file or directory
 ohsix, yeah, but it's saying there's no such file or directory
 ohsix, when it tries to kill it
 lots of text
 and it doesnt appear to be done
 ohsix, it stopped, it's not done yet, but new text isnt printing anymore
 ohsix (but I dont have a new prompt
 oh!
 it worked!
 ohsix - now it says "waiting fo the sound system to respond"
 ohsix, doesnt print anything
 ohsix, no
 ohsix - I installed this last night, all I've done is install xchat and set a few compiz shortcuts
 I'm gonna try restarting
 Haha
 ohsix
 ohsix, guess what? Restarting fixed it XD
 ohsix, I think it might be because I was hibernating
 ohsix - anyways, it's working now
 Thanks for your help :)
