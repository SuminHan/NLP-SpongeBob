 Hey folks.
 I'm having trouble grasping exactly what stuff is put in /usr/lib and what is put in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -- and why. -- Can someone point me to a possible explanation?
 Hello happy people.
 Since my upgrade to Natty, this laptop of mine suffers ... uh... Not being able to move or switch between Windows. (Rrunning GNOME, I tried to use the other stuff.. What's it called again? But I have no idea how to use that...)
 Atlantic777: the classic way of using it is what's screwed: I cannot *move* windows. I cannot switch between two Windows, which makes it pretty hard when I start a console and a firefox. I'd have to kill off one, to use the other.
 Atlantic777: what's screwed with Unity is that I don't know how to --- good point.
 oh.. great... Alt+F2 doesn't work either..
 w00t. That works. I can switch with the menu bar thingy.
 Please be gentle. I'm GUI-capped.
 I use servers, and trust that my GUI stuff will at least allow me to connect to these.
 So what's a good reason for Windows to not be movable?
 I think I'll first try to rm -rf ~/.gnome* That usually helps. NOt like it's that hard to recreate my config.
 oh joy.. there's a core file... core: ELF 32-bit LSB core file Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), SVR4-style, from 'metacity --replace'
 muuuuch better.
