 ho do you pin windows on top now with unity?
 Dr_Willis: doesn't really work nicely with chrome but ok
 thanks
 is there still something like netbook remix for 11.04, or is it just the regular ubuntu?
 ok, so it is default, will it automatically default to the 2D unity interface? or will it try compiz?
 LjL: ok thanks, I would still prefer the 2D version, want to get most out of it
 which is the gnome 2.X interface
 on a seemingly unrelated note: sometimes unity on my laptop is choppy and I got weird shadow artefacts (binary nvidia driver), however I never get the impression my GPU is being used for Unity, how can I check this?
