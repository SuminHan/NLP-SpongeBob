 I upgraded to 11.04 and now my XOrg starts up with all the icons stretched and the input doesn't work.
 can't clik on anything or use the keyboard in the X
 I can get to a console though
 any one that might have any ideas/
 :/
 yes
 can you assist please ?
 I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 last night
 My XOrg starts up
 but the icons on the screen are stretched and I can't clik on anything
 I can't use the keyboard in x
 it is a dual screen setup
 and it uses the NVidea drivers
 let me get the res quickly
 nope default Unity
 ActionParsnip: I tried that already
 in my xorg.conf : Srceen: Metamode CRT-0 Nvidia-auto-select +0+0, CRT-1: nvidia-auto-select +1280+0
 ActionParsnip: I am trying that now
 vibhav: it looks like it is 1280
 vibhav: will try that next
 vibhav: I have tried the --reset earlier today and that didn't work either
 holy crap text font on boot up is totly screwed, if I try and boot with just one screen in now
 ok, only on one screen now and can still not click on anything or use keyboard shortcuts.
 CTRL + Alt + F1 does work so I can get to a console at least
 vibhav: ok, on one screen teh same thing happens, the icons are just not stretched
 I think ramb0 anad I have a similar probblem
 ramb0: I upgraded and I just get the desktop
 no login
 I can't click on anything and I can't use the keyboardshortcuts
 I do see that if I move my mouse over where the login should be , the edit cursor appreas
 not yet,
 ramb0: have you ?
 lol
 It is my work PC so now I can't work
 ok, this is just stupid, on reboot, I get my desktop being displayed, but I can't click on the icons, When I move the mouse around, on the screen around the middle of the screen the cursor chnages to the edit icon. So the login windows looks like it is there, but ic an't login to it.
 Dr_Willis: and gsp2009 I also have issues, but i am trying it on one screen now and still have issues
 arg, why the hell does the kernel source MakeFile file have the wrong version in?
 it has 2.6.38.2 and the kernel that comes with natty is 2.6.38.8
 I can't recompile the vboxdrivers now
 how can i change back to classic login / gui fromthe command line. I can't see the login screen to select it there
 ok, I have now tried to install lightdm as a replacement for gdm and when I start it, i just get a black screen
 I then stopped lightdm again and just ran startx
 I get the desktop icons appearing and the mouse, but no menus, side bar and rightclick mensues
 when I try and click on an icon and trag it, the mouse Icon changes to a drag icon, but nothing actaully happens to the icons ont he desktop
 does unity REQUIRE 3d >
 ah
 that might be my problem then
 is there a 2d version or something I can do to make it work on older hardware >
 Skei: i also seem to have this problem
 still looking for a solution
 nvidia 8300
 Skei: I tried it, but then X didn't even start
 i  installed the nvidia 270.41.06 and also seem to have issues
 ActionParsnip: Actually I have a 7300 not 8300
 ActionParsnip: whre can I get that ?
 ok
 ok dl'ing
 ActionParsnip: how will I force that driver to be used?
 so i must make sure it is corect there before reboot?
 ActionParsnip: ok, now I get a login screen at least
 ok, now I am just get frustrated. i installed lightdm, and now I can get to the login screen. I can select sessions and I have tried classic, Classic (no effects) and ubuntu recovery and all of them boots Unity and I can't do see anything change in the X sessions..
 I can click on an icon and drag it, but the icons stats on the screen
 if i restart the session, the icon has moved to where i dragged it too
 ok, I want to try and remove unity totally and see if I can can info X properly
 what woul be the best way to remove unity?
 how can I see all the versions of the nvidia drivers that are installed?
 is ther an apt-get command for that?
 not to shoot it down, But I have been having massive graphics issues
 eiriksvin: don't know, but I have same problem
 so far most complains seem to be NVida and Unity related
 busy installing
 still no luck with these damn drivers
 ok, I uninstalled UNITY, I uninstalled ALL the NVIDIA drivers, I then downloaded the latest NVDIA drivers from NVIDIA direclty. I rebooted and lightDM comes up. I can login, bit only the icons on the desktop are displayed, i can't interactect with them or do anyting else. No window manger loads...
 It looks like the Xorg is the problem not unity
 TheHackOps: I just tried it and it doesn't work for me
 TheHackOps: nope, no errors that is why I am ready to cry
 lol
 I can login
 I selected classic, noeffects , safemode
 all of them
 I get to the desktop
 the icons are there
 But I can't interact with the desktop
 TheHackOps: ok, I tried to update the vboxdrv earlier and it comaplined that the worng version of the header files are installed
 cablop: how do I change to the classic gnom?
 TheHackOps: I have had no craches
 I just can't believe that they relieased it with so many issues
 Xorg and Virtual box stoped workign uppon upgrading to 11.04
 currently on the default unity
 TheHackOps: want to try and go back to classic now
 to see if that works
 DasEi: what was that ?
 spungo: I am rebooting system all the time can't use something else right now
 cablop: I get  "e: unable to locate package gnome-desktop"
 DasEi: what format is it. the file name was just gnome
 ActionParsnip: the 173 nvidia had the exact same results
 DasEi: I can't get into the GUI,  I installed LightDM and on the login screen I see the option for classic. It goed the same problem
 oooooo
 something happend
 I used unity --replace
 gave a lot of test on the screen and the X start didn't work
 I CTRL + C the unity--replace
 and then when I went back to X
 the icons I clicked on had opned apps
 and I can iinteract witht he icons on the desktop now
 I don't currently have a window manger running but i can now atleast interact
 ok,so now it is not a driver issue anymore, but it looks like an unity issue
 gnome here i come
 cablop: I don't have menus to click on, this doesn't really help
 cablop: I tried it, I can't get the classic to display on login
 cablop:  the option is there. i select it, i login and then i get stuck
 I can't interact with the desktop
 ok, once, I get unity killed off , i can interact with the desktop
 what is the apt-get command to list for instance all the compiz packages that can be installed?
 TheHackOps: I have not tried to install compiz, using it without unity and as soon as I run a window manger, I can't interact with the desktop anymore
 sorry, to say this, but so far my experince with natty has been horrible. all the previous versions worked witout a glitch, I upgraded from 9.04 all the way to 10.10 and now this upgrade ruined everything
 how do i get unity 2d to work ?
 Wrong Kernel version in the Make File that came default withthe kernel headers
 so I could not compile vboxdrvs
 GDM doesn't work
 I installed lightdm and that works
 I can get a log screen then
 with GDM the Dosktop icons are diplayed, but the GDM window is invissble
 when i move the mouse over the locations there the login nd password should go the mouse curor changes
 to edit icon
 but my keyboard doesn't work
 if I run unity --replace and then kill it from a console the window manger is killed, but the xorg keeps running
 then my keyboard works and I can interact with the icons on the desktop
 Sofar I have not been able to get into my Xwindows
 Dr_Willis: what is the unity 2d package name >
 i tried unity2d
 will try that
 that is installing thanks
 now, how will i configure it to use the 2d version in place of the 3d verison with out using gdm ?
 Dr_Willis: do you know what I need to edit to use the 2d version in place of the 3d version ?
 robin0800: my GDM doesn't work
 I get can't see anything of GDM
 robin0800: yes
 ok, so now things are getting worse, When I now try and get to a console, the mouse stays on the screen and the text cursor flashes on the screen and then I am dead in the water
 robin0800:did that already
 robin0800: I restarted PC
 now I just a black screen after the syste loads
 robin0800: you don't seem to understand, i don't get a login screen
 it is just a blank screen
 Nickname_: probably
 going to uninstall the NVidia one and install the ubuntu one agian
 I see a re-install of ubuntu 10.10 coming my way
 dncrash: i tink unity --reset
 but I had no luck with that
 dncrash: that serts all settings
