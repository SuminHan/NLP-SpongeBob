 Umm, just put on ubuntu 11.4, looks OK.  where do i get the admin menu from?
 kezzawd: I have shortcuts from super, and a dock on the left.
 kezzawd: is there still a menu for admin tools and another for applications i can access.
 cmdbbq: yeh but sometimes i want something i can't remeber the name of.
 Also for someone new to the features of ubuntu they don't have the chance to play with items. they have to find them a very hard way. it's nice just to see the admin tools in a list sometimes.
 OK thanks everyone
 OH yeh it's possible from the super/icon browse section.
 you can change options search result on the right and select system.
 then then a few come up you click system again and the full list will appear.
 paspro: I didn't know, thats why i was here asking. thanks to others i found it, so I just put up my findings.  If you knew you could have said!! :) - no point after iv'e solved it.
