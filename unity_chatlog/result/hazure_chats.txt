 I'm encountering a problem where many applications just show a white screen when started (after logging in for a bit). They seem responsive, but just white. Ditto with the lockscreen (full screen goes white, but the password can be put in).
 Anyone know of a rendering issue with unity showing only white screens for gnome apps?
