 question for y'all: running 10.10 with wine 1.3, I installed the game Rift, everything works great except when game runs it's ~5 fps and all of the textures are black.  Any idea?  I've googled like a madman and can't figure it out.
 is anyone else not particularly happy with gnome 3?  or does it just take time to work its way into my heart?
 is gnome3 really not customizable?  For instance, moving launcher panel, allowing multiple instances of something like chrome to be launched from launcher, etc?
 can someone explain to me how to move the launcher panel to the bottom of the screen in gnome 3?
 question:  I may be missing something, but in gnome3, can you really not move the launcher bar?
