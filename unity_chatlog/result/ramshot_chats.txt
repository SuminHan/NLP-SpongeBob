 Heya, just upgraded to 11.04 and I'm impressed so far, but one thing is driving me nuts... How do I launch a new instance from the launcher instead of switching to one already opened? I've tried alt/ctrl/shift/etc and just can't find it / google it :)
 Heh, I see I'm not the only one with the same quetion %)
 ror: I found one page saying that middle mouse button could work, but for me it doesn't, try it if you haven't.
 Okay then, how do I get my middle mouse button to work, anyone? :D
 I'm great thanks, but I'd be better if my middle mouse button worked :)
 ror: Btw, afaik it's possible to easily switch to the old gnome configuration still would should be about the same experience as 10.04
 From the login screen afaik
 This is just weird... middle button seems to launch a new instance... like 1/3 of the times I try it
 Heya, 11.04 seems great but I'm flipping out because I can't find where to change the shift-alt-up shortcut, which is basically "expo for current workspace only"
 Anyone know where I can change it, if anywhere?
 Dr_Willis: Yeah, I have that, but I can't find it anywhere. I can only find the super+w one under the expo plugin, but that does expo for all apps.
 Greets. I'm having some trouble with Unity. When it merges the software tool bar with the top bar, it seems to be leaving out some of the menu items. For example, Zend studio is missing "File" and "Help". And there are items missing even under the menus that are there. Seems strange to me, a bug or a setting?
 I don't suppose there's any way to get the search functionality (super-key) from unity into "ubuntu classic"? :)
 Loved it, but had too many problems with Unity otherwise
 coz_: Well, it seemed to search both, but either would be better than none :)
 coz_: Yeah, but it's not instant / as well designed as the unity one, but guess I'll have to settle, thanks :)
