 you dont have to use unity if you dont want to
 is there a way to pre-download a dist-upgrade?
 thegoodcushion, you can login using "Ubuntu Classic"  and get the current (previous) gui
 mbrochh, must be using virtualbox 4.0.6
 mbrochh, what petey said, plus you may need to adjust the memory quantities (check video especially)
