 hey, i want to reasamble a livecd of ubuntu 10.10 with static resolv.conf entries. i have loopemounted the squashfs and copied into a new folder, added the correct resolv.conf and made a new squasfs out of it via mksquashfs, but if i boot the new livecd there is no ubuntu live cd user, i'm stuck at the gdm login-screen, is there anything special i have to consider if i reassamble the squashfs of the livecd ?
