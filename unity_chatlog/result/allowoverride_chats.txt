 im trying to install ubuntu with in windows xp. can someone look at my wubi log? http://pastebin.com/VmSqL6EG give me some suggestions to dual boot this box. thanks
 beoyndcr: just came out, more bloat
 spikebike: i think the default is 30 days ;)
 bp0: oh
 bp0: im not able to do it otherwise though... trust me
 spikebike: what file is that setting in? i want to check mine
 nah, no man pages, ill just look at the config
 ;)
 spikebike: how did you know its 180
 spikebike: im pretty sure i have changed that setting b4 last year, just dont remember the file name
 spikebike: thats nice, im new to linux
 ok,, brb ill find out, thanks
 spikebike:  first of all, there is no man tunefs, maybe tune2fs though, your credentials are dwindling
 brb
 yah, now i remember it a bit, i think its a cmd that you make the change in.
 been a while
 pfifo: ?

 yep pastebin added a new capcha lol
 mikinanuq: i think squashfs is the culprit, but i dont know howto fix that...
 mikinanuq: i also have a an ubuntu installer error, on my screen on that box
 mikinanuq: says permission denied, however, im logged in with admin perms on xp. odd
 http://pastebin.com/nqiu6HBh
 mikinanuq:  yep that links works
 mikinanuq: lol,, i know huh,,, i didnt config that log function
 mikinanuq: prolly towards the bottom
 mikinanuq: maybe this one will work better, its newer.... http://pastebin.com/58SgFsQF
 mikinanuq: thanks for taking a alook. :)
 mikinanuq: what is the next step you think?
 mikinanuq: i just noticed something,,, this doesnt make sense... i know i downloaded 11.04 today, 32 bit, 11-13 06:26 DEBUG Â Distro: wrong arch: i386 != amd64
 check out line 195
 mikinanuq: check out line 195
 mikinanuq: does that make any sense?
 mikinanuq: no way,, thats just rediculious,,,
 mikinanuq: i know i selected 32 bit... let me triple check
 mikinanuq: yah that would make sense huh
 mikinanuq: good old slack days lol
 compile everything!
 mikinanuq: im just gonna burn 10.10 again, and go with that,, i think the 11.04 makefile or whatever they use - wubi, is hosed
 mikinanuq: yep i downloaded i386 positively, however, i downloaded it on a 64bit box, burned to cd, then did the wubi install, i have no other option but to dual boot this box
 the bios is from an real old laptop, pre2000
 mikinanuq: maybe thats why im getting the squashfs error,,, and yes,, i cant boot to cdrom with out disabling in bios the hd. which of course means, i can load to hd if disabled lol
 mikinanuq: i have a catch 22 going here
 im pretty much at a stand still... i have no idea what i can do next to get this box to dual boot other than the i386/64amd error which makes sense,,, anyone else have some thoughts? http://pastebin.com/nqiu6HBh
 i think also the permissions issue error on xp shows, that its creating an Ubuntu dir on c:\Ubuntu which means, the perms on C drive are mucked up
 html_inprogress: thats a good idea, i was thinking bout safe mode, but the perms issue, will that work out in the end lol
 only one way to find out,,, ill give it a whirl, safe mode. oh and there is no grub menu at this point.... i havent gotten grub on the drive yet...
 if i did, i wouldnt have this issue lol
 lol
 no floppy shrugs

 nope, same issue, unable to boot to ubuntu with wubi, im now trying 9.10 desktop 32. also, i think the i368 was not an error, but a check

 welp, 9.10 got farther that the 11.04 wubi
 looks good, going for reboot ;) apparently the new 11.04 wubi is hosed... someone advised buntu devs.

 html_inprogress: ok, can you assist, im at the grub after rebooting with wubi safely assist loading cd rom. i selected Ubuntu first menu, then pressed escape at nfts 0,0 screen, which now im i see bsimage loading,,, and its hanging.... im using 9.10 desktop cd which is now reinserted, however, i do not think it should be... since it downloaded to the hd a c:\Ubuntu dir with all the files it needs... 1. do i need to be in saf
