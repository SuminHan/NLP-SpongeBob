 @DAtevayo there are 2 ways to install java
 @Datebayo once is using the add/remove software
 @datebayo
 @datebayo the other with the terminal something like sudo apt-get install java
 @datebayo there is a third one from the web
 @datebayo you type www.java.com
 @datebayo the web will find out that your S:O is linux and i will offer a download
 @datebayo, did this help?
