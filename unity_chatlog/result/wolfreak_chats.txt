 @oetzi try restarting, going to the recovery mode at the beginning menu then hit "Failsafe graphics mode"
 @blackbit you have doublevision?
 Or just use an online client. http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu is what I'm on
 @norbert are you on 11.04?
 @norbert do you have 2 bars at the top and bottom? or just one at the top?
 @norbert log out, at the bottom hit "Ubuntu classic mode", that'll give you the old look back
 @ar71k  on any reddit page, type ".rss" at the end of the url and you'll get the rss feed. for ubuntu, it'll be http://www.reddit.com/r/ubuntu.rss
 I'm back,. Baskak, do you need help?
 sorry, hold on let me read this lol i had to get my water :P.
 Are you using a different language intentionally?
 @Baskak, try logging out, hitting "Ubuntu Classic" at the bottom.
 and you've tried recovery mode too?
 the failsafe graphics mode in recovery mode?
 That's, strange.. I would go ahead and give it a reinstall, unless you already have. surely if it's a fresh install you haven't downloaded much to lose
 I understand how you feel. I created a new partition for my home and usr since I reinstalled it so much.
 so rather than losing my files and whatnot, it just reset the system files, excluding my home folder and application files.
 @ActionParsnip Yeah I know, but I mean like when you go reinstalling ubuntu you have to format the partition, so I have a dedicated partition to my home folder. :P
 @Baskak, try posting a post on http://reddit.com/u/ubuntu
 No some are experts here, but it's night at the US and other places.
 http://reddit.com/r/ubuntu that's it, sorry haha.
 don't try ubuntuforums, they don't ever help, they just leave you hanging then mark you solved even tho it wasn't. use linuxforums.
 @baskak but yeah I'd go ahead and make a post on reddit, that's a very popular site and you'll be sure to have quite a few replies inthe morning =]
 what do you mean highlight? lol.
 and I know i can lose my stuff but I do back it up once every month or so.
 I'm not that concerned about my data.all I really do is use firefox, listen to music on grooveshark, and download porn. I'm not like running a server or anything lol
 andeeeuk: not in unity, but if you log out, hit "ubuntu classic" at the bottom, you'll get the classic gnome look.
 Your choice haha.
 ActionParsnip: haha heck yeah, if you have a GS account feel free to add me man, http://grooveshark.com/#/user/wolfreak/3512811?src=5
