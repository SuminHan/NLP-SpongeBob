 tested 11.04 via thumbdrive - unity loaded fine. just upgraded and now it says i don't have the hardward for it. what can i do?
 just upgraded to 11.04..unity worked fine when testing off a thumb drive.. after the upgrade, got a message about my hardward not meeting the requirements.. and no unity.. what can be done?
 my hardward clearly works fine
 rgr, there is no message about the hardware in specifics.. it just says that you don;t have the right hardawrd to run unity..yet it worked fine off the thumb drive
 rgr, i don;t know where to find that
 anyone else experiencing tons of problems with dual screen? i was hoping it would be fixed in 11.04. seems much worse, especially with unity.
 vivid: yea.. i'm getting 8 workspaces now..and windows are being sent to each of them automatically.. maximized windows get cut off and you can't see the top of them, etc
 ah
 my problem with 10.10 was that if you disabled the external monitor, they both went blank..and you had to reboot
 anyone use qutecom? unity won't let me dock it..wonder why
 anyone notice how unity screws up when you 'X' an application that minimizes to the system tray when 'X'ed? is there a way to fix that so it keeps the icon? otherwise it keeps running int eh back and you can't get to it..
