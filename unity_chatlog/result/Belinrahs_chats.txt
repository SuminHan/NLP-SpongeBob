 does anyone have experience installing Ralink wifi drivers on ubuntu? I can never make them work
 its just called the 5390 as far as I know
 celthunder: not sure if it told you i replied, its the ralink 5390
 I posted on forums: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1742650 , I installed 10.10 on my hp g62x, WLAN didn't work, followed a guide online to compile and set up ralink driver. I can see networks, when I try and connect to one the animated WiFi icon on the top bar freezes if I click it
 btw natty I can't even compile the driver so i reverted to 10.10
 _Platypus_: not quite sure what you mean by a widescreen effect?
 _Platypus_: you need to set your screen resolution to a widescreen format
 _Platypus_: Just a moment
 !resolution | _Platypus_
 _Platypus_: That link should help you fix your resolution
 _Platypus_: if you need more help, mention me again and I'll see it
 DJRoby4: hello, can we help you?

 Janusman: in ubuntu you should be able to upgrade normally
 !upgrade | Janusman
 Janusman: anytime
 Janusman: Should be a completely normal upgrade, I'm using Wubi and I upgraded normal
 Nunya: off topic, but I really like how you have your interface set up :)
 anyone with wifi experience could you look at my post, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1742650 -- I would be very grateful - thanks!
 Acriax: 64 is as stable as 32, it's what I use, never an issue
 I hate to ask but would someone look at my forum post and maybe make a suggestion? It's WiFi related

 For the record: If you really hate Unity, just choose Ubuntu Classic when you login and everything back to normal. Thank you.
 is it possible to change the indicator in the top right of the screen from my username to my full name?
 Can I change where it says my username (belinrahs) to my full name on the top right corner of the regular GNOME desktop?
 Juest: if you don't mind my asking, what applet, and how is it added? synaptic?
 can I change the title of the Me Menu to my full name? It's currently my username
