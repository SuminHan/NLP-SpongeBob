 Anyone else has a problem with xhci_hcd timeout and mouse / keyboard stop working with the natty kernel?
 aravinda: tried rebooting?
 aravinda: could be a pulse audio issue hanging in another session
 aravinda: pulseaudio running?
 aravinda: press "alt F2"
 aravinda: and type: pulseaudio &
 aravinda: after that, retry opening the sound stuff
 aravinda: try "alt F2" and afterwards: pulseaudio -d
 aravinda: if this does not work, killing pulseaudio and restarting would be an idea.
 aravinda: run the command: pulseaudio -k
 aravinda: afterwards pulseaudio -d
 and retry
 Monotoko: it will
 Monotoko: you do not have to reinstall, it is not windows :-)
 aravinda: does not work, or does it?
 aravinda: sorry, no idea from here - did it ever work bevore?
 aravinda: is skype currently running? could block your sound device
 aravinda: nskype does not change any system settings concerning audio
