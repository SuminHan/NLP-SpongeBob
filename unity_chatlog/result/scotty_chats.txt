 nmaxchat - You could look in Synaptic package manager or search the Ubuntu packages on Launchpad.
 Hi all.  Does anyone know if there is a tracking bug in Launchpad  for anatty kernel upgrade to either 2.6.38.3 or 2.6.38.4?
 brandonc503 - Don't delete those files!  They are important.  To see them in Ubuntu, select "Show Hidden Files" from the View menu in Nautilus.
 andeeeuk - I like using nn for a newsreader.
 andeeeuk I use nn for a newsreader
 The commands take a little while to remember but it's very heavy duty.
 I'm not familiar with pan I'm afraid.

 oops - let me try that again

 That's better.
 nmaxchat - Or u can just browse to the tar.gz archive in Nautilus and double-click it, which will open it in file-roller (called Archive Manager in the Titlebar).
 Just select one of your Places, such as Home Folder or Documents or Pictures or Downloads and navigate from there to your file.
 or do what PythonPup said and type nautilus at a terminal prompt.
 SoftarPaul - u don't have a panel any more because you are not using GNOME anymore, u are using Unity.
 If you want to use GNOME on Natty, select Ubuntu Classic Desktop during boot (before login).
 Umm, I'm trying to remember.  I'm using Lucid as I type this.
 Natty is installed on my other machine.
 Try clicking Applications near the bottom of the Launcher on the left side of your desktop.
 ajah - IIRC, that's under Applications, then click the little arrow which says either "Show all applications" or "See more applications".
 jarek - A new one.
 Doesn't have to be a powerful one though.
 jarek - I have two machines with ATI Radeon HD5450 cards which work well with Natty.  NVIDIA cards and recent Intel integrated graphics are working well for most people too.
 For older Intel integrated graphics there is a bug which has been fixed in a pending SRU for Natty - see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/727594
 jarek - yeah, as Dr_Willis says, u should probably avoid SIS.  There is a least one bug report on Launchpad where a user with SIS graphics cannot run Unity. IIRC the SIS driver has not had much maintenance for a while now.
 Alarcron - it was implemented in the open-source drivers a while ago, and the newly released ATI Catalyst 11.4 driver also supports PowerXpress (ie. switchable GPUs).
 jarek - I could be wrong but I thought I heard that Unity was working with the Noveau open-source NVIDIA drivers.  Dr_Willis might be able to confirm that.
 OK, ignore, my last comment.  I  just read the ubottu comment about nouveau.
 Dr_Willis - Re Sis: perhaps plague was the word you were looking for :)
 Viking667 - What ATI card do u have?
 Viking667 - The ATI Radeon HD3450 (R600 I think, or maybe R700) should be relatively error free on Unity, unlike the early R100 (Radeon 7000) and R200 (Radeon 8000) cards.  If you are getting artifacts try searching Launchpad for similar bugs.
 vigor - Maybe, I'm using XChat-GNOME now.
 vigor - Xchat only supports the IRC protocol.
 vigor - I think Empathy is the program in Karmic and later Ubuntu versions that can do what u want.  It uses Telepathy for protocol support.
 SmokingKipper - it will depend on the usage load on the site/mirror you are downloading from.
 Viking667 - np.

 LunaVorax_mini - I would advise against using RAID-0 - I had a bad experience with it.  From Wikipedia, "Any disk failure destroys the array, and the likelihood of failure increases with more disks in the array (at a minimum, catastrophic data loss is twice as likely compared to single drives without RAID)."
 LunaVorax_mini - Try RAID-5 or Intel's Matrix RAID if you have an Intel Southbridge chip.
 LunaVorax_mini - Or maybe RAID 0+1 if you have plenty of disks (minimum four disks; even number of disks).
 LunaVorax_mini - OK then.
 trailoryou - Smooth playback of HD video will depend not only on your media player but also on your video card and maybe your CPU.  What version of Ubuntu are you using?
 kill3 - What video card/chip do you have?
 kill3 - pls paste glxinfo | grep render
 jodlajodla - please define "additional ati drivers" - do you mean fglrx (also known as Catalyst)?
 Glycan - OK, if that didn't work, try using Synaptic package manager to install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg, gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad and gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly. gstreamer0.10-plugins-good should already be installed but if it's not, install it.
 kau_mad - Optimus is not currently supported on Linux - see http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTM3NA
 Trashi - someone mentioned b4 that there was a Firefox extension to integrate it's menu with Unity - I'm guessing Thunderbird needs something similar.
 Trashi - hmm.  Good question.  What happens if you double-click on the .xpi file in Nautilus?
 Trashi - otherwise maybe booting into Ubuntu Classic and installing it, then booting back into Unity will work.

 Glycan - Cool.
 Glycan - I believe the command you want is mv.
