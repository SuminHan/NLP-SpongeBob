 glaceon, what did you tried?
 glaceon, on one computer you have to install the ssh-server. use "sudo apt-get install openssh-server"
 glaceon, after that you have to connect to the computer. use the ip from "ifconfig" for you network-device
 glaceon, go to the other computer and look if the both are in the same network (try ping IP FROM THE OTHER PC)
 glaceon, and then you have to connect via "ssh IP FROM THE OTHER"
