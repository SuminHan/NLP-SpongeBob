 hi guys
 I keep losing wifi connectivity with a netbook over wifi
 Would updating to 11.04 update my wifi drivers?  My netbook keeps freaking disconnecting
 Is there an 11.4 netbook edition?
 I am having trouble with my netbook wifi
 i can go on IRC, i can update etc, but DNS not opening web pages.
 my dns isnt resolving!
 Help me! Oh my word, my DNS does not resolve@!
 Guys, any reason why ubuntu would just lose DNS every now and then?
 how do you monitor DNS on ubuntu?
