 I'm running Ubuntu in a virtual machine on OS X. I have a UK Macbook keyboard where alt+3 is the way to insert a hash/octothorpe/number sign.
 Does anyone know of a good way to get this or something similar working on ubuntu?
 Omega: What option in Keyboard Preferences would allow me to type a hash?
 Omega: Shift-3 is Â£.
 (which is correct)
 Omega: Looks like turning on left-alt-to-3rd-level gets me # on alt-3 ... but it also disables other alt-based functionality
 Omega: alt-whatever to open a menu
 Omega: right-alt-to-3rd-level seems to work better.
 Omega: any alt disables alt-[letter] to open a menu too
 Omega: oh interesting looks like right-alt+3 gives # by default
 I can probably live with that
 Is anyone else having problems with PECL/PEAR failing to find packages on Ubuntu Lucid?
 Got this problem on 2 VMs now.
