 What is the default IRC client for 10.04 ?
 Or does it not come with one?
 Sidewinder1: That's what I thought.... Ok.
 Sidewinder1: If someone does not have Xchat, they they must not have a full install.  Right?  Or...?
 idefix: see my PM
 pfifo: I've replaced network-manager with wicd and like it better.  It is simplier / easier to use.
 krad: upstart is installed by default
 !upstart | krad
 krad: Are you saying upstart by mistake? (Typo maybe?)
 krad: Did you un-install upstart?
 krad: Oh, I see.  ... hummm not sure what to do now..  Where does it hang on bootup?  Where are you at now?
 krad: If you can... just re-install it.
 krad: So you booted from a Slackware CD?  Is that what you are saying?
 krad: Yea, as pfifo says, just re-install upstart.  sudo apt-get install upstart
 pfifo: well, just apt-get install upstart
 pfifo:  what did you have installed in the first place?  What distro, what version?
 krad:  what did you have installed in the first place?  What distro, what version?
 krad: dpkg -i upstart
 iceroot: install upstart
 iceroot: O

 emj: install x11vnc on his PC and use vncviewer on yours.  (Install tightvnc on yours.)
 emj: They are both Ubuntu?
 emj: Ok. Rocky can prolly help you.
 Linuxfav: And you have installed Nvidia driver on it?
 Linuxfav: Do you think that bypassing the proprietary driver will help?
 Linuxfav: sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak   #Will bypass it.
 Linuxfav: And will put you back on the open-source driver.
 some_dude1234: Turn off encryption on the router and try it.

 s33k: What command did you use to copy the /home files to the new partition?
 s33k: and what exactly is the  .gfs  file?
 s33k: So the /dev/sda7 partition is for /home only?
 s33k: bp0 is correct.
 bp0: s33k But you CAN copy it.
 s33k: bp0 and then delete /home later.
 s33k: What  you should have done is   sudo mkdir /mnt/sda7 ; sudo mount /dev/sda7 /mnt/sda7 ; sudo cp -ar /home /mnt/sda7
 s33k: Actually first you need to   sudo mv home/ old-home/  and then do the above.  Then change fstab entry and reboot.  If all works well, then rm -rf old-home/
 s33k: and what exactly is the  .gfs  file?
 s33k: ls -l .gfs
 s33k: file .gfs
 s33k: ls -l .gfs > gfs-info ; file .gfs >> gfs-info ; pastebinit gfs-info ; rm gfs-info
 s33k: chmod 777 .gfs
 s33k: is this .gfs file something you really need?
 !google
 s33k: chmod 777 .gfs/
 s33k: and then   mv .gfs/ /home/were/ever/it/is/supposed/to/go
 antihero: You mean writable?
 antihero: If you mean writable, open a terminal and do chmod +w  file-name.doc

 Ultimate_Chaos: You can login to a console session and add a user.
 omidp: Do you need to establish a network connection via wireless or wired?
 omidp: If you have established a network connection you can install network-manager or wicd.  (I use wicd - it is a bit simplier.)
 omidp: sudo apt-get install wicd
 andeeeuk: I have used newsgroups before.

 nmaxchat: Herbs is correct, what you have more than likely downloaded is a tarball.
 nmaxchat: Yes
 nmaxchat: What is it that you are wanting to install?
 nmaxchat: What is your end goal?
 nmaxchat: where did you download from?
 nmaxchat: https://www.dropbox.com/downloading?os=lnx   #This site?

 nmaxchat: Yep, there you go....
 How does one convert a system to LTS?
 PythonPup: Ok, thanks.
 botcity: What do you mean, which LTS?
 botcity: I'm talking Long Term Support
 PythonPup: If the system is 9.04 now, will the LTS option be available in the update manager & package manager?  (Or will it first need to be updated to 10.04.)
  ....... Anyone  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,..........^^^
 PythonPup: VCoolio: Ok, here is the situation.  A friend of mine had 8.04.  I thought it was LTS, and told him to just do the distribution upgrade. Well, now he's on 9.04.
 VCoolio: What do you mean "updated version twice"?
 VCoolio: Well, he said he was on 8.04, now he's on 9.04  I don't know how he got there, but, well, I'll just have to wait and see when I get there.
 VCoolio: Well, again, I'll find out when I get there.  I'm going over there sometime next week, was just wondering how it worked.  No big deal.
 PythonPup: Ok, thanks info
 PythonPup: VCoolio atlef Thanks for the info.  I
 PythonPup: VCoolio atlef Thanks for the info.  I'm hoping to wait for the traffic to simmer down, maybe next week and then do somethig with it.
