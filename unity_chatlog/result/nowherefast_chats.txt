 hello
 would someone possibly be able to help me with a wifi related issue that I am having? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1742299
 easy way out
 does anyone know how to completely remove wifi drivers in ubuntu 10.10?
 is anyone farmiliar with blacklisting drivers and would be able to help?
 kbrosnan: i am trying to uninstall my current wifi driver
 kbrosnan: so that i can install a new driver with ndiswrap
 kbrosnan:from what i understand i need to blacklist the current wifi driver and uninstall the module
 tamer: you're probably having the same problem i am currently having
 tamer:have you tried connecting with wicd?
 tamer: type sudo apt-get install wicd
 tamer: then open it and try to connect to a network
 ohsix: it has worked for me in the past
 ohsix: i have intel 3945abg
 ohsix: how i have the same problem using 10.10 on an eee
 ohsix:no
 ohsix: i forget the name but its 10.10
 ohsix: i can view networks but i cannot connect to them
 ohsix:i was able to connect one time, but it dropped
 ohsix: i am not sure what driver i am currently using
 ohsix: ive exhausted all other options
 ohsix: any ideas that are more linuxy? love to hear them : )
 ohsix: thats already done
 ohsix: i am not but all files that were edited were changed and i think reboot will change the modprobes
 ohsix: from what i have read besides driver issue it could be a bluetooth issue (solved using rfkill) application issue (wicd vs network manager) or id issue (not displaying in iwconfig) and its not so i must assume its a driver or driver conflict
 ohsix: thanks, the meat and potatos seem to be associating -> disconnected
 ohsix: it gives the reason as 0
 ohsix: do i have power saving enabled on my router? i don't think so
 ohsix: yeah it looks like it gets to stage 3 of 5 then disconnects
 ohsix: the contents can be found in the final reply in my thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10734573#post10734573
 tamer: glad it worked, couldn't tell you honestly why it works : P
 ohsix: do you think installing a new driver would solve the problem?
 ohsix: the problem is i cannot connect to any wifi networks
 ohsix: are you talking about sudo apt-get install linux-backports?
 ohsix: if so no
 ohsix: i have tried with 3 networks on 3 diff routers and my eee has the same problem on 10.10
 ohsix: definately other problem
 ohsix: ive read different drivers are different quality with many wifi cards in ubuntu
 ohsix: for example the highly variable outcomes of madwifi vs ath9k vs ndis + windows in transfer speeds, etc
 ohsix: how do i disable power saving?
 ohsix: ah... yeah, disabled
 ohsix: nope : (
 ohsix: do you know the command to ID a driver?
 ohsix: i am going to throw 9.04 as my wifi works out of the box on that release and see if it's using the same driver
 ohsix: hah! its showing iwl3945, notorious for problems
 ohsix: what else could it be?
 ohsix: i have a cheap chinese made router
 ohsix: it probably doesnt have a name in english : P
 ohsix: should i black list the module, then use modprobe to remove the module, then i can use the ndiswrapper gui to install the windows driver? that sound about right?
 ohsix: the chip is crap, but i am at peace with that. since the madwifi driver is made for atheros chipsets i plan on using that one since it has the best ratings on that chipset
 ohsix: ohsix: the router zxv10 w300 but i also have a repeater i use to test the wifi network with and both fail
 ohsix: the repeater is a tlwa500g
 ohsix: not physically but i have admin axx via browser
 ohsix: i can use it in monitor mode perfectly fine
 ohsix: it doesn't seem to want to work in managed mode though
 ohsix: i tested different drivers on the netbook (eee) and the ath9k driver works in ubuntu 9.04 but not in 10.10... weird huh
 what version of ubuntu is natty?
