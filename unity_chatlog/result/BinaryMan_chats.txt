 I gotta ask a super important question. I'm using Lucid x86_64 on my primary machine (consider it a production machine). Hard drive is encrypted with LUKS. Should I upgrade to Natty or will things possibly break?
 acicula: I can't. I don't have the same machine to play with.
 Or.
 Actually.
 I take that back.
 acicula: GPU hangs at random and I have to REISUB to fix.
 acicula: integrated intel
 acicula: don't think so. Atom N550
 usr13: i know.
 acicula: my mistake. N455
 usr13: i have client machines running ubuntu in a computer lab with video issues and the issues was closed, suggest I upgrade to natty due to improved video card support.
 usr13: so, I'm banking on the hope that natty would also fix my video issues.
 usr13 acicula: i'll make a dd image of /boot and the LUKS partiton. if something breaks, I can boot from a liveCD and push the images back to the hard drive like nothing ever happened.
 is there something wrong with all of the 64-bit natty iso images?
 i've tried the same image from two different mirrors, burned it with two different machines, and the CD dies when trying to load the initrd
 i can't get it to _boot)
 *_boot_
 i even had another guy burn the image with his computer.
 feisar: better luck than me. i can't get a livecd environment from the burned iso.
 hi. upgraded to 11.04 and started using xfce. it's not respecting the keyboard shortcuts I have set up.
 xadhoom: it doesn't. you can specify your own mountpoints.
 xadhoom: you don't have to. when you get to the partitioning screen, set the mountpoints by hand.
 xadhoom: that's because /blahblah isn't a recognized mount point.
 dimkin: only if the server your going to install it on has 64-bit hardware
