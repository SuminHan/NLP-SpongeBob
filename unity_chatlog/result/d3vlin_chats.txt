 is it possible to change the apt mirror that is being used by the natty installer?
 I tried changing sources.list in tty1 after booting the ISO, then firing the install, but no luck. still the default repository mirror
 It's kind of weird, the nl.archive.ubuntu.com allows about 100 kB/s, while nl3.arhive.ubuntu.com allows 6 MB/s, but stupid installer doesn't allow to change the mirror
 ohsix: :)
 I remember the debian installer had that feature ages ago, to select mirror during the install process
 the natty installer had a very nice fullscreen plymouth ubuntu boot/quit logo.. but after install at boot only a purple rectangle and at shutdown the ubuntu logo in low res. How can I fix this?
 installed natty x64 yesterday, booting shows only a big purple square, no logo. In syslog I see plymouth-splash terminating. Any clues? nvidia-current
 the installer CD had a wonderful fullscreen ubuntu splash (1920x1080?)
 I tried to get more verbose info during boot by removing quiet splash from /etc/default/grub but no luck, still showing the purple square

 i.e. # update-initramfs -v or -h doesn't show anything
 howdy.. I tried some things with compiz-configuration, but after restart when I boot into Unity all I get is background and pointer. How to restore menu's?
 how can I manually start the unity dock? I only have an empty desktop now with cursor
 jubei: a unity --reset and logging out/back in solved it for me
