 Hi guys, I came to ask a question (I've googled around beforehand for about 10 minutes).. You know how programs get installed to the /usr/bin file? Would there be any way of making it install into the home directory? (Not the settings, the entire program, say /home/joe/MyPrograms/Firefox)
 Buddhacz: I mean like with deb files or synaptic. I want to install my entire programs into my home folder so when I have to reinstall ubuntu (I do it often) I won't have to lose my programs. (I have /home on a seperate partition)
 Who was asking how to install an older firefox?
 Buddhacz: I mean I want to have 2 partitions, one for the ubuntu system, and one for home, I like trying alot of programs and I don't want to run out of space and choose between documents and programs
 Buddhacz: I thought programs install to /usr/bin?
 Buddhacz: I mean, look.. I download a bunch of documents (songs, porn, movies, etc), but I also download a bunch of programs (linux multimedia studio, jackd, etc) and even some that aren't in the synaptic. Everytime I do a fresh install I keep my songs porn and movies but I have to reinstall my other programs every time and it gets tedious. I have 250GB, and 60gb is for my windows (FL Studio), I have 120gb for my home, but with ha
 Buddhacz: Will that transfer my install folder to the home though? I'm not wanting to backup. I fuck up my computer too much to restore every time.
 Buddhacz: I'll just keep looking through the interwebz for ways, and if it comes down to it, I'll use that script you gave me and back it up. Thanks for trying to help me however.
 Buddhacz: It's just that my compiz fucked up and I can't figure out how to fix my xorg file so I'm wanting to do a reinstall and I just reinstalled it 3 days ago and I don't want to take even more backing up and restoring.
 Buddhacz: Thank you but, again, I'm not looking to back up my programs. I'm just wanting to fix this problem without having to reinstall all my shit yet again.
 Better yet, would anyone possibly know of a way to fix an xorg.conf without needing to reinstall linux? I've tried the dpkg configure thing but it didn't work.
 Buddhacz: wait, restore, will that erase the system, or will it just overwrite any existing files?
 Okay, drop the whole backup thing, I have another idea.. If I was to stick my live cd in and install it onto the / partition, will it erase any files or directories, or will it just replace the existing files?
 I don't want it to replace /usr/bin/(anything in here) to be replaced with /usr/bin when it's blank.
 Buddhacz: yeah that's true, just for safety reasons, I might do it then test to see it.  But about the Xorg, what was happening was just one day my compiz randomly took a shit. When I hover over the notifications to the right (11.04 with "ubuntu classic" so it's gnome 2), they vanish rather than becoming transparent., and my windows don't wobble.
 Buddhacz: hold on, I'll give you a copy of what the terminal says when I start compiz
 ikonia: okay, sorry
 Buddhacz: I'm back, sorry about that. http://pastebin.com/ASHz2SQG
 umm brb running that removed my window decorations, i has no exit so brb.
 back
 Buddhacz: http://pastebin.com/7w11T0eg
 But It was working for me before hand
 buddhacz: It was working for me before, well, before I tried to install gnome 3, it didn't let me choose themes though.. Maybe it might have been from me installing gnome 3 and then reverting back to gnome 2?
 Buddhacz: I have tried checking the additioanl drivers and I only seen my wifi driver, there was no graphics card driver.. and My manufacturers are too lazy to make ubuntu versions, and I doupt running a driver installer under wine would effect ubuntu
 I think I got an idea.. I'll be back in a few minutes to report if I succeeded or not
 Buddhacz: Thank you for all your help, I really appreciate it.
