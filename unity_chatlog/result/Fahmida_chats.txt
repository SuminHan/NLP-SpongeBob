 Hi, where does Ubuntu temporarily store videos from Youtube and similar sites?
 kellnola maxillusionist: Yeah, it was in /temp at first, but currently I see nothing in directory. :S
 Sorry, /tmp
 kellnola: I did perform ls -a, nothing. maxillusionist: yeah.
 maxillusionist: It is not like that I think. I just watched that video, didn't download it. I watched with Firefox.
 maxillusionist: In past, when I used to watch videos from those kind of site, Ubuntu stored it in /tmp
 maxillusionist: but currently, I see nothing in that directory. So, I am wondering where it is getting stored.
 ActionParsnip: I can, but I like that way.
 ActionParsnip: Actually, I have one. ;)
 usalabs: I see lots of folders named 1 2 3 4 5 A F D H ...
 In which one? Or I have to check 'em all? :S
 usalabs: I see 30/40 folders in each one. :(
 It becomes impossible to check for one single video. :S
 usalabs: Is there a graphical search panel?
