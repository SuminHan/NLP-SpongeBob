 My computers batery last longer in windows then in Ubuntu (Linux) Why is that?
 Why does ubuntu drains my batery ? :(
 I get about 5-8 hours on windows and 3-6 hours on ubuntu :(
 Does anyone know any way to get longer standby time in ubuntu... Like disable wlan, bluetooth etc
 I'm going to reinstall my Linux install and use Wubi to install Ubuntu, Witch version of Ubuntu is the best?
 What is the diffrence between Ubuntu and Ubuntu Netbook? Does a acer laptop with 500 gb harddrive, 4 gb ram, 1.3 gb Pentium Dualcore processor run best with ubuntu or ubuntu netbook?
 okey, and what is the diffrence?
 Okey, I will download ubuntu 11.04 - desktop ... with Wubi :)
 Thanks for your help :)
