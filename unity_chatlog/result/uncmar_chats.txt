 mrdeb: a mac or windows.  but, linux?  I don't know.  I won't buy an ipod.
 3 in the morning  Next stupid question.
 10.10 = 10 of 2010 or October.
 top_ramen: my name is annoyed beyond belief, so.. Um.  wann come stay in my area.  we got lots of tornadoes to go, round and round fer ya.
 6.06 should have come out on 6.6.6  It would have been a triplet but  more impressive, 6-6 1947? was Doomsday.
 Or rather, D-Day.
 anyhow. pooltable I don't know what time of day any of the releases where. sorry.
 hiexpo: which cashe?
 zvacet: nope, My 6.06 is currently broken, so right on the topic of why I'm here.
 because it was a running server.  that I didn't want to take time to upgrade.
 spending a DAY to upgrade/revive a system from an upgrade attempt stinks.
 zvacet: so, I just answered both questions with one answer.
 nope, Right out of ubuntu. though I must admint Ubuntu wasn't the reason for the failure.  *I AM*
 *admit
 I'd switch to fedora or.. well, I could eventually think of another, but I'm not ready to do a near Complete relearn of tools.
 Now I remember why I'm here.
 of course I could attempt to poke around the net.  Need to know system requirements of 8.04 Live CD.  I won't dare attempt 9.04 or 10.04
 I'm limited to 256Mb of ram.
 Hmm, it is time for 11.04.  Time flies.  I hadn't give it any thought.
 My upgrade attempt from 8.04 to 10.04 exploded, so I moved over to debian.  Closer to the trunk of the tree for stability.  Low and behold I have another dead ubuntu.
 the alternates are installs only?
 linuxman410: in the old days we would just smack the TV harder to fix the display. Or call the TV repair man.
 [Messer]: nah, but I'm a programmer.
 subpixel, things smaller than pixels?  what are those, pixels below pixels so that when you scale up it looks pretty?
 [Messer]: isn't it great?  Linux is taking over.  Well, at least becoming a bit more popular.
 eh, CRT's display with the same RGB combo.  Hence, 24 bit color.  8 bits per the trio.
 mrdeb: a mac or windows.  but, linux?  I don't know.  I won't buy an ipod.
