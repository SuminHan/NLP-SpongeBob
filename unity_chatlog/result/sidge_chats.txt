 hello all, my google-fu has failed me...how do i make dvd-roms automaont to a set mount point like they used ie /media/cdrom0
 jordan, have you turned off desktop effects under appearance?
 this is chaos, i need a better chat client, back in a bit
 Juest thats normal, those processes have nothing to do
 I have my chat working better now.  how do i get whatever part of ubuntu that automounts to put the mountpoint where i want it?
 netbook, have you tried the sound prefferences dialog?
 could maybe try alsamixer
 its a terminal app, i think its installed be default
 if not, it can be installed and then run from the terminal
 odd that it wasnt allready installed
 netbook, it should work to type alsamixer in the terminal, which is under accessories
 netbook you just installed the gui version which might work too, but ive not used it
 I have a lot of questions about fglrx configuration, where might be a good place to ask?
 siik, there might be a faster  way, but you can edit /ect/default/grub after booting a live cd
 netbook, im glad i managed to solve yout troublers :)  I have sound problems i never manage to toally beat it seems
 anyone ever set up fglrx/grub/kernel terminlas to the same resolution? is it possible/worth doing at 1080p
