 bashelina, mind the attitude. people here are volunteers.

 bashelina: an idea, why don't you try simply removing the packages for the scandinavian language ubuntu wants to use?
 bashelina: there is probably a better way, mind.
 bashelina: oh well install first, then worry about that later
 bashelina: if you haven't installed yet, then i think you'll find that after installation is done, you will have no big trouble setting a language different from your locale
 bashelina: well again i don't know, haven't used Natty... certainly the old installer inquired about the keyboard layout separately

 wolf__: "dmesg", even.
 m4rtin: so when running from CD everything works correctly?
 m4rtin: yeah but the "I/O error" is what worries me
 m4rtin: well i don't know, but for me a file not found error never was given as an I/O error, while I/O error has always meant there was something wrong reading the actual disk. so i still suggest you install smartmontools in the live CD and give the HDD a check.
 pumeust: the user crontab, or the global crontab?
 m4rtin: that file is in this package: http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/khelpcenter4 so you can always install this in the live CD, and then copy the file over to your HD.
 pumeust: what did you type to edit it
 pumeust: right, what command

 naryfa, i believe that depends on the program you're using. but i can give you a command line to see if the driver is actually capable of that, a moment
 naryfa: type "arecord -f dat -r 192000 -D hw:0,0 -d 5 test.wav" and see if it gives you any warning
 jdl: what kind of trouble
 naryfa: then it works with 192000 just fine, nothing to set up
 naryfa: ah right i forgot about the 24 bit part... but i don't think that specific command allows recording at 24 bit, so i don't know how you could check (perhaps install Audacity and try recording there)
 aauthor: i have no clue, however there is a forum thread which suggests also checking the permissions for /home/tom itself... seems unlikely, but
 xteejx: the "rename" program may help
 xteejx: it doesn't get any quicker than "rename", but it depends on what exactly you want to do.
 Deihmos: it is slow *because* it needs hardware acceleration ;)

 purvesh: the end result is the same, at least if you select "Ubuntu Desktop" on the alternate cd
 purvesh: you might also want to consider using the "minimal" cd, which is only about 10 or 20 megs and downloads everything from the internet while installing
 purvesh: basically yes, which means the installer is also different
 cxo: so you have it installed but it's not available, weird. maybe it was available in the CD you installed, did you install a beta ISO or the final? anyway does the command "gcc-4.3" work?
 purvesh: yes
 cxo: --config cc doesn't really work for me either, i think you will just have to export CC=gcc-4.3 when compiling things

 MnCC: if you need to copy stuff outside of your home folder that often, you're Doing It Wrong©
 MnCC: yes? but even if i didn't, i'd keep them somewhere i have permissions to, obviously
 MnCC: and if you're worried about upgrades (or for that matter, if you aren't), you use a separate partition for /home
 MnCC: well it's easier to do it during install than after, to be honest. you need gparted and a bit of console tinkering. shrink your / partition, make space for a /home partition, format it, copy everything from your old /home there, add the new /home to fstab, reboot, see if it works, if it works reboot into single user mode, delete stuff from old /home, done
 MnCC: i know unfortunately it's a bit involved if you do it after installing.
 MnCC: uhm, usually it's the whole /home that's put on a separate partition, not just a single user's directory inside /home.
 MnCC: so you might as well keep the one user you have now, you just need to know how to deal with single user mode in case things go wrong
 MnCC: that's another option
 MnCC: well, the only option if you need to resize the root partition to make space, really
