 why woul di have wireless durig live cd but after installation there i sno wireless
 i thought ubuntu was fast. this is really slow
 is there a way to install the wireless drivers from the cd?
 it is trying to download drivers instead
 does the new interface have hardware acceleration? it is really slow
 so at the moment there is no hardware acceleration?
 notebook has an ati card. windows is really smooth with it
 this is weird. wireless worked with the live cd but now i instaled and cannot get wireless working. tried enabling the drivers and got an error
