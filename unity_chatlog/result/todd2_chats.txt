 need some help with wifi problems on Dell Inspiron 1501
 cheapie: upgraded and now my wifi is turned "off"
 cheapie: no, try running some code last night to "activate STA", but didn't work
 cheapie: remind me how pastebin works?  Haven't done it in a long while
 cheapie: here's my ifconfig http://paste.ubuntu.com/603075/
 cheapie:  did not return anything
 cheapie: can't tell you what chip, but it's a Broadcom STA driver for Broadcom 4311
 edbian:  did that last night... nada
 cheapie:  here's the lsmod http://paste.ubuntu.com/603076/
 cheapie:  did the install, still no light on the wifi saying it's on... may have to restart? right?
 cheapie: out for a restart...
