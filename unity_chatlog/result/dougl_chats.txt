 how do I configure my ubuntu desktop on my network for static IP address?
 I am googling to change maveric from dhcp to static ip on local network but am getting a range of ways to do it - how do I change from dhcp to static IP on my maverick box on my local network?
 serene, will thanks for the input - I do have gnome running...
 escott, yes that sounds better/easier... do you have a url with instrructions?
 escott, I have a wrt54g2 linksys with 1.0.01 firmware - checking options for mac addresses
 escott, I dont see any options to assign ip to mac address?
 escott, googling tomato
 !staticip
 escott, yes I found it but still would be without the understanding of how to config for static ip
 escott, right... so I could flash the firmware and still not know how to assign ip address to mac addresses
 escott, thanks looking now
