 ugh
 getting an ugly 'Sorry no more PTYs' error
 on running screen for a user account?
 anyone?
 how can I unblock ttyp1?
 Cannot open your terminal '/dev/ttyp1' - please check.
 ok sorry
 arghs
 screen is fully dead for me
 the server went down
 and since it came back up this is an issue now
 any users apart from root cannot run screen now
 when one runs screen
 where is the ttyp directed?
 hi ikonia

 10.04
 LTS
 for the past um year xD
 it's a VPS
 been running fine
 and I've setup byobu under my usual account that I ssh into (keypair)
 not a box, it's a virtual container
 persm of?
 ttyp1 itself?
 yea but perms of what inside the cointainer
 ttyp1 itself or?
 annoying Plesk doesn't show me any perms
 *annoyingly
 Herbs will do when it's back up :)
 ok when I last sshed in
 2.6.18-028stab089.1 #1 SMP Thu Apr 14 13:46:04 MSD 2011 x86_64 GNU/Linux Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS
 ikonia: ok thanks.  yeah something is very wrong here.
 MediaTemple - and their support are being nasty about this issue
 sure it's a Linux VPS but when the container resets and I loose SSHd how the hell is it something I can manage?
 lols syn
 rm ?
 sudo rm rf *
 rm -rf /
 yea :)
 r = recursive
 f = force
 you need that for directories
 well / would wipe *everything*
