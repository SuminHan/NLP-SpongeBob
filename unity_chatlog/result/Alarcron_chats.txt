 Hello, this question has probably been asked since the worlds conception... However. Switcable GPUs. Has it been implemented yet? I seriously can not leave windows until tht has been properly fixed! :S
 Herbs ya...
 iceroot gah, well.. Then i have to wait until further notice then :(
 Herbs well actually... not to start a flame war or anything. Win7 really dont have to reboot more then when updating the internals so to speak ;) but i prefer ubuntu non the less.
 iceroot Oh god, please let it be so!
 well, sure it askes for a reboot from time to time... Like certain bigger updates. But, well, it can simply wait until you turn it off for. Well, the next time.
 however, i believe ive got the answer i was looking for. = To wait for a kernel update. So youll see me again when thats been fixed. See you
