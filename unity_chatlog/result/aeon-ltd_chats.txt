 Senix: you mean compiz? alt-f2 'metacity --replace' will kill compiz and replace with metacity as the window manager

 needlez: you might wanna try linux mint, they're kinda known for more compatibility stock than other distros
 !kde | vrln
 klingan: yes
 kusanagi: wait till you start using ground up distros, you start to hate that distros bundle anything you have to remove anyway :)
 Dan_E: is it crashing back everytime you try?
 Dan_E: firefox? using unity?
 Dan_E: not using unity?
 Dan_E: is your desktop iphone like? if not then you're probably not using unity
 Dan_E: thats probably unity, i'm using latest flash and firefox 3 - fullscreen works fine, so i assume its a firefox 4 problem (kinda thin assumption at this point) but 4.0.1 was released, so as soon as ubuntu can brand it you'll know if its flash or firefox; unless you're using compiz then i'd reccommend disabling it
 Dan_E: you can't through normal methods, you have to wait for ubuntu/canonical to brand and test then release it
 Dan_E: so you pretty much have to wait, or try other browsers to see if it works - then you'll confirm that its flash

 roasted: is it slow? use 2D, like lightning? use 3D for more bling :)
 roasted: personally i wouldn't use either, i feel that UIs like unity slow things down more
 roasted: sorry, but yeah unity's nice - in eye candy terms anyway :)
 vagvaf: /usr/share/ somewhere in there...
 vagvaf: sorry for being kind of vague, most likely though in /usr/share/gdm i'd assume
 marktuk: does it not compile with the guide in !compile

 bibleboy: pre download iso, same directory as wubi, then wubi
 bibleboy: but you will need some internet source for the iso ofcourse
 bibleboy: 512 is fine, though personally i'd use lubuntu, xubuntu or start from server for reducing all unneccessary 'weight'
 bibleboy: in the same folder as the wubi installer
 who the hell uses just vi anymore?
 if you were gonna use vi at least use vim
