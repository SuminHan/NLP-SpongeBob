 Hello! Im having issues with windowed fullscreen mode with xbmc in ubuntu, i've tried to get help through the xbmc forum but no one has replied. Here's a link with detailed information about the issue http://forum.xbmc.org/showpost.php?p=786924&postcount=3
 Anyone got a clue why i cant seem to get windowed fullscreen in xbmc? More details here: http://forum.xbmc.org/forumdisplay.php?f=52
 Omega: no this started to occur after the installation of xbmc 11.04
 Omega: it works in classic mode (2d) not in Unity mode.. Pure fullscreen works but not windowed fullscreen, its like there's a hidden border at the bottom of the screen preventing it
