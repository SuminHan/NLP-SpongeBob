 I'm looking to get the latest PHP version of software (including mod_php) for Ubtunu 8.04LTS, can someone recommend a path/action I need to take to do this?
 odinsbane, is that recommended?
 odinsbane, 8.04 is LTS, is it no longer supported?
 odinsbane, 5.3
 What is the "codename" of 8.04LTS ?
 thanks :)
 odinsbane, i'll give it a try thanks
 :)
 odinsbane, yeah - failed, lots of lib* dependecies
