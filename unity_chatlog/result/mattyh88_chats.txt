 hey, i'm trying to install apache2
 but not sure if i installed it properly
 i went to the synaptic package manager and checked 'apache' and i think i installed it, but i can't find it at /etc/apache
 how can i know for sure that apache2 is installed?
 should apache -v normally work?
 iceroot: no packages found matching apache2
 iceroot: i do have some files installed @ /usr/lib/apache2
