 Jordan_U, no
 Jordan_U, I had my /boot on another patition
 Jordan_U, no i installed the new /boot onto that patition... Was that wrong?
 sebsebseb, Yes i use Unity.. Why?
 Jordan_U, because i thought that it was the way to do it :-(
 sebsebseb, my Unity works fine
 Jordan_U: ok, do you know if i can recover my ubuntu 10.10 system?
 Jordan_U: isn't there a simpler way? With a ubuntu 10.10 live cd for example?
