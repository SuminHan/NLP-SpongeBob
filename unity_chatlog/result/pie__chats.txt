 why is there no taskbar? *crying*
 ok so i just ran the upgrader from cd after running from hdd screwed up my box
 and the gui is all screwy and im pretty clueless on using it
 can someone link me to a help doc because i dotn know how to open firefox...
 i think its unity
 im just totally disoriented
 its whatever comes with 11.04
 cheapie, to be honest i actually didnt look there :/
 i just dont know what the hell im doing
 i think it works
 because irc comes up automatically
 im just totally disoriented
 new gui, y u no come with tutorial?
 cheapie, ive managed to figure out where the file and such menus are(theyre at the top where the ..."dtart menu" was)
 but where did the bar with the "start menu" go and wheres the task bar
 (pardon my windows terms i dont know what you call those)
 and how do i get the equivalent of such menu again
 oh wow....how did i miss that?
 now i gotta figure out how the hell that works...
 looooong day :(
 to be honest i find windows/old ubuntu a lot mor intuitive but thanks ive got a launch point now
 might as well go with th enew since thats how itll be onwards, and the supports mainly going to be for th enew gui no?
 are there no tutorials for general unity usage?(ubuntu 11/04 gui)
 histo, unity homepage or ubuntu?
 thanky you!
 ok cmon innovative new concept? mac has been using dash forever :P
 what has ctrl-alt-backspace been replaced with?
 oh man this is disastrous lol
 whered taskbarthings go xD
 what textfile do i reset to fix my screwed up gui? :/
 man im totally destroying this
 theres a sh script called Xreset, or should i just delete the xorg.conf file?
 acually no xorg.conf
 >.<
 not to be naggy but...i have exams coming up and i kind of need to figure this out :/ ive never messed with xorg and i actually cant make any new windows come p other than irc because that  starts p automatically
 *up
 im logged in in the shell you get when you press ctrl+alt+f1
 rejected send message, 1 matched rulelots of stuff hat would take a long time to type
 i got it
 of all things i forgot sudo
 and i finally found where toset the layout at login
 thanks
 someting still doesnt seem right though...
 i found something quite problematic with selecting the classic layout on login,theres no window frames just thw windows
 any popups and such from firefox etc dont have minimize, exit maximize or move
 *sigh*
