 sooo
 question
 I am getting the dreaded sudo: must be setuid root
 because I AGAIN tried to chown the /usr dir
 apt-get was trying to mod a file in the dir and sudo before the command wasn't working
 so I was like "well it is telling me that I have to be the owner, even with pseudp"
 sudo
 so now I have no root abilities on sudo
 and no ownership of /usr
 everything I have seen says to reisntall
 so are you really telling me that when I get feedback from an install command that says I need to be an owner of a file, and that flag is raised ***even with sudo*** and I own the file, it cause a state where the only answer is reinstallation?
 wow
 what an epic fail
 ubuntu and linux are really cool
 but if you want it to progress beyond the parent's basement, shit has to get more intuitive than this
 so reinstall?
 really
 seriously?
