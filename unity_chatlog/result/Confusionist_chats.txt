 Hey, I'm upgrading from maverick to natty and running into a problem with the Python upgrade that turned into a blocker for finishing it. It's complaining that: "Setting up python2.7-minimal (2.7.1-5ubuntu2) ...
 Linking and byte-compiling packages for runtime python2.7...
 E: pycompile:240: Requested versions are not installed"
 There's some bugs with this issue, but they are several months old and things have been changed afterwards
 Anyone an idea what the best way to resolve this would be?
 Does anyone know what to do about Python 2.7 failing to install with: E: pycompile:240: Requested versions are not installed?
 Right, this has a solution for python 2.7, but it does involve editing some 'random' file: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1649948.html
