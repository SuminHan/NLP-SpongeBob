 I've been using Ubuntu for four years now. I'm finding this new release harder to use. You have to search for programs?
 xangua, I seen that, but you still have to search for it first. I just find it a pain
 Herbs, go to hell! I'm just saying how I feel. I've been using Ubuntu for four years now, and don't plan on changing. But I don't think it's a reason to take a step backwards
 arand, I seen that
 Herbs, this chat is probably the most helpful place. Idiots like you were never tolerated
 xangua, I seen that. I'm going to try to get used to this since it looks like it's going to be the new standard
 An op should boot Herbs, he is really annoying
 KM0201, arand, I guess it's like anything else, just going to take some getting used to. Is there anyway to add things to the panel?
 KM0201, arand, Ok, thanks for the help! I'm going to go play a little more. Ubuntu still ROCKS!!
 robin0800, thanks!
