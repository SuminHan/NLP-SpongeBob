 escott, nice, now working only with linux and all is ok,  I am trying to update my 10.10 to 11.04 but update manager ask me to insert 10.10 into a cdrom Â¿is mandatory this step?, I have 10.10 only in a flash memory, I dont burn cds never
 escott, I understand
 escott, I downloaded full iso final 11.04, is possible update from this iso?
 jo-erlend: then If i want to update, I need to download alternative iso?
 jo-erlend: I tried but update manager ask me for cd rom of 10.10 version, i have this iso on my usb device, is mandarory insert 10.10 cdrom?
 jo-erlend: I am not sure what do you mean with "archive settings", and yes I have ubuntu 10.10 as single OS on my lap, no partitions, no dual boot, no windows
 jo-erlend: Done, I found where software sources option is, is within update manager under settings button,  thanks!
