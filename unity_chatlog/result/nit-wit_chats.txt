 elsoja, you can use gparted but the W7 disk manager is suggested
 elsoja, boot a live Ubuntu cd and follow the next pastebin to install lilo it will boot XP.

 perlsyntax, says additional drivers in mine
 perlsyntax, yeah yours sounded familiar.:)
 perlsyntax, what OS are you running?
 perlsyntax, did you find additional drivers?
 perlsyntax, additional drivers would tell you if one is found to be available for install
 perlsyntax, yes and it starts with you actually reading what I have asked and answering it.:)
 Belinrahs, link
 perlsyntax, well read it again it is a question?
 perlsyntax, I dont have natty open right now but in the panel is a squarq with a + sign click it and search
 Belinrahs, I looked I can't really tell what might be causing a freeze up sorry.
 Kevin147, http://pastebin.com/y1gnRdQm let us know if you get in
 Kevin147, #1 is the header the decription # is the start of the commands
 Kevin147, start at #2
 Kevin147, you can do it when you hit tab it is to complete so if you hit the tab where stated and nothing comes up start again, you don't have to reboot to try again.
 Kevin147, the first line #2 has to be with the correct partition. Also the spaces a critical as well.;)
 *are
 truepurple, tried ir did upgrade
 *or
 truepurple, to be honest the description is confusing. The update upgrade should happen with not turning the computer off. Is the a failed upgrade, so you thought your computer was okay then restarted to the situation now?
 truepurple, yes if you had a good upgrade. the way you have described it is confusingto me at least.:)
 truepurple, cool
 Kevin147, X=partitionumber
 Kevin147, the partition if looked at with gparted would look something like the sda1  the 1 is the X boot a live cd and open gparted and write down the partition. This can be found from thegrub> but I don't know the command
 Kevin147, are you in natty
 Kevin147, If your in Natty run sudo grub-install /dev/sda then sudo update grub make sure the hd is sda
 Kevin147, yeah if your getting them from the first tab
 Kevin147, so after the kernel line 3 correctly spaced root=/dev/sda1
 Kevin147, is Ubuntu the only OS?
 Kevin147, did you type the kernel or use the tab
 Kevin147, okay so use the 1 in place of both X's in the commands then start from the beginning of the command set and use the tab complete as notated
 Kevin147, here ios a reload of grub2 from a live cd as well.
 Kevin147, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling%20GRUB%202
 truepurple, thanks I will look
 Kevin147, do you know the graphic card
 Kevin147, yeah just boot a live cd and follow that grub link that should get you in, otherwise there is a bootscript that is quite helpful that can be run from a lve cd then put in a pastebin for us to look at.
 Kevin147, bootscript http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
 Kevin147, cool the tux angles have answered.;)
 trucMuche, I'm typing
 truepurple, I'm typing sorry trucMuche
 truepurple, good luck I hope hyou get to the bottom of it I see to many ouliers to really tell what is up
 plustax, if you have partition space  no
 plustax, what is installed now
 plustax, do you know the partition amount limitations on a single HD
 Kevin147, I thought it was my walnut sized brain.;)
 Artarian, roll back is not a go
 Artarian, do whst?
 Artarian, you have to do a fresh install
 Artarian, that is why you should clone the setup before you mw=ess with upgrading
 ny51bern, that is the menu from the recovery
 ny51bern, I was trying ti find what the problem is can you tell me again
 ny51bern, have you tried alow graphics boot in
 ny51bern, have you installed graphics drivers in the past?
 ny51bern, at the grub menu hit e then use the keyboard arrows to navigate ti the splash at the end of the kernel line and replace it with nomodeset the crtlx to boot to a command line boot in then hit startx
 haroon, I think you have to assign the keys but alt f2 is a system setup
 ny51bern, the word splash
 ny51bern, that is the ticket.:)
 haroon, I haven't spent anytime doing key assignments I know no more then you.
 ny51bern, ah the change your doing is not permanent a per session
 ny51bern, crtl-x is the command to boot from there to a command to login then run startx to start the desktop
 ny51bern, so crtl-x boots from your edit to a command line. there you boot in, the startx starts the desktop from there.
 ny51bern, you just type it then het enter
 ny51bern, did you login
 ny51bern, okay it is hit the crtl key hold it down and tap the x
 ny51bern, when you do the boot this way all you should see is text until the command line did you remove the word splash insert nomodeset leaving the space in front and after then hold down the crtl key then tap x
 ny51bern, it sounded to me that you tried to hit crtlx all at the same time they are run the way I described
 ny51bern, hold down crtl-alt-prtsc the slosly typr reisub
 ny51bern, that is a soft reboot if it does not work just power off it is linux that is not a big deal.
 ny51bern, no hold down the 3 keys the reisub about a sec between each one and it may do a soft reboot
 ny51bern, is this a fresh install or a upgrade and are there any other OS's on the computer
 yeah
 ny51bern, power button is fine
 ny51bern, are you a ubuntu forums member
 ny51bern, I know the IRC seems more efficient but at times it isn't always. I would a join there and post at least to have a few irons in the fire beyond this I am not sure where to go.
 no prblem
 linuasus6, can you paste bin the output from sudo fdisk -lu
 linuasus6, which partition is the install you want to have the boot
 linuasus6, cool here is a link to a grub reload from a live cd it is grub2.https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling%20GRUB%202
 linuasus6, is the sdc a external
 linuasus6, cool jus load it as the two commands show and the second command to the sdc mbr does this make sense
 linuasus6, use the same cd of the insta and  In the terminal sudo mount /dev/sdc5 /mnt  then  sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdc
 linuasus6, *install
 linuasus6, copy and paste bro
 linuasus6, make sure the sdc drive is the first read in the bios, unless it is a external and you know the key propmt boot
 linuasus6, I gave two commands look closer
 linuasus6, first command sudo mount /dev/sdc5 /mnt
 linuasus6, then run the next one you ran reboot to the OS and run sudo update-grub
 linuasus6, http://pastebin.com/69bWgwsW
 linuasus6, you ran the commands backwards just reboot and follow my last pastebin if this does not work post the bootscript in a pastebin.http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
 linuasus6, Actualy my pastbin is inncorrect the x in the second command should be a c I wil do it again hold on
 linuasus6, sorry about that, http://pastebin.com/h3ufspVU
 greenlantern, what desktop do you want
 linuasus6, I have never seen that error open gparted and look at the partitions
 linuasus6, post it if you can treally the bootscript is what I need
 linuasus6, if it is a external yeah reboot I have to be off for about 5-10 min
 zoidfarb, take a look at this and the playing round section in the lower left. http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purexfce
 *around
 dtulchin, what happend when hyou boot can you get a command line
 linuasus6, cool
 linuasus6, run this script and pastebin it.
 linuasus6, darn mouse http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/
 dtulchin, how do you know this you didn't answer my actual question
 dtulchin, cool can you actually boot in?
 dtulchin, so are you sure it actually started to load the upgrade and didn't fail at the download
 linuasus6, the bootscript is run to generate a text file to pastebin
 dtulchin, cool I was just going to give you a command to inlock t and finish hopefully.;)
 *unlock
 linuasus6, yeah download the script on the live cd drag it to the desktop and run this command.sudo bash ~/Desktop/boot_info_script*.sh
 linuasus6, opps this command sudo bash ~/Desktop/boot_info_script*.sh
 dtulchin, I thought it was fixed
 dtulchin, there is no real repair for a whole system, you may need to just back it up or use the UBuntu Forums to be honest I wont really touch it to many outlires
 linuasus6, cool hold on
 dtulchin, reload or wait for help that may not appear the IRC is sort of specialized for specifics, the forums may be motr helpful
 linuasus6, I don't see the OS in sdc5 but the grub menu is there I am not sure what is going on, you may want to opost the script at the Ubuntu forums if you get no answers here.
 linuasus6, why are you using a boot partition
 linuasus6, I'm not familiar with boot partitions, but in the partition has to be the grub files normally in the OS, basically.
 linuasus6, no but it is hard to tell what is actually there a lot is missing, you will really be best served at the Ubuntu forums.
 linuasus6, take a lok at my set up you will see what  mean. http://pastebin.com/XaJeWzgr
 linuasus6, you mean the sda6 burg
 linuasus6, not sure I understand sda5 is xubuntu natty sda9 in oneiric
 linuasus6, brb
 linuasus6, I have a arch install that has grub legacy but chainloadda with grub2 automatically.

 chille, conky
 a smattering of applause for conky
 conky uses the lowest system resources
 crowsnest, how are you formatting
 crowsnest, I would use gparted it is easier, at least for me
 chille, there are scripts all over the web to have it looking pretty cool
