 so is there any way to get the menu to open in gnome2 by issuing a command?
 pattysmatty, or 192.168.0.1
 Stereocaulon, last 3 routers I've had have been .0.1
 jibadeeha, I quite like gnome2 menu
 Simkin, agreed
 I don't like navigating my apps in such a way no
 I really like gnome3's indicator
 I think the unity launcher should be movable and not always extend
 Stereocaulon, yeah, depends on model.
 Simkin, I leep trying to like kde 4.6, but it's just too messy, configurations are all over the place
 TheBritishEditor, did you try installing the driver from the repos?
 bencc, overwrite it?
 TheBritishEditor, by break what do you mean, what exactly happens?
 bencc, maybe nginx has a lock on it?  I'm not that familiar with it
 bencc, try switching to root
 s3r3n1t7, or sudo su ?
 s3r3n1t7, so what does sudo su do then?  I've used that to switch to root before
 s3r3n1t7, good to know
 zvacet, cheers ;)
 when would one want to use sudo su then?
 jrib, why is it available then?
 jrib, why not remove it as an option?
 jrib, i mean why does it do anything, there is obviously a reason for it
 yeah, fair enough, just curious
 Chipzzz, well we kind of arrived here, so now I'm curious
 jrib, yeah that has been advised
 iceroot, I've seen tutorials from years ago that recommended using sudo su
 iceroot, those tutorials were probably wrong
 i've seen lots of tutorials use sudo gedit instead of gksudo gedit too
 iceroot, lol
 iceroot, no emacs
 cheapie, yeah, I use nano when staying within the confines of a terminal
 iceroot, yeah, I know that much, I mean to learn why it is wrong
 zvacet has psoted a link for me
 so, anyone know how to open gnome2 menu via a single command?
 what command shows main menu in gnome2?
 trentg, terminal command ;)
