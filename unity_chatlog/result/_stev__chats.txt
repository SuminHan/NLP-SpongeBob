 hi, I'm installing natty and I have a problem with grub2 and lvm
 it is an encrypted disk and grub2 can't probe a disk for my lvm root partition
 error is: Autodetection of a filesystem of "/dev/mapper/my-lvm-root-partition" failed
 ok, if anyone cares grub2 has a problem with lvm volumes with dashes, anyone knows how I can rename an lvm logical volume?
