 well
 how to know which OS I am using exactly ?
 uname -a doesn't tell me really :P
 it's not ubuntu, so says command not found
 not sure where to ask, well will move on to #linux then :)
 thanks anyway
 -bash: lsb_release: command not found
 lsb_release and uname are the first things I try :)
 cat /etc/issue Dr_Willis|2 :)
 centos 5.5
 how do you empty a file from the terminal ?
 no just clear content
 $ > filename worked, but not sure why/how :/
