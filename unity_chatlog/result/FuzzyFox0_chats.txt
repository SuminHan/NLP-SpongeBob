 hey all
 I am looking for a command to list all printers on the network with their IP addresses
 anyone? list all networked printers?
 shcherbak: can it distinguish if port 9100 is open?
 shcherbak: any thing more specific? Im not the most tech user however I can get my head round most things
 defswork: some show but not all
 defswork: most of the printers here use IPP so I need their ips :P
