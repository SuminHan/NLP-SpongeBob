 Looking for some assistance.  Just installed Ubuntu 11.04 32-bit version.  No errors.  When I restarted I was presented with the Grub2 shell.  Rebooted with the install CD and dropped to a shell on the root partition just installed on.  Removed grub-pc and grub-common.  Then installed grub-pc and grub-common.  Installed Grub without errors.  Rebooted and am still getting the Grub2 shell.  Anyone can help as to why it's not bo

 m0ksha: I do not have raid setup.  Just IDE
 Single drive and only ubuntu on it
