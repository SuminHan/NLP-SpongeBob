 i have a problem with acerhdf. after installation, as i attempt "modprobe acerhdf", i get "fatal: error inserting acerhdf". does anyone here know why such a problem would occur?
 acicula: have attempted "sudo modprobe", as well as "sudo su", then modprobe - no luck!
 acicula: i still get "FATAL: Error inserting acerhdf (/lib/modules/2.6.35-28-generic/updates/acerhdf.ko): Invalid argument"
 acicula: will check!
 acicula: with verbose flag [sudo modprobe acerhdf -v]: "insmod /lib/modules/2.6.35-28-generic/updates/acerhdf.ko
 FATAL: Error inserting acerhdf (/lib/modules/2.6.35-28-generic/updates/acerhdf.ko): Invalid argument"
 escott: thanks! will check that link out.
 acicula: i'm not sure. isn't it just: "insmod /lib/modules/2.6.35-28-generic/updates/acerhdf.ko"
 acicula: have tried that already, unfortunatly!
 acicula: acicula: thanks for the percistancy! i suck at all this advanced stuff, but i simply have followed these instructions: "http://crunchbanglinux.org/wiki/howto/aspireone", regarding the section 'fan control'. will check dmesg now!
 acicula: oh, and that link says it's loadable, yes!
 acicula: no, not at all! not on purpose, at least. eventhough i have modified the system some - due to a lot of bugs with ubuntu on acer aspire one! but anyways:
 acicula: [    0.000000] ACPI: SLIC 7f6bbe8a 00176 (v01 ACRSYS ACRPRDCT 06040000 acer 00000000)

 acicula: it does, yes! thanks for all the help!
 acicula: and have a nice evening or day! bye!
