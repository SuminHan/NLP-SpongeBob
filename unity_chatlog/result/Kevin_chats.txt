 Soothsayer: pong
 Soothsayer: why would it end up being sda1? I would expect the windows c: partition to be sda1
 Soothsayer: nor should you specifically change the numbers around (you'll confuse windows)
 n3glv: probably need to give them a link to a 'how to ask good questions' page
 klunky999: you want to fix grub after installing windows second?
 klunky999: what's the entry for windows?
 klunky999: pastebin it since it's probably a few lines
 klunky999: /boot/grub/grub.cfg, or is it .conf
 klunky999: oh, and did you delete a small useless looking windows boot partition when you installed ubuntu?
 [snake]: normally yes, but files are named what they are named, it could be.. interesting
 klunky999: show the output of fdisk -l
 klunky999: actually there seems to be a bug there, or someone changed it, since it doesn't have the partition numbers..
 klunky999: oh right, nevermind
 klunky999: fdisk -l
 klunky999: as root, or with sudo
 klunky999: looks like that entry should work, since it's what the mbr would normally do
 klunky999: I don't suppose you can run the two commands in the file in grub and say what it gives back
 klunky999: that's why I want you to type it in, so it doesn't return
 klunky999: although it would normally show something anyway, you might me missing it
 klunky999: press c, then enter the lines it shows for windows starting at insmod. you don't need to enter the uuid one if you don't want, since it's annoying
 klunky999: normally i'd do that in kvm so you can get a screenshot, but that's not easy to explain
 klunky999: yes when at the grub menu
