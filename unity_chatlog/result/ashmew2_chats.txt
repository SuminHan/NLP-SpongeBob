 NetM: np :)
 jrib: you must be keeping that statement on ur clipboard lol :P
 curt: well tbh ive never upgraded myself..but im guna do that this time from 10.10 to 11.04.....sometimes breakage occurs if you have outdated hardware i think...and maybe because the things that you had like a library 2.1 , in the new repo, it may be a library 3.0...its worth the try imo..you can always do a fresh install after that
 sorry long msg
 :)
