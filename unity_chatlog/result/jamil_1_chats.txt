 Hello ppl, I am having trouble with mouse click. Mouse click seems to drag the window...
 I have unity....
 Hello ppl, mouse is not working the way it should. Left Click seems to drag the windows. Right click any where in an application doesnt show the application specific menu rather the generic move/close menu
 ppl help me!
 mouse is not working the way it should. Left Click seems to drag the windows. Right click anywhere in an application doesnt show the application specific menu rather the generic move/close menu
 Why do I get this error: error in Version string '4:SVN-r25793-1': version number does not start with digit
 Help! I have to keep pressing alt key to perform normal left-click operations....I am on recently upgraded 11.04 system...
 I just reset settings in CCSM and apparently every thing is gone...no top bar, not side bar ....as if unity has crashed...
 HHow can I start unity manually ?
 usalabs: I did type unity in terminal. Something flashed on screen and nothing happened...
 When I login into ubuntu/unity I neither see the top bar nor the sidebar. But I know that unity is running because it show it in ps
