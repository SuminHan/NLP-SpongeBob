 i just installed ubuntu 11.04, and i see that nvidia drivers are installed but the additional drivers page says that no proprietary drivers are in use on this system.
 victorhugo289, hi
 "this driver is activated but not currently in use"... how do i make ubuntu use the nvidia driver?
 w30, yeah it shows a green icon. confusingly enough, unity works when ubuntu claims the driver isnt in use (ugh)
 is there like a 3d test i can run to really see if the driver is actually being used?
 w30, idk... it defaulted for me.
