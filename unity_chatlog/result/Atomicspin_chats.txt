 Does anyone know of an issue where the backlight on a laptop screen won't come on?
 Is there a fix?
 drAg:  I don't see that option in there.
 drAg:  There's nothing referring to it.
 msg drAg Still don't see it in Power Management.  On Natty btw.
 That's what I get for using BitchX
 taglass:  Can you send the link one more time?  lost it.
 Wireless was working fine in 10.10, now it's not in 11.04
 I have the STA drivers installed.
