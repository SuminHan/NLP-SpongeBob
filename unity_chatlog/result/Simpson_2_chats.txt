 will upgrading to 11.04 always replace my gnome2 desktop ?
 is there a way to default it back to gnome2 ?
 my parents around 70 won't survive such a dramatic switch so I would like to have the gnome2 as default for them
 BlouBlou, okay, thats all i need to now
 i do presume the old desktop is preserved ?
 okay thx for the answer guys
