 the hid_cando touchscreen driver does not seem to survive suspend. dmesg tells the usb device was disconnected. the other usb devices are just fine...
 any ideas what i could do about _one_ usb device disappearing ("usb x-y: USB disconnect") after suspend? doesn't seem to matter whether the driver module is loaded while suspending or not..
