 I need some help I just installed ubuntu 11.04 desktop, it's not booting
 has anyone had any problems with booting into ubuntu 11.04 after install?
 yes it wasn't loading, would start to load (ie the purple screen) then would go to a black screen and nothing, I could type anything I wanted and it wouldn't do anything, I shoved the disk back in to boot to live to double check that it works on my system and loaded in with out a problem I am now running the install again
 maybe something went cookoo while installing
 will try that if it happens again thanks
