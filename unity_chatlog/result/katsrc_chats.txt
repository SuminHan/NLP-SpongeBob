 hey, can someone recommend me a good PPA for GIMP 2.7.2?
 hey everyone
 i'm trying out the Nouveau drivers but can't seem to set a correct resolution
 it's only using 1024x768
 Logan_: thanks
 trying to compile and getting this error: "configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables" anyone have an idea what it could be?
 hey all
 do i have to specify: export CFLAGS=“-march=native” in order to get 64bit builds?
 or is there a configuration some where that already does that?
 why do we need firefox globalmenu?
 every time i build GIMP i get a segfault when i try to launch it , anyone know what could be causing this?
 botcity: compile it from source
 botcity: even the PPA's cause segfault
 i'm using Matt Walker's PPA: https://launchpad.net/~matthaeus123/+archive/mrw-gimp-svn
