 my ftp user is able to see back into my file structure tree.. i only want them to see there own folder.. where is this set?

 kill3: its something i would try, if you believe there are no other issues
 kill3: also try on other comps maybe just to make sure the usb is fine
 ikonia: the ftp access jumps to folder i want, but i can still back up thru the structure tree
 must have used it wrong.. googleing
 Are the users made by Ubunt not SSH by default.. im havin trouble finding chroot info.. foujnd chrot for sftp users ssh users ftps users...
 and what is the JailKit?
 ikonia: is this what im looking for? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicChroot
 so im looking up information on chroot options so that my ftp users cannot access anything above there home directory. is the chroot a setting in ubuntu already? or must i install/configure something new?
 herbs: where do i find the ftp server configuration?
 herbs ssh
 yes
 sorry learning as i go
 Herbs: so far when i log in with ftp, i can see the entire file structure tree above the home directory i have set
 Herbs: ok.... well im using filezilla and it says sftp:// at beginning... does this mean i cannot set this?
 Herbs: so i should look for setting in the ssh to set the root folder.. is that the right term? root folder?
 Herbs: sorry im trying to keep up. so should i bee looking in my etc/ssh for a file to set the configuration?
 Herbs: iv used the user/groups to make a user with a certain home directory in there own group.
 Herbs: but when i access via sftp i can see everything above
 Herbs:im using the user name i made, not the word root
 Herbs: so all my usernames login as root?
 Herbs: sub user with my actuall user naem right?
 hplip:x:112:7:HPLIP system user,,,:/var/run/hplip:/bin/false
 user2:x:1002:1002:user2,,,:var/www/user2/:bin/bash
 user2:x:1002:1002:user2,,,:var/www/user2/:bin/bash
 lol
 Herbs: bash: echo/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games: No such file or directory
 Herb: might i have to restart anything if i made this home directory change? could that be it?
 Herbs: and i cant go up in directory there
 Herbs: i went to user groups and set the home directory to /var/www/user2
 Herbs: how can i see if ftp is installed on my Ubuntu?
 ftp is currently not installed
 Herbs: i just connected via filezilla and i can see everything
 Herbs: my filezilla starts with sftp://user2@...... and ftp said not isntalled
 Herbs: and setting type is SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol
 Herbs: i can adjust those with the tool in Ubuntu right? the User Groups?
 Herbs: so i cant use the Ubuntu tool. i need to do in terminal?
 Herbs: the  System, > Administration > Users and Groups
 ah kk
 Herbs: is this towarsds what i need? http://www.howtoforge.com/chrooted-ssh-sftp-tutorial-debian-lenny
 if i have a sftp users and im trying to give them one folder to upload to, is that what im reading is jailing?
 from https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/packagingguide/C/appendix-chroot.html did sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd edgy /var/chroot/ http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ and got Failed getting relase file http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/Release
 so if i had version 10 and did sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd lucid/var/chroot/ http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/     and now im getting lots of retrieving and validating things.. did it just upgrade to 11?
 How would I make sure that my sftp users can only access there home directory?
 ActionParsnip: they can only manipulate files in there home directory as is, but they can see the entire file structure on computer
 restrict SFTP to a user's home directory do i need a chroot enviroment, or can it be down with permissions?
