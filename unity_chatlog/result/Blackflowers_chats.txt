 Hi, I am looking for user input, I have been using fedora linux the last couple of days and have had nothing but lock-ups have to manually go out and reset the computer and nobody seems to be able to help me, I am curious is ubuntu support more reliable? I've got a computer that I have been trying to get setup for weeks now. Althought it does have some additional hardware which may not be supported by linux.
 It freezes up, typically under wine that I noticed but then it froze up under gkrellm, a friend said that it could be video related.
 Windows 7
 no, its got a 2+ week uptime going right now.
 I haven't been able to get any support so I've spent the last day reading up on Ubuntu/Kubuntu. Basically this computer sits in another room, I VNC into it. I use it for storage mainly.
 chrisbster : It had onboard video ati 4200 hd
 shcherbak its not really a nessecity but i figure it would be nice to have.
 when it comes to linux I am and have always been a noob.
 Ok
 chrisbster well Fedora wasn't my choice I let someone talk me into it and they promised they would help and now I just want to choke them, Ubuntu was my original but like always I let someone convince me what to run.
 I'm new to all of this linux and I have a decent machine built for it. I have planned on doing a Ubuntu install I want to keep it simple. It feels like I've been dropped on my head with Fedora.
 wn1zid so far i've gotten more help here since i've joined the channel than in the past 4 days of asking around everywhere else.
 I almost had the machine pulled apart and was looking to see if the mainboard was bad.
 Sounds like the best plan.
 Should i install 11.04 or a earlier version, this machine has 8gb ram and if i remember 32bit has PAE which works fine right?
 amd x6 1090t black edition, 8gb ddr-1333, onboard ati 4200. and 8x2tb drives. 1x 1tb drive (boot)
 Okay. I was under the impression that their wasn't much for x64 support. Time to get some coffee in me and get this started. :)
