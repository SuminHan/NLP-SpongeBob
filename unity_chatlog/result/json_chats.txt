 What is the command to change the permissions (owner, group and execute as program) of a file from 'root' to my account ?
 celthunder, just chown and chmod ? Nothing else ?
 celthunder, Yes, but no other args ? As in just, $ chown <file> will do it for me ?
 celthunder, Thanks ! And to execute the file as program, giving read/write privileges as well  ?
 celthunder, Thank you !
 celthunder, Yup, I needed that, too ! It's only me... !
 celthunder, Is there a book where you get your info from ? I mean, besides, the man pages... ?
 celthunder, man pages, then for me !
 Starminn, Yes, shcherbak just pointed one to me.. !
 shcherbak, Thanks ! I'll look it up... Who know ? I'll come back later and help you !!
 celthunder, yes, thank you, thank you !
