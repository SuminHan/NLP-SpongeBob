 hi ... i have a question... will upgrading my distro via the update manager remove my files in /usr and my installations of apache, django, etc
 jnlsnl_, thats apache running as www-data, but apache tuns php, so, yes
 php runs as www-data
 Will my data be affected by upgrading ubuntu
 JUST ONE QUESTION , WILL I LOSE MY /usr DATA ON UPGRADING UBUNTU TO 11.04
 LjL, thanx, but really needed to know that, and the traffic here is mind-boggling
