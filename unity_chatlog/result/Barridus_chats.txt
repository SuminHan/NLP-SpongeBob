 ok quick question guys :)  is desktop wallpaper like gone?
 oy, where does evolution keep it's data now?  i don't see ~/.evolution/ in natty
 umm, can compiz/compositing be turned off in unity?
 i guess nobody knows how to disable compiz/compositing in natty?
 ForceDestroyer, compiz is the nifty graphics effects
 i see a package called unity-2d, which appears to be an alternate unity without acceleration
 is gwibber nonfunctional?  i can't get any tweets
 eltigre, click on the "shut down" icon in the upper right, system settings is in there now for some reason
 (not a trick i promise XD)
 does gwibber... uh... work?
 zzecool, yeah but i just wanted to see if gwibber worked.  i'm getting no tweets so i guess not?
 tasslehoff, evolution handles gmail
 and thunderbird
 it's not possible to have the current weather in the clock area/top toolbar anymore?
 can gwibber be set to update more often than 5 minutes by editing some config file?
 cron for gwibber?
 DasEi, yeah but it only goes down to 5, that's kind of an uneccesary limitation since the twitter API no longer gets crapped out if you do it too frequently.   most modern twitter clients allow very fast auto refreshes
 DasEi, i was talking gwibber
 i actually like how it works now, except that refresh limitation
 yeah me neither DasEi
 DasEi, actually it's in gconf-editor.  didn't think of that before.  i'll see if this works
 brb
