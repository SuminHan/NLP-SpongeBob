 in natty, when I enable dual screen, my system becomes nearly unresponsive.  I have an nvidia 8800... should be fine
 looks like it installed the wrong driver by default
 manday, no
 mah454: what's wrong with it?
 it's working fine for me
 vooze: just run your updates
 Bluebill-Wolf: defragging is for stuff like ntfs and what not, not needed in ext4 and such
 vooze, apt-get update first
 mikebot: it's a way of virtualizing other operating systems
 it works quite well
 skabja: similar thing here... I think the servers are a bit overwhelmed
 so how can I change the shortcuts found in the dash on unity?
 a friend of mine just installed 11.04 and it wondering how to clear recent documents... i've figured out how to do it it in most places, but totem doesn't seem to store it in recently-used and i'm not finding any where to clear it since there is no places menu anymore
 any ideas?
