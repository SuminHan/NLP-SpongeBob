 hello
 I just installed 11.04.... is there a reason why it takes 2 mins and 5 seconds to boot? I never had any problems with 10.10
 Yhea i but going from 20 sec boot to 2 min boot is alot of bloat
 yes just for 11.04
 i just timed it twice
 in a row
 what can i do to show what it is doing?
 pfifo it sits at a redish screen is there a way to show what modules are loading during the entire boot process
 f4
 ?
 pfifo f4
 ok
 thanks pfifo
 Ill be back in a few
 hum
 now why whould it take that long two times in a row but the third time it boots under 20 seconds....
 any ways thanks guys
 also right before i just did the last reboot everything way laggy
 now its smooth
 what are the thoughts on the unity?
 my cuz just went back to 10.10
 mikinanuq I am trying hard to like it
 mikinanuq: Wow thanks did not know they made use of the super key.
 Why is it called the super key it should be called the gimp key
 i think i just hate the bar being on the left side of the screen I use to hate when people would set their windows task bar to the left and this is what that reminds me of
 has any one tried gnome 3 yet?
 I am really really trying to like unity but I think unless big changes are made it might fail
 spikebike I know I just hope it comes together I really want to like this
 spikebike i think my biggest thing is trying to keep track of running windows
 Spikebike, yes but it kinda gets in the way when you have 1 app running then 3 instances of term running and all the terms come up at once things get mixed up
 spikebike but i guess its just still young they will probably have things worked out by 11.10
 All i have to say is unity looks and works alot better than stock gnome shell
 I hate mac
 but the new ipad isnot bad
 I dont think they have launcher yet
