 hello all, I just updated to 11.04 and it booted up and got to the login screen, but when I log in it just shows the purple swirl wallpaper and sits there and compiz is reporting 99% cpu time on top
 i rebooted, same thing again
 any idea what might be wrong?
 ugh I just logged in as Ubuntu Classic
 worrying because I was hoping to switch to Unity
 but I guess not :(
 but at least it works
 stefg: I've upgraded on other computers (ok all virtual machines) and it just tells me as such and boots into classic. idefk what's going on here
 virtualbox works with unity but you have to install some beta guest tools (or get them through apt) and enable 3d accelration
 though when im running vbox i'm running it in windows, no idea about a linux host
 stefg: of course its not complete but it works enough to run unity usually. though now im installing it on actual hardware it's broken. grr
 stefg: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation G98 [GeForce 8400 GS] (rev a1)
 stefg: nvidia-current is already the newest version.
 :3
 even with apt-get update
 stefg: it's there
 stefg: it comes up, and I used it to configure it in the past
 stefg: this is mx xorg.conf http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1217647 and this shows up when i run the tool, though it works fine http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1217648
 stefg: after I did that things are behaving strangely
 no window borders, I can't interact with most things though some mouse drags change into an icon?
 it's weird
 stefg: could very well be the case, I do have two screens
 stefg: I just rebooted lol
 but yeah I bet that it is dual monitors
 I would love it if they spent an entire release cycle getting more than one monitor to work properly because it is 2011 :V
