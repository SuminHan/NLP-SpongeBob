 why does Processes in System Monitor always show everything as 'sleeping'?
 ayecee,  but on my windows taskbar it always show a whole bunch of stuff active
 ayecee a whole bunch of .exe things and other things i cant recall. usually it shows at least 30 - 40 things active
 ayecee, but i'm using xchat right now so why does processes say xchat is sleeping too?
 ayecee, well when i'm on windows and i'm using mirc it always shows mirc.exe as active
 ayecee, ok i guess i am, but if i remember correct, on the windows side, its also called 'processes' so thats confusing
 ayecee ok i will
 ayecee, but at least now i know nothings wrong with my system so thanks for the info
 geekyogi,  me too
 geekyogi, me too lol
 geekyogi, i just installed it not long ago, havent noticed that its slower
 geekyogi, surprised to hear that because i read 11.04 was going to be lighter

 hello how do i save changes in crontab?
 jrib, i edited it in the terminal
 LjL, i'm not sure if its user or global
 LjL, i typed a command to schedule a task
 DamienCassou says $ crontab -e, won't that work?
 DamienCassou, thanks i'll try it
 ok i typed 'crontab -e'. it just takes me to the editing part which is where i was. i wanted to know how to save the changes
 pici oh ok i was reading info where that said if i just exit no changes will be made...maybe that's different
 Pici, so i cant do it in the terminal?
 Pici,  sorry when you said i need to save without my editor i thought maybe that mean the terminal
 LjL, thanks, ctrl + x worked
 gnu ddrescue manual says 'never try to rescue a r/w mounted partition'. how do i know if a partition is r/w so i can avoid this?
 guntbert, thanks. so what do i do if i have a r/w mount partition i want to resuce?
 guntbert, what if i wanted to recover partition or data?
 guntbert, i need to recover data from hard drives so i've been reading up on the subject and i just wanted to make sure i dont try to rescue a r/w mount since the manual says not to do this, and to know what to do if what i want to recover happens to be r/w mount
 guntbert,  i see. i was wondering if r/w mount is a thing i can change so its no longer r/w mount so i can then try to rescue it...anyways i didnt know its best to do this from live cd...i read that the important thing is to first copy image of the disc to another disc
 guntbert, thanks for the info
