 hey anyone here running a wubi-installed copy of ubuntu???
 ok, i run a XP and linux dual boot...NEITHER XP NOR UBUNTU CAN KEEP TRACK OF TIME NOW...THE CLOCK SHOWS INCORRECT TIME ALWAYS!!!
 @jrib: after rebooting of course
 u mean its a battery problem?
 i strongly doubt dat this is a CMOS battery issue guys...coz the problem has arised only after installing ubuntu using Wubi
 yeah? so why is this problem resolved if i uninstall ubuntu and run ONLY windows?
 help anyone?
 !ubotto thanks i didnt know this
 !jrib wanna help?
 jrib: sry ur last wues got lost in the group...and no there is no problem when i boot windows, shut down, and boot windows again
 jrib: tx, checking ur link out...
 jrib: ur solution didnt quite work :(
 jrib: the link told me to set my clock to 'local time' if its on 'ust' time, but its ALREADY set to 'local time'
 jrib: what other option?
 jrib: exactly what i tried to do, but ubuntu says i dont have permission to make changes in the file
 jrub: done! but ill be able to check if it worked the next time i boot, thnkx anyways man, tx a lot!
