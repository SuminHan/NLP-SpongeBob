 hello. i'm upgrading my ubuntu and at one point it's prompting to choose whether to keep the current menu.lst or install a new one?
 what should i do?
 i've previously modified that file because i have a dual boot system
 osse, i don't remember how i've modified it. the other OS is Windows XP
 osse, ok, thanks. i'll do that
 9.04 to 9.10
 osse, ^^
 osse, i already went ahead with the installation, if that's what you mean by "too late"
 osse, ok. another question: the installer is telling me that postgres 8.3 is obsolete but still installed and that i should install the latest packages. should i do that now or wait until the upgrading process finishes?
 osse, it's okay. i imagine it's not that hard to edit menu.lst again
 osse, ok. i've moving forward
 s/'ve/'m/
 osse, well, my computer is pretty old. would a version newer than 9.10 work okay?
 osse, i have a 2600 athlon cpu and 512 ram, iirc
 osse, ah. ok. i think i'll wait though because this upgrade took about 2 hours, and i don't have the patience to wait more
 hello. im using ubuntu 9.10 and, for some reason, i cant switch between languages. it worked at one point, but i cant do it anymore with the shortcut that i setup. also, the language has disappeared from my panel, and i i dont know how to bring it back. any advice?
 jrib: that might be so. i just upgraded to it.
 xangua: ^^
 jrib: i have a pretty old computer. will the newer version work properly (not crawl like a snail)?
 jrib: sempron 2600+. 512 mb ram
 jrib: hmm, ok. ill upgrade to the next version when i have the time. it takes a couple of hours which i dont have right now. thanks anyway
