 lucus thats the fsck scans the whole drive takes 2+ minutes
 jpk, was thinking that maybe resume was trying to load a stale image from the old swap partition
 jpk, but from what you said it appears that is not happening
 jpk, did you leave the old swap partition unchanged, you could write a new filesystem on top of it
 jpk, i don't buy the proposed source of the error you suggested, but if you want to be sure i would make that and ext4 partition
 mknarr, could be in use on the fs though
 ie the root
 reeceb, have you checked the v4l website
 itguru, why not just update-manager -d
 reeceb, and you have v4l installed
 reeceb install synaptic sudo apt-get synaptic, and then use it to install cheese and the v4l2 tools
 reeceb, also check the v4l website to see if your camera version is supported
 brisky83, thats a rather exotic configuration, are these ati or nvidia
 brisky83, crossfire support is not listed as supported http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature
 acicula, brisky83  ok. my connection dropped
 brisky83, i think acicula is right. i don't know if xinerama would work, but you could run two different x servers on different cards
 tripelb, there is a new font, but you shouldn't have blurry fonts have you tried adjusting your subpixel rendering options
 reeceb, its /dev/video0 but v4l does lots of nice stuff (like flipping my upside down camera the right way)
 reeceb, i would recommend using gstreamer to get the stream, or look at the v4l docs there may be bindings for popular languages
 reeceb, media framework included in gnome. what do you want to do with your camera video? and what language do you want to use?
 revButl, are you asking for suggested partition layouts or tools to partition
 revButl, how many disks do you have, how much space, what are your goals/uses for the system, how would you prioritize things like backups vs performance vs flexibility
 reeceb, see if someone has codesamples for openCV and v4l2 im sure its been done many times
 au-contrarian, 2.0 hasn't been released yet, but they really liked the features and thought it was stable enough
 revButl, i would suggest making a smaller partition ~15-20gigs for your operating system and configuring it as raid1 mirrored across the two disks with mdadm
 revButl, for the rest of the disk i would have raid1 as well, and use that for your larger files, if you outgrow the storage you can either buy more or go into a raid1 degraded mode and free a half-terabyte
 revButl, and don't forget a bit for swap space
 revButl, im sure you can get many other opinions
 !isitout | multipass
 au-contrarian, those gnu people tend to be a little picky about having all the details right with unimportant stuff like a bootloader ;)
 revButl, thats not really necessary, its a throwback from the old days of unix sysadmins when each disk was 10megs
 revButl, 90% of people have 2 (/ and swap) some add a couple more for /home or /boot
 au-contrarian, its understandable it is a bootloader and all
 au-contrarian, it could have a version number like latex which is always fun
 induz, what has changed
 induz, see if anything is using cpu in gnome-system-monitor
 KaAtta, what is that desktop widget
 Ziber, can you click on details anywhere
 KaAtta, yes the "speedometer" for cpu
 Ziber, what was the last thing it said it was doing, or is it just a progress bar?
 KaAtta, cool
 Ziber, have you already entered your username info? wondering if there is a popup somewhere behind a window
 Ziber, can you run stuff from the live cd, namely the system monitor and see if anything is happening
 netmsi, when you install proftpd it should create a user for the app, the restriction bit is part of the proftpd config, there is a gui for proftpd as well
 Ziber, did you boot the live cd to the desktop environment then start the install or did you just take the first install option
 netmsi, you could do that but there are various things you have to be aware of like, making sure the user has /dev/null as their shell and some pam stuff, better to use the suggested user
 netmsi, you can only have one service on a single port
 netmsi, so proftpd has to run as someone, and various restrictions should be put around that user, which they do by default, so that if someone does intrude into proftpd the damage they can do is minimal
 netmsi, give me a sec to confirm what i am saying is true ;)
 netmsi, so there is a distinction between a remote shell ala ssh and an service like http
 netmsi, when you ssh into a server you have an account running as your user on that server, when you http into a server you are asking an httpd program like apache to do things on your behalf, proftpd can do a bit of both, but the safer thing is to set it up like an httpd server
 netmsi, so when proftpd gets a connection request it authenticates against a list of usernames which need not be real users of the server (without a account or /home, so the only thing they can do is ftp), and then forks and processes their requests
 netmsi, if you want a service for people who have accounts on the server already consider ssh and sftp
 netmsi, its part of the proftpd config haven't done it in some time though
 netmsi, ftp is discouraged for a lot of reasons, if you can use ssh and sftp thats better
 reeceb_, np
 netmsi, virtual users i think
 Ziber, you still waiting on that install
 RedLance, if your wife and kids are the only users on the system then put your wife and you in a group say "parents" and chgrp the directory and all contents to "parents"
 RedLance, then revoke w permission from other
 netmsi, that would be for anonymous (no password login) so if thats what you want sure
 netmsi, it may be different. http://www.proftpd.org/docs/howto/VirtualUsers.html
 netmsi, the key thing is you want them to have the least priviliged access to the system, preferably nobody or guest
 netmsi, but you don't actually want to put a password on nobody or guest, and then have ftp passing that around in the clear, so I would put a password in the AuthUserFile for "nobody" and then tell them to login with that password and see if you can make that work.
 netmsi, understandable ftp is screwed up
 netmsi, if you want it to be pretty you can put a different name on the nobody UID in that AuthUserFile and then they can signin as mrrogers if that makes more sense
 netmsi, you could probably have a bunch of different aliases all to nobody's UID with their own password
 netmsi so nobody is 65534, you could have alice:65534\nbob:65534\ncharlie:65534 in your AuthUserFile (if I am understanding what I am reading correctly)
 ezl, root crontab is in /etc/cron*
 ezl, user cron files in /var/local/cron?
 nvidia
 miiike, since this froze up on battery state have you tried booting while plugged in
 !isitout
 its an asus ul*c right. does that have switchable graphics? is it a core i-series
 hiexpo, i think they spun the 210s into a mobile low power variant, its actually pretty new iirc
 miiike, you might also see if you have switchable graphics options in the bios and explicitly selecting one
 ubusammyn150, ubuntu doesn't use drive letters
 ubusammyn150, sudo apt-get install program-name-goes-here
 ubusammyn150, brainfuck is a programming language known for being very hard to understand. used more as a challenge for programmers
 ubusammyn150, you will have to explain more what you mean "reconfigure"
 !torrent | linuxdemon
 linuxdemon, we can't really help you install a program you downloaded off a torrent. we don't even know what it is
 !piracy | linuxdemon
 jeremymcs, where are you getting this problem
 ubusammyn150, have you tried virtualbox?
 ubusammyn150, and how would parallels help you exactly !xy | ubusammyn150
 lucus, no not really
 jeremymcs, its probably something in your .bashrc did you mess with that
 ubusammyn150, sorry confused you with linuxdemon
 jeremymcs, its something about the terminal client you are using. it is reporting itself as xterm-new instead of xterm, and that is causing problems in the bashrc or somewhere
 linuxdemon, try virtualbox legal, no torrents and in the apt archive
 lucus, yeah... except for the random fsck errors when you get more than 15 subvolumes, and the slowness using firefox, and the unrecoverability from errors its great!
 lucus, for a throwaway system by all means give it a go. but its not realistic for a system you will actually use
 lucus, im only running it now because im taking a break before school and have lots of spare time if it goes kapute
 lucus thats the fsck scans the whole drive takes 2+ minutes
 kaushal, no it is very very beta
 Guest31762, examine the partition table with gdisk
 z0mbyk1d, within the last 3 years or so
 z0mbyk1d, not sure when the /etc entry was introduced
 z0mbyk1d, you might consider installing etckeeper
 saml, think you are confusing with gnome3, unity does use compiz
 DaSinge, please talk to #bash overloaded by 11.04 questions here
 saml, lspci
 jubei_, do you have dnsmasq configured (NAT)
 jubei_, assuming addresses on the eth0 subnet are not valid inet addresses (192.168.* or 10.10.*) you need to use NAT dnsmasq to allow the traffic to get back to them, you could have a route out, but nothing back in
 jubei_, JuJuBee asked for a pm i think
 !pastebin | jubei_
 saml, ccsm
 victorhugo289, yes and if the installer fails to boot try the alternate
 jubei_, the tldp may have some good docs
 hinogi, ntop
 !ru | [Dmitry]1
 banished, click on the workspace switcher and drag them
 Pr070cal, gufw
 moshe_, no, there is a ppa, but it breaks lots of stuff
 banished, right click on the title bar and say move to... its still compiz so all the old gnome2 methods should work
 Pr070cal, have you tried gufw gui
 chchatzop, ubuntu classic/gnome classic from the gdm login screen
 hinogi, sorry didn't realize you meant montior MODE
 Ubuntu_user, need more information
 flo not really it still gets clocked regularly
 Ubuntu_user, so grub loads but can't chainload windows? or after a windows boot grub can't load anything
 Ubuntu_user, you need to better explain your problem i dont understand what you are saying is happening
 flo system clock is generating signals to dram at X megahertz. don't think dram knows it is empty so it always refreshes
 ie no change in energy usage with memory usage
 flo various components can be turned off/spun down. the chip can run slower the harddrives spun down, you may be able to turn off your network card etc, but not ram usage. install powertop it can optimize for battery life
 Ubuntu_user, win 7 doesn't like being messed with
 Ubuntu_user, did you shrink win7 and move the start of the partition, or just shrink it and keep the start of the partition where it was
 while, just reinstall, it should just put the newer grub on top of the old one. if you need to backup your grub.conf do that prior to the install and then you can merge you special config back in
 Ubuntu_user, i don't have any problems with the config now, but but i did have numerous assorted problems that required multiple restores of win7 and reinstalls of ubuntu
 Lars_G, pretty much, you can still create one but xorg is mostly autoconfiged these days
 usr13, all I had was a restore image, not an install disk, it would blow away the entire partition table
 Lars_G, it shouldn't ignore the file, check your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 Lars_G, try reinstalling it
 usr13, if you restore a backup image the entire disk gets restored
 Lars_G, the synaptics driver that is
 Ubuntu_user, what are your win7 reinstall options
 Ubuntu_user, well there are lots of ways Win7 can get broken. bootloader which might be fixable with the windows 7 rescue disk (you can download that). or Win7 can start thinking that there is some kind of hardware change and get stuck on PnP during boot. and a thousand other things, so I just kept reinstalling Win7 from my backup image on a USB drive until I managed to somehow not break it. took a couple attempts, but I found that wh
 ile I could safely resize the ntfs partition I could not then move it
 yxz97, looks like you are trying to run a 64bit program on a 32bit system
 yxz97, or that you have a 32bit jvm on a 64bit system. what is Azureus
 yxz97, something is 64bit did you download/install a 64bit version of Azureus or a 64bit JVM
 Ubuntu_user, grub would install over the mbr and then try to chainload the win7 loader on its partition, but that loader may have hard coded addresses for other components of the windows boot which may have moved during the resize
 Ubuntu_user, the combination of resize + replacing the windows mbr bootloader could break the win boot requiring either a win7 reinstall or the use of win7 rescue cd to fix the boot process
 econdudeawesome, uninstall Xorg and all Xlibs should remove everything else. be aware many command line tools have guis and might get pulled in
 econdudeawesome, you can just Ctrl-Alt-F1
 Ubuntu_user, doubt it the problem seems to be with win7 get the rescue cd and see if it can fix
 LAcan, iwconfig won't do it for you
 iwconfig wlan0 mode Auto
 Roasted, omgubuntu had something on that recently try googling their site
 LAcan, Ubuntu_user was having problems booting windows not ubuntu if I understand him correctly
 maximus_, your fastest setup is raid0 stripped
 maximus_, you can still strip up to the common size and have the rest for swap or large files (not that I recommend stripping)
 DexterLB, and you have installed all the fglrx drivers
 neckoox, dns only tells where the server is nothing about ports
 maximus_, mdadm documentation
 DexterLB, is the x1200 super old?
 maximus_, feel free to pm if you have mdadm questions
 maximus_, /msg
 econdudeawesome, do you mean the colors of the prompt  ($PS1 in .bashrc) or the background colors (right click on terminal and manage the profiles)
 econdudeawesome, then you need to edit your .bashrc
 LAcan, Ubuntu_user_'s problem seems to be internal to Win7. grub is chainloading and win7 boot process is busted (happens from time to time when you resize ntfs)
 Ubuntu_user_, oooh thats different you mean you can boot Win7 but then you have no bootloader afterwards?
 econdudeawesome, google for bash color prompt
 Ubuntu_user_, you have two disks yes? windows on sda and ubuntu on sdb. did you know where grub was installed? sda or sdb?
 econdudeawesome, unless you want a non-black framebuffer background... and I have no idea how that is done
 Ubuntu_user_, you mean you have 1 drive and two partitions
 H4VK1, unclear what you mean. gksudo doesn't work?
 !help | NOC
 The-Kernel_, ehhhh not really. if they are adjacent you could boot the live cd and shrink/move/grow partitions as needed
 The-Kernel_, but its really time-consuming
 NOC, install smtp-server
 GuataPeluda, no, do a reinstall
 Ubuntu_user_, give the windows rescue cd a try
 echo2, please watch the language
 echo2, make sure you have installed any available guest additions
 mang0, broadcom often takes some post install config best to work from ethernet, can you describe your mounting problem better
 H4VK1, what are you trying to accomplish?
 Ubuntu_user_, huh? do you mean wubi. are you trying to install from within a virtual machine?
 H4VK1, gksudo will run as root, gksu -u username will ask for that users username
 H4VK1, if you have a shell for the other user you may need to fiddle with xauth to make stuff work, but gksu* will take care of that for you
 marel, sudo -
 marel, sudo -i sorry
 ScottR3, su won't work for most people as out of the box there is no root password
 ScottR3, np
 marel, rm -rf foldernmae
 marel, be very careful before doing something like that as root
 TheXero, if you mean you have an ssd and a hdd I would put / on the ssd to improve boot and put /home on the hdd
 econdudeawesome, there is a bash profile in /etc which would be a global option
 TheXero, yes
 econdudeawesome, is the color prompt actually what you want? or are you trying to change background colors
 econdudeawesome, thats going to be something with the framebuffer not bash
 econdudeawesome, dunno google for linux framebuffer set color and see what you get
 marel, a python program probably doesn't have a configure/make. just look for a .py to run
 mang0, its very strange that it can't find the disks. when you boot the livecd and run gparted does it not see your disks?
 mang0, can you tell us a bit more about your hardware or pastebin the output from lspci
 dcweyh, works for everyone no "I tried to install a 64bit version on a 32bit machine"
 ojii, guessing you would have to switch your apt sources, update and then run a normal download packages, and then revert to the old apt sources and update again
 ex0a, no standard for that. ~/bin is sensible though
 ex0a, unless you want it for everyone in which case /opt
 graingert, some of the newer versions might, but i think it is safer to have an ext4 /boot
 graingert, btrfs on / is not something i would recommend. its a painful experience
 mang0, i need more details, like actual chipsets.
 mang0, feel free to /msg me
 mang0, sure
 PhoenixSTF, yes
 gib0t, alacarte
 PhoenixSTF, i've heard about assorted dropbox/nautilus issues, but don't use it myself. if this is post upgrade I would remove dropbox, reinstall nautilius and then reinstall dropbox
 harpal, grub2 autofinds kernels should just be able to drop it in /boot
 PhoenixSTF, shrug sorry
 harpal, i think it is grub-mkconfig
 someone235, if none of the exceptions apply to you can you please pastebin the contents of /var/log/dist-upgrade/
 NOC, you need to test if your smtp server is working, and then test if your php code is working
 NOC, try #ubuntu-server
 someone235, well the log of the problem is somewhere in there. if you can look through those files to identify any problems
 Guest31762, mac uses gpt not dos partition types. it shouldn't be giving you that error but gdisk can verify the gpt partition type
 Planet_EN, iwconfig eth0 mode Auto
 Planet_EN, is eth0 ethernet or wireless
 Planet_EN, is it wired or wireless
 mikebot, do you mean wubi?
 mikebot, wubi is a bit hairy. it creates a file on the ntfs (windows filesystem) and then somehow boots ubuntu with a loopback into that file. most people prefer using a virtual machine, or a straight install to the hard disk
 mikebot, i would suggest using virtualbox and running ubuntu as guest, or repartitioning
 mikebot, but you can always try wubi see what happens
 mikebot, free virtualmachine app from oracle/sn
 sun
 mikebot, well it is a virtual machine so yes
 econdudeawesome, is it fbset?
 econdudeawesome, dragging out some old old memories here
 Planet_EN, im uncertain what eth0 is... is eth0 a port on the side of your computer where you plug a wire, or is it a wireless connection
 econdudeawesome, it certainly is plymouth, but plymouth just modifies the framebuffer, you need to switch it back i think you can do stuff like that with fbset. you might check if there are gentoo docs on this
 _Neytiri_, shopt -s histappend and ...
 export PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'
 _Neytiri_, if that was what you meant
 _Neytiri_, as distinct from history?
 _Neytiri_, i don't know what you mean. you want to log all commands entered in bash? those are already stored in the users history if it is for personal use. or is for an audit/security
 OvidiuZeicu, take ownership? you shouldn't need to just mount the partitions and copy the data
 OvidiuZeicu, then sudo your copy command
 OvidiuZeicu, and make sure to use the switch to preserve permissions
 OvidiuZeicu, cp -aR
 roasted_, ubuntu only
 econdudeawesome, fbset may not be the right program but there is bound to be something similar. you could also check if plymouth is a script in which case it would call out to the background setting program. check the gentoo docs they had a period when everyone was configuring framebuffer backgrounds
 ssav, ssh as root is not encouraged, you can always ssh as normal user then sudo and do whatever you want
 ssav, yank the drive, mount on another system, sudo/chroot/passwd
 stefg, sudo -i is preferred
 Stameni, see if hotmail support pop or imap
 Stameni, then figure out what their pop or imap server is and then fill those details into evo
 ssav, if you know the root password you should be able to su
 ssav, if you cant su because your pam prevents it, and you cant get another login that will allow you to su you are hosed
 stefg, gzip </dev/sda4 > foo.gz works fine for me in sudo -i
 stefg, there are differences in things like environment variables for sure
 cordoval_, have you run fsck on the drives?
 cordoval_, in livecd fsck the drives, you could try and get into a chroot environment and resume the upgrade (assuming its non-bootable and there is no corruption
 cordoval_, but it may be easier to just reinstall
 cordoval_, before doing a bunch of dpkg stuff run fsck /dev/sda? on your partitions from the livecd
 cordoval_, then decide... is it a better use of your time to backup data and reinstall from scratch, or try to continue an upgrade of a potentially hosed system
 cordoval_, how far can you get in the boot? can you get to command line?
 cordoval_, better press M
 cordoval_, or get a livecd
 cordoval_, thats a busybox terminal
 cordoval_, you need to fsck /dev/sda?
 cordoval_, yeah a corrupt / is going to be a problem... get an install cd
 cordoval_, and it would be /dev/sda# for whatever your root partition is
 cordoval_, yep.
 cordoval_, yeah thats fine to fix the disk
 laumonier, grep lm /proc/cpuinfo to see if you have 64bit
 ror, no its not
 cordoval_, who is ror?
 cordoval_, you can still boot and run the fsck.
 cordoval_, step 1 is going to be fsck. step 2 is to decide between (a) backing up data, downloading disk and reinstalling or (b) trying to boot and resuming the install from console. i would suggest (a)
 jiltdil, its not just about ram, there are also more registers and sse extensions in 64bit
 cordoval_, ask about (b) AFTER you do the fsck please
 cordoval_, and (b) is substantially harder and may not result in a working system
 jiltdil, the wikipedia page on AMD64 is pretty informative. most developers are going 64bit, but some software (adobe flash) works a little better in 32bit
 yes and do it for all your partitions
 cordoval_, you may need to sudo
 cordoval_, you may want it to automatically fix any errors it finds in which case fsck -p
 cordoval_, good practice to see your errors first before you start correcting them, but yes
 cordoval_, that way you know that if it reports lots of errors on /usr/lib/libglib or some such that your libglib is hosed
 sebsebseb, for what?
 Eduard, have heard from some that it breaks unity
 Eduard, ok sorry
 cordoval_, please keep your comments to information not "rats!" we have lots of traffic on here
 cordoval_, depends on how things are configured, i understand you are frustrated but the channel is not the appropriate place we have 1800 people on it, and multiple conversations
 !help | varunvyas
 cordoval_, cat /proc/partitions will tell you all partitions, where / vs /boot vs /home might be is something you will have to remember
 varunvyas, does it say why is aborts?
 cordoval_, well fsck sda1, sda2, and sda5 (although 5 is probably a swap partition), do you remember how you configured your partitions
 timjk, rdesktop for windows style, various vnc clients, and ssh -X for the traditional unix approach
 !best | timjk
 !vnc | timjk
 cordoval_, could be an extended partition, check gparted and see what it says it is
 binoy, you need to forward the ssh port in your router
 binoy, then you cant do it
 binoy, thats not entirely true, you would have to have someone on the target machine start a connection to the outside though, so for all intents and purposes its not possible
 cordoval_, and can you confirm with gparted that sda1 was a large ext4 and that sda2 was extended with sda5 the logical inside which was swap
 cordoval_, ok now you have to decide, your options are the easy route of backing up your important data and reinstalling from scratch, or the challenging/may not work/may seem to work but secretly be broken method or trying to resume the install
 cordoval_, you could try. if you need to do a backup and don't have an external drive you can resize the sda1 partition and add a partition after it for your backup
 Johan2, and you added the public key to .ssh/authorized_keys on the target machine
 Johan2, sorry meant rimo0
 LAcan, do you have a wlan0
 LAcan, not sure... could be a driver issue
 LAcan, you could see if there is a service that manages the network. you could even restart the network service, or unload/reload the modules
 sburjan`, finally you can try unity --replace
 damiano__, check your /var/log as well perhaps it is closing immediately because of misconfiguration
 cordoval_, all that stuff is in /home
 !slow | pancho
 rimo0, you need to put your pub key in the auth_keys file on the target machine, and enable auth_keys login in sshd_config on target machine
 rimo0, it may also be that your local keyring is asking for the password to your keyring
 sburjan`, huh?
 rimo0, properly configured you can use ssh -i key.pub and not have to worry about passwords
 rimo0, so the server has a private key which it can use to authenticate any client who has the matching public key
 sburjan`, you don't have a panel anywhere?
 rimo0, because ssh key is thousands of characters, passphrase is 8
 sburjan`, did you get a message about your graphics hardware not being powerful enough (this is 11.04 right?
 sburjan`, confused... now you are at the login screen?
 sirgad, it is possible... not that i know how
 Elssha, no
 destinydriven, they are supposed to appear in the panel on top, some are a little finicky
 destinydriven, there is plugin for firefox check synaptic for unity firefox something
 destinydriven, its like unity integration or some such
 jdahm, that seems normal
 destinydriven, is it openoffice? its usually one of those two. sometimes it also gets confused if i alt-tab too much
 jdahm, yeah they are logical devices so that seems normal
 jdahm, the installer may not be familiar with them
 destinydriven, you download apatana from outside
 jdahm, you could install in degraded mode and then fix it up after, but thats not the best approach
 destinydriven, don't know if that would make a difference because it is outside apt
 jdahm, ie disable mdadm, install to /dev/sda# and then rebuild afterwards
 destinydriven, the real question is how to get unity to NOT take over the menu
 jdahm, see if you can mount md0 and md1, maybe once they are mounted the installer will play along
 jdahm, you might also try getting the mdadm.conf setup in your install environment see if that helps
 Elssha, ccsm
 michaelschmid, unless you can identify the library that was installing when it crashed
 michaelschmid, try force reinstall of naut, but its more likely a library issue
 Psychobudgie, and i've been thinking that was a graphical artifact
 !help | nandinux
 OchoZero9, gparted will allow you to resize/move
 OchoZero9, as with any partition changes make backups
 Psychobudgie, hard to say i feel like im over the hump and its starting to all seem normal. perhaps the workspace switcher not closing when you click on a workspace
 Leo, will any rsa key work? could you generate with gpg or ssh
 OchoZero9, you could uninstall stuff you don't need or remove stuff like old kernels 18gb is high but if you installed a lot of stuff
 michaelschmid, apt-get --reinstall install nautilus
 Leo, yeah i don't know ipsec or why that would hang
 Leo, if its a really big key it might require a lot of randomness, and if the server is misconfigured in some way it may not be accepting enough sources of entropy
 Leo, cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
 werever, good you?
 Leo, lol now you have to figure out what units that is
 werever, shouldn't be. its not the best day to do it... the servers are being hammered
 jo-erlend, +1 is closed now
 !final | escott
 werever, if you add its package archive to your list of apt archives you should be able to use it
 Leo, that seems pretty low check your entropy sources
 Leo, I have 600
 Leo, and now i have like 100 :)
 Monotoko, thought WoW had a linux client
 Leo, no but typing into an ssh shell may not do anything for entropy because it doesn't generate any kernel traffic (beyond the NIC) and the NIC might be invalidated because it is outside accessible and potentially hostile
 Leo, see if you can generate disk io
 Leo, http://bredsaal.dk/improving-randomness-and-entropy-in-ubuntu-9-10
 arrrghhh, gpt will avoid that limit
 jnlsnl_, php -i
 OchoZero9, /usr/bin for binaries /usr/share for resources /usr/lib for you get the ide
 the67pc, gnome-screensaver-control -lock
 Monotoko, flightgear
 sam555, syslog should say
 LAcan, swapoff and then grow, but not advisable if you run out of memory
 LAcan, it could
 Leo, excellent mine seems to drop too i'm not sure what could be using entropy you could lsof /dev/random
 LAcan, also without swap you can't suspend/resume
 LAcan, any grown of a mounted partition must happen offlien
 jnlsnl_, you may have permission problems with that
 dotblank, unless ssh changes ownership of the file. he could add a host as root and find it broken for jnlsnl_
 BajK, we have xrandr, but nvidia doesn't support it fully
 nerdshell, cant
 cordoval_, locate havlet returns nothing for me. no idea what that is
 cordoval_, i don't know what havlet is. never heard of that program, its not on my system anywhere
 cordoval_, hal i know what that is... not sure what evt is googling
 cordoval_, hal events manager
 cordoval_, sounds like a plan, and avoid hot plugging during the install
 cordoval_, seems to be common and hal is deprecated so i doubt this is getting lots of attention. if you have any usb devices plugged in i would remove them
 acicula, talk to arand or myself before going btrfs on /
 cordoval_, sure? whatever version you want to install the halevt was on 10.10?
 jdahm, you will need to have a valid mdadm.conf on the system, you could copy it or rebuild it post install, copying may be easier
 cordoval_, its up to you what version you want to run
 cordoval_, the halevt happened when you tried a fresh install of 10.10 during install, or post install during upgrade to natty?
 cordoval_, i would wait a few days until things settle down and try again
 cordoval_, unless you enjoy installing
 Kyle__, start the program then right click on it and pin it
 jdahm, grub should be configured to point at sda1 not md1, and should boot degraded then once the kernel is up and md modules loaded it should bring up sdb1
 jdahm, you were doing raid1 right?
 jdahm, thats the way i've always done it. should be fine
 jdahm, that should be fine as long as the md stuff is in the initrd
 jdahm, ever taken apart an initrd before?
 jdahm, if you want you could do that. copy the initrd off and gunzip it. then mount it loopback as ext2
 jdahm, you will see a base prelim filesystem in it. it needs your mdadm.conf and the mdadm kernel modules
 jdahm, you think grub-install didn't work?
 jdahm, try rerunning grub-install from a chroot environment
 jdahm, you will need to bind mount /dev to your chroot
 jdahm, had the feeling you had done this before
 jdahm, ok don't know if you saw this: https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/advanced-installation.html
 jdahm, shouldn't that be sda3 or 5 or something
 jdahm, i lied thats right
 jdahm, unfortunately there are like NO DOCS for grub2 so i dont know what error 16 is
 jdahm, really how can you tell?
 jdahm, does it show menu and do the stage 1.0 1.5 nonsense, cause they got right of that with grub2
 jdahm, the font size can vary in grub2 depending upon config, but you are actually getting to a menu?
 jdahm, do you think you might have a grub1 install on sdb's mbr?
 thanos, what happened
 jdahm, sure do grub-install on all the mbrs
 thanos, can't mount from livecd
 thanos, the live cd might not like your btrfs if it is a few versions behind in kernel from your last booted kernel, but ext4 shouldn't be a problem
 thanos, what does it say when you: sudo mkdir /mnt/ext4; sudo mount /dev/sda? /mnt/ext4;
 jdahm, the old grub is now called grub-pc or grub-legacy
 jdahm, ie grub2
 thanos, huh? how did you get that from a terminal command, open a terminal and type: sudo mkdir /mnt/ext4; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/ext4;
 thanos, adjust sda1 if the name is something else
 zatan, ehhh usually just create a new user with the desired name and move files
 zatan, you could try just renaming your $HOME after creating a user but it could get messy
 thanos, why are you sending me fdisk output?
 thanos, evidently what happens when you do sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/ext4
 thanos, please mount | pastebinit
 thanos its mounted fine, /dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0) /dev/sda3 on /media/22c795f0-2bb4-4730-9f46-bd422497a4be type btrfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks)
 jdahm, no grub 1 is grub-pc
 jdahm, sorry im wrong
 jdahm, grub-pc is grub2 and the old grub1 is grub
 thanos, well sda3 is mounted on /media/22c...
 thanos, for sda6 you just need to define your mountpoint and mountit
 thanos, with sudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/mountpoint-of-your-choosing
 thanos, are you expecting a window to just pop-up
 cassio, should be accessible in ccsm
 thanos, you need to mkdir that mountpoint first
 zombie__, libreoffice open office is dead
 ninjai, because you aren't getting a login shell
 ninjafish, man ssh | grep login  If command is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.
 ninjafish, meant for ninjai
 ninjai, instead of ssh "ls $MYVARIABLE" do ssh "/bin/bash --login \"ls $MYVARIABLE\""
 phoenixsampras, you cant
 jdahm, excellent
 jdahm, so it was a stray mbr?
 jdahm, well now you have plenty of backup mbrs if sda goes out
 jdahm, thats a lot of ram
 mmjunaid, thats correct
 mmjunaid, thats the old 10.10 syntax though, it is changed slightly in 11.04
 thebigroflz, no if you want to tinker you could try and get a usb key to do your decrypting, but then you would have to take lots of stuff out of the encrypted partition http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/02/how-encrypted-home-ecryptfs-works.html
 KNUBBIG, depends on what kinds of mods you made
 KNUBBIG, i would just diff the two and take the parts you want
 KNUBBIG, i think the biggest difference is that you can say sda instead of hd0
 JaymesKeller, have you loaded the correct modules for your raid controller
 mordof, su to user with uid 1000
 mordof, or root
 mordof, 1000 is by default the first non-root user on the system
 JaymesKeller, its "soft-raid" you can read lots of cursing about that online
 !final | kavurt its been pretty quiet on release day
 Ziber, its part of alsa
 Ziber, is this the same problem from 2 days ago?
 JaymesKeller, is mdarray part of mdadm or dmraid (they are different)
 erik333, in unity you don't thats the whole idea :)
 JaymesKeller, dmarray would be part of dmraid not mdadm. i'm not familiar with device-mapper
 JaymesKeller, see man dmarray i don't know it
 JaymesKeller, and if it follows standard terminology you would assemble it and then mount a device /dev/dmarray1 or some such
 conical, you have put sudo in front of the command
 conical, then gksudo
 conical, add them to /etc/fstab
 conical, otherwise you have to get a daemon like gnome-disk-utility to handle hotplug events
 tharsis, events to what? an x client?
 tharsis, xsendkeys
 tharsis, you don't have root?
 tharsis, well lineakd has all the stuff you need xsendkeys/xevtest. what happens when you cat into the keyboard device? maybe you can create a fake keyboard device that pipes text through it. you could also try
 tharsis, http://www.doctort.org/adam/nerd-notes/x11-fake-keypress-event.html
 Thriky, more simply you could use nohup
 !help | Mehrab_ NyvenZA
 NyvenZA, nvidia/ati or intel? have you tried an external usb keyboard/have one available
 gwallace42, at what point in the boot
 SoftTimur, there is no http:// in front of about:config, and you should get a warning where you have to say "I'll be careful"
 gwallace42, does it drop you to a busybox shell?
 gwallace42, so you have the busybox shell (M manual recovery open)
 gwallace42, and do you know what the / mountpoint is?
 rather what the drive is
 gwallace42, (a) is there a /dev/sda1 (b) what are the contents of /proc/partitions (c) can you fsck /dev/sda1
 econdudeawesome, ubuntu classic from the gdm login screen (after putting your name in)
 usr13, he is in his initrd
 maximus_, don't use suspend myself
 usr13, do you know how the initrd transfers into the true root? is it just a bind mount?
 gwallace42, sda2 is an extended partition with a single logical (sda5 for swap) inside it. blockcount 1 is normal
 gwallace42, can you check the output of mount to confirm sda1 not mounted
 usr13, he is stuck in initrd because drive was not ready
 gwallace42, sounds like a race in your boot with initrd wanting to mount the rootfs and the pci not being fully initialized. we probably need to put a delay in for your hardware
 gwallace42, confirm that you can mount the sda1 partition with mkdir /mnt/rootfs; mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/rootfs
 gwallace42, sda or sda1?
 gwallace42, can you ls the contents of /home then? do you see your home folder
 gwallace42, hmmm well thats weird
 gwallace42, yeah you don't need to do that. i thought sda1 wasn't getting mounted
 gwallace42, mount -o remount,rw / and see what it says
 gwallace42, if you can remount you could try sudo init 5 to see if you can get to a gui
 gwallace42, you don't even need the sudo
 gwallace42, i wonder if the device could have been mounted in between the error message and the time it took us to start running commands in the busybox shell
 gwallace42, have you ever waited to see if the error will disappear on its own?
 !ccsm | nodie
 gwallace42, init 5 didnt do any good?
 gwallace42, im just curious if you can resume the boot from this point or if it is completely borked
 gwallace42, ok
 gwallace42, is udevd --daemon running
 gwallace42, well the drive seems fine so you should be able to copy the system image around (if you don't mind moving multi gig files around)
 gwallace42, and i've been told that there is an install option for presevering /home
 preserving
 gwallace42, my suspicious is that the boot is going too fast there seems to be nothing wrong with the drive
 gwallace42, if it were me I would see if there is some what to slow down the boot process. i know you could do it by gunziping the initrd, and adding a sleep somewhere between when udev starts and the remount happens
 gwallace42, there may be a better way though
 gwallace42, goodluck
 gwallace42, the initrd process isn't that bad, just annoying, you just unzip, loop mount the file, make your changes and then mkinitrd and replace
 Geekydude4, ctrl-c or q
 Geekydude4, just the program you are using to view
 conical, your router will usually want to be a dns, but you might be able to turn it off
 conical, rather i mean dhcp
 exad, it would be in your bios
 exad, i thought optimus did something weird running the nvidia controls through the intel card. but check the forums and see
 jnovek, /etc/gdm/custom.conf
 BKTech86, have you reinstalled grub?
 BKTech86, do you know what win 7 did?
 BKTech86, sounds like you don't have a bootloader in the mbr
 BKTech86, you would need to boot the livecd, chroot into the ubuntu system, then run grub-install /dev/sda
 BKTech86, yeah best not to trust the script
 BKTech86, when you get to the live cd open a terminal
 BKTech86, then do the following: sudo mkdir /mnt/ubuntu; sudo mount /dev/sda# /mnt/ubuntu (# should be your ubuntu root partition); sudo mount /dev/sda# /mnt/ubuntu/boot (if you have a boot partition); sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/ubuntu/dev; sudo chroot /mnt/ubuntu; sudo grub-install /dev/sda1
 BKTech86, yes
 BKTech86, then skip that command
 BKTech86, sorry sudo grub-install /dev/sda (no number)
 BKTech86, :) hmmm you could try grub-install --recheck /dev/sda maybe that will silence the warning
 BKTech86, we didn't bind mount the /proc
 BKTech86, in another terminal execute sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/ubuntu/proc
 BKTech86, that should silence the warnings
 Blue1, yes restoring the mbr
 BKTech86, yes try after that bind mount
 Blue1, seems to be a lot of broken grubs after this upgrade
 BKTech86, cross your fingers and reboot?
 Blue1, i feel like this is one of those things people will just want to be walked through
 BKTech86, but you can mount /dev/sda5 fine
 Blue1, I know just a comment on the psychology of the situation... not booting freaks people out
 BKTech86, have you run an fsck on it?
 its a well chosen command name :) if anyone says your filesystem is fsck'ed you know what they mean
 BKTech86, although yours sounds fine which is what is so confusing
 BKTech86, probably just a gui for it. how is your system partitioned
 BKTech86, bios could mess things up but the bios shouldn't mess with the bootloader loading
 BKTech86, and swap as /dev/sda4 or /dev/sda6 or so
 BKTech86, yeah sounds normal
 BKTech86, so you don't get anything from grub. its like it never starts
 BKTech86, shouldn't matter but you could toggle the bootable flag on some partitions (namely 1 and 5
 BKTech86, fdisk /dev/sda
 BKTech86, i think bootable flag is "a" and then "w" to write the changes (don't touch anything else though)
 BKTech86, the bootable flag shouldn't matter to grub, but it cant hurt
 BKTech86, yeah but the bios starts grub, it shouldn't even touch the partitions so it really shouldn't matter
 BKTech86, thats what we just did, putting grub in the mbr
 BKTech86, mbr is the first 512 bytes of the disk, not on the mbr
 not in the bios
 bios starts the mbr, mbr scans partition table, looks for the /boot partition, then starts running os. so bios is out of the picture as soon as grub starts
 BKTech86, don't know i generally don't use the gui
 BKTech86, fdisk /dev/sda "a" is the bootable flag "w" to write changes
 BKTech86, what is your hardware?
 BKTech86, just wondering if there was anything exotic sounds there isnt
 BKTech86, and its only the one disk right
 BKTech86, its a toggle
 BKTech86, so when you reboot it just blinks at you?
 BKTech86, so its working now?
 im getting really confused by all these grub boot failures. seems if you fiddle with the partition table things start to magically work. anyone else noticed that?
 hhjjff, you can get the android emulator
 BKTech86, bioses can do weird things... although it shouldn't be doing that
 hhjjff, but its a developer tool not a "I want to use this as a real app" tool
 jprobe, doubt there are any seeds
 keithclark, or `which mame`
 keithclark, it won't have an extension it will just be called mame
 keithclark, or have mame in the name
 uhuhuh, have you deleted your .wine directory
 Laggg1, sudo mkdir /mnt/ubuntu; sudo mount /dev/sda# /mnt/ubuntu; sudo mount /dev/sda# /mnt/ubuntu/boot (if you have a /boot partition); sudo chroot /mnt/ubuntu; sudo grub-install /dev/sda
 Laggg1, sorry left out two... after mount onto /mnt/ubuntu but before chroot mount --bind /dev /mnt/ubuntu/dev and the same for /proc
 Laggg1, make the mountpoint, mount the partition (you've done that) bind mount /dev with sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/ubuntu/dev and /proc sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/ubuntu/proc then chroot
 Laggg1, you have to adjust that to where you mounted your ubuntu system (check by running mount)
 jorgp, not without guest addiytions
 Laggg1, can you pastebin the output of mount and the output of ls /mnt/blah where blah is what the folder where you mounted your ubuntu system
 Laggg1, yes you mount the ubuntu system, chroot into it, and then install grub to the mbr of the disk
 kpoman, if it doesn't come back on logout login try unity --replace
 kpoman, try compiz &
 Laggg, ok so you got grub to load, but its not giving you a menu
 Laggg, well you can do a minimal boot as set root (hd1,#) linux /boot/vmlinuz-??? root=/dev/sdb#
 Laggg, initrd /boot/initrd.img????; boot
 Laggg, thats 4 commands total
 Laggg, you can use ls to fill in the details on the version numbers
 Laggg, since you have two drives there is always the possibility that you are booting a grub on the wrong mbr
 Laggg, so I always recommend installing grub to both mbrs
 Laggg, which you could do from either a chroot or if you can get a boot from the rescue prompt
 BKTech86, mount -o remount,rw /dev/blah
 BKTech86, but i dont think hfs is writable
 Laggg, glad to here
 lduros, /etc/grub/custom.conf
 lduros, remove it
 lduros, you may need to restart the gdm service
 JoFo, hit the unity icon and type in keyboard. is it one of those
 JoFo, top left of the screen
 necreo, glxinfo will tell you what glx driver you are using
 Sledge, did compiz/unity crash. you could try restarting from a terminal if you can access one
 Sledge, have you tried logging out and starting a new session?
 Sledge, or nuke the .compiz/config folder
 rather .config/compiz
 multi_io, probably in ccsm
 kopeG, could you hotplug a usb keyboard?
 multi_io, don't know then. its not designed to be as configurable as gnome2
 d3tour, what program are you using to record?
 Froq, xchat
 a2c4n9e1, are you being a NAT? most people are
 a2c4n9e1, if your ip address is 192.168.X.X you can't be ping from anyone outside your network
 stravant, have you tried alsamixer?
 !help | alone08
 a2c4n9e1, you can check your iptables, but also check the router config to make sure that net B has a route to net A
 alone08, install gcc look at man gcc
 a2c4n9e1, its tough to say without knowing more details
 a2c4n9e1, it is possible to configure to not respond to ping, so check iptables and flush any rules if they exist
 a2c4n9e1, but are you sure the router isn't acting as a NAT?
 Wardje, think it is just "ssh"
 Wardje, mean herol3oy
 a2c4n9e1, then flush your iptables
 a2c4n9e1, from the command line sudo iptables --list to show tables sudo iptables --flush
 a2c4n9e1, and if you have another computer on the same subnet as the ubuntu try to ping from it to verify that the ubuntu system responds to pings
 a2c4n9e1, if it does then your problem is in your router/routes on the other network
 AlecTaylor, have you tried xrandr on the guest?
 akashm1990, reinstall/etc-keeper/btrfs snapshots there is no single comand
 akashm1990, if you've broken something let us know and we can try to fix it
 TuffPoo, thats wine warning you to chmod +x the windows executables you trust
 herol3oy, there is an ssh-server but the only "service" would be the sshd not the client. agreed it seems a little weird name for the service
 TuffPoo, i believe that should make wine shut up
 herol3oy, sshd is the ssh daemon (runs in the background providing a server to connect to), ssh is the client allows you to connect to other servers
 akashm1990, grub is pretty much automatic these days. are you concerned about some other os?
 herol3oy, well they are both openssh but one is the client only, the other is the server only so install openssh-server and then start the ssh service
 TuffPoo, is there a #wine channel?
 akashm1990, a reinstall would reinstall grub, but i never did anything special to get win 7 to boot
 akashm1990, if you had a lot of trouble in the past you might have trouble with a reinstall
 akashm1990, i don't see any reason to expect anything different this time. but you can always install grub from chroot its not that bad (I've walked a half-dozen people throught it the last few days)
 akashm1990, it will just overwrite the existing mbr during the install
 akashm1990, just don't do it the hour before you need your computer for XYA
 aussa, in the makefile look for the OSGXmltokenizer target, look up until you see a line with gcc -c and try to change that
 KNUBBIG, you have to have a login shell i think it is ssh -i
 KNUBBIG, if you just ssh john@host "command x" then command x is run but not as a login shell. ie profile, bashrc, etc are ignored
 leoechevarria, glxgears is very deceptive always look at glxinfo
 leoechevarria, run glxinfo (mesa can easily handle glxgears these days)
 leoechevarria, the vendor and render version strings
 mine say OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) Ironlake Mobile GEM 20100330 DEVELOPMENT yours should say something about NVIDIA
 leoechevarria, i didnt catch all that was happening. unity 3d won't come up?
 SeanInSeattle, if you start it you may be able to pin the icon to the panel
 leoechevarria, and have you tried manually starting compiz
 leoechevarria, what nvidia card is it?
 GarryFre, jump lists? popups from the panel?
 leoechevarria, you could pastebin the glxinfo output, but i'm not really sure what to look for
 Pascalcmoi, what about a kernel that used to work
 tortoise, thats a pretty old ppa you may want to purge it with ppa-purge (its for lucid lynx)
 Pascalcmoi, well you could remove the newer kernel and continue to boot the older one. if it is spontanteously rebooting like that thought, I don't know how to trace the issue, except to start building your own kernel
 tortoise, is there a reason you don't want to use ubuntu firefox
 tortoise, no a ppa is for testing software or for things that are configured differently from stock ubuntu
 Rehan, remove the options psmouse line from /etc/modprobe.d/psmouseconf. and sudo rmmod psmouse
 tortoise, yes
 tortoise, you will want to look at ppa-purge then use synaptic to install firefox
 !ppa-purge | tortoise
 tortoise, sudo apt-get ppa-purge. just look over what you plan to do first, because in the meantime you wont have a browser
 GarryFre, it should be white font on black background. have you looked at the theme?
 akharris, the wikipedia page explains the differences between 64 and 32 bit architectures. you can see if you have 64 bit by looking for "lm" in the flags section of your /proc/cpuinfo
 tortoise, are you running lucid?
 akharris, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64
 tortoise, ok well then it makes some sense to have a ppa if you want firefox 4, otherwise you are stuck with 3.2? but the mozillateam hasn't released any packages or has changed names. maybe someone else has packaged firefox 4 for lucid
 mastaofdisasta, what laptop is this?
 !help | sly
 GarryFre, ubuntu has some additions for firefox including a theme package. you might reinstall those/check that they are enabled
 sly, if you have a brand new laptop with intel processors hda_analyzer.py from the alsa group can be helpful
 akharris, first check alsamixer command line that nothing is muted
 tortoise, yeah the old version of firefox is fine
 tortoise, you have to purge the ppa which involves uninstalling firefox, and removing the ppa from your apt-sources, and then reinstall firefox
 tortoise, the ppa-purge script merely automates the removal and makes sure that nothing else installed by that ppa
 aussa, it should generate an executable you can run (and shouldn't finish with lots of errors)
 newb_, the gnome3-ppa tends to break unity (or so i have heard)
 tortoise, there should be only one firefox listed in synaptic after you remove the mozillateam ppa
 uberfrau, is that the correct place to put the plugin? (i have no idea), you might check on #gnome?
 sly, i only know my trick for intel hda devices
 aussa, you have to scroll through the errors and find the first one
 klingan, locate
 kad_, you can sorta delete stuff from gnome-activity-journal but that feature is a few months out
 klingan, `locate filename` to search the filesystem
 Fragy, do you have two disks
 kad_, yeah its a bit buggy. i saw one a blog posting from one of the zeitgeist developers on gnome blog and he had mockups of zeitgeist history clearing and blacklisting
 Fragy, one change from 10.10 to 11.04 was in the grub.conf to change `set root(hd0,msdos1)` to `set root(sda,msdos1)` it could be your grub.conf didn't get updated, but your mbr did and grub is warning about the syntax change
 kad_, for now at least
 mah454, probably a cupsd issue, but i don't know for sure
 glycan, you need a shebang #!/usr/bin/python in line one, you need to chmod +x and you need to add to path (skip this and do ./)
 glycan, cd /path/to/app; ./appname.py
 glycan, alternately modify .bashrc to have this: export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/app"
 glycan, #! is shebang
 glycan, do `which python` in terminal
 dury, it doesn't work if you just follow the instructions substituting pendrive for cd?
 Abbas-uB, its a really busy few days as well with all the new users and upgrades
 dury, i know but the pendrive should have the cd image, does it get stuck and not let you continue?
 dury, its stuck in the install gui right? at what point does it get stuck
 tayyabali, /join #gnome
 Krishnandu, most upgrades are done off the web not from iso, but you could add the iso to your apt-sources and then try to upgrade
 dury, so its taken all your config info/partitioned folders and then gets stuck
 Krishnandu, if you put the disk in and then go to synaptic -> preferences -> software sources you should be able to add a volume
 dury, i've only ever done cd installs, so im not familiar with the usb method. the only thing I could think to do would be to edit /etc/apt/sources.list to point to the repo on your usb keychain
 alessio_alex, if you dont like unity use the classic interface from the gdm login screen (after you type in your username)
 alessio_alex, logout and on your next login choose classic from the dropdown at the bottom of the login screen
 Omega, his sources list is pointing to a non-existent cd. so he can't install the software on the usb. i'm not sure if the usb image is wonky or what
 soc, an export import or settings from the evo menu would be preferred
 soc, you could try, but i would back it up first
 alessio_alex, you logout. type your name in. on the bottom where it says session type you pick the classic type
 alessio_alex, you have to logout and login again. sounds like you need to disable auto login from gdmconfig
 soc, im not really clear on what it is doing that you don't want happening
 soc, evo is going to create what evo needs to create. to try what you want you would need to close evo. delete the folders. place your data. start evo
 Walex2, probably in /etc/udev/rules.d
 gdea73, can you confirm it is msdos and not gpt partitioned?
 gdea73, its actually the partitioning scheme. is windows on the same disk?
 Krishnandu, it seems some bioses dislike allowing grub access to partitions not marked with the bootable flag so have him set the bootable flag on his ubuntu and windows partitions
 gdea73, the bootloader goes onto mbr /dev/sda not /dev/sda1
 Krishnandu, use fdisk to set the bootable flag on the windows and ubuntu /boot partition (/ if he doesn't have /boot). there are lots of other details that we would need to know like how many disks he has, i've seen people have problems when they have multiple disks and only install grub on one of the mbr's
 gdea73, you probably don't need to reformat, just use the livecd to chroot in and install grub to the mbr
 Krishnandu, so add the boot flag to the /boot partition
 Krishnandu, sudo fdisk /dev/sda then "a" "number of partition" "w"
 Krishnandu, the number of the partition you want to set bootable
 glycan, ifconfig
 Krishnandu, "a" it will ask the partition number "9" and then you write the changes with "w"
 glycan, install ccsm. and you just wanted the inet addr
 HelloWorld321, hopefully better than dropbox, yes, talk with your lawyer
 sakuramboo, check your glxinfo
 sakuramboo, does it look right for your hardware. its possible to install things that can break glx
 Dedego, install build-essentials and gcc
 Dedego, it sure seems to think you dont have gcc installed so confirm that it is there
 Dedego, and it is in your path? `which gcc` returns /usr/bin/gcc?
 Dedego, sounds like a problem with that configure script
 Dedego, no idea, you can always try
 tansell-laptop, is bc05 your mac address or that of the router
 tansell-laptop, sounds like you need to specify a wep or wpa2 password
 Dedego, build-essential is a meta package removing it won't do much
 bmfx1, sensors and sensors-detect
 Krishnandu, sounds like the grub-install wasn't done correctly or something is confusing grub.if he wants to get on the channel in the next 30 minutes ill still be eating lunch so having him pm me
 Sub_Zero, its likely a new intel laptop
 Sub_Zero, you developers don't know the board configuration, and don't know what pins to disable when you plugin the headphone. you can manually disable pins with hda_analyzer.py from alsa
 dougl, you could also have your router reserve the ip for that particular mac address, which may be easier
 dougl, depends on your router and its firmware
 dougl, go to http://192.168.1.1 (assuming that is your router) and see if there is an option to reserve the ip by mac address
 dougl, the stock firmware from linksys isn't always the most configurable. you could see if tomato supports your device if you don't mind flashing new firmware
 !md5 | zach_
 dougl, if you cant find it try "tomato firmware"
 dougl, well if you go the router approach you technically wouldn't be static, you would be dynamic but the router would keep giving the same numeric ip lease (which is why that would be easier if your router supports i)
 dougl, try http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r20956187-WRT54GS-wDDWRT-Force-IP-to-MAC
 user82, history
 billybob, check your glxinfo to see what renderer you have
 billybob, what video card is this?
 billybob, if thats really old it may not be powerful enough for compositing, but ati's are reasonably well supported
 skullboy, doubt you can, its not the most configurable thing
 chrome_, it is in 11.04
 chrome_, lsb_release -a in the terminal
 chrome_, first check the website to see if you want 11.04 there are big differences, but if you want to go ahead start upgrade-manager
 chrome_, drop into #ubuntu-offtopic and ask peoples opinions or just hang around and listen, some hate it others love it
 rgb247, its always fun to see what happens when the shell tries to delete itself
 chrome_, yes sorry
 chrome_, PLEASE look at the release notes on unity and natty narwhal, we get lots of people coming in and complaining about how much they hate it
 chrome_, or how it broke stuff
 chrome_, if you are on 10.04 yes you have to upgrade to 10.10 first
 chrome_, if you don't want to upgrade you could see if there is a lucid mozilla ppa
 xskydevilx, you won't be able to access ext4 from windows, if you want to share files between the two you need to create a third partition (ntfs) just for sharing
 eigba, mostly
 sarthor, you are inside the initrd. you need to fsck your root filesystem first
 sarthor, that may be easier from a live cd
 sarthor, the best thing may be to boot the live cd then chroot into the system and resume the upgrade
 sarthor, you could try remounting it mount -o remount,rw /
 sarthor, but im not sure how resumable the install is in runlevel1
 patrunjel, you will have to reinstall grub
 patrunjel, simple is a relative term... all you do is boot the livecd, bind mount the special filesystems, chroot and run grub-install
 sarthor, i guess run with it, see where it goes
 !grub | patrunjel
 Emylbus, if you have a 32bit application you want to use, if you dont want to take advantage of 64bit features in your processor
 Emylbus, thats not to say you can't run 32bit applications, but they may run better in a 32bit os
 dynoboyz, ouch you need to rescue with windows, but you are looking at restore from backup as the most likely result here

 Calif, i think you just said your main options there
 Calif, usually you just send a request to their servers and they update the dns entry, doubt you even need a client for that

 _Neytiri_, a symlink would be easier
 _Neytiri_, but you should just be able to pass the -d option to useradd
 Inphernal, have you held any packages in apt
 Inphernal, try dpkg --get-selections
 Inphernal, you are interested in the ones that don't say install
 !classic | killaz
 Inphernal,  pipe it to grep -v install
 Inphernal, dpkg --get-selections | grep -v install
 bluenote, have you tried running the post-it application?
 bluenote, there are dozens of stickynote applications if you could figure out which one...
 !classic | bluenote
 bluenote, see if you can find it there
 Inphernal, i don't know but we eliminated that one possibility :)
 bluenote, just saying switch over and figure out the app name then come back to unity
 Inphernal, afraid not
 bluenote, thats ok i wasnt too clear
 bluenote, see if it is tomboy
 brian_, usalabs i think it is possible to chain load the ext4 partitions but you have to install grub onto the partition not the mbr which is flaky
 yepitsme19, no and there wont be until 11.10
 yepitsme19, unfortunately... unity uses some gnome2 stuff in a way that is very hard to reconcile with the gnome3 until unity is moved up to gtk3
 yepitsme19, you could try the ppa but it reportedly breaks unity
 mitoni, no
 pindropper, bash likes spaces in tests, i think that is the source of your problem, you may also try #bash
 dusf, the only legal way to run osx is on mac hardware
 killaz__, if you want to discuss ways around the eula feel free to do so anywhere but on this channel
 ikonia, do you know what the next step for Inphernal is we confirmed he has nothing held, but i'm unsure why we would be getting resolve errors?
 damicita, click pull out from the panel, then drag up or down
 damicita, i mean do it to the panel. its like a drag and drop, but you have to pull out to center a bit
 damicita, you might look for a youtube video, its hard to explain, you want to pull the icon towards the center of the screen and then without releasing it bring it back down
 damicita, the icon should come out of the panel and be replaced by a cursor
 damicita, there are some that won't move namely the last 4
 Oday, mv directory/* newdirectory/
 xeodox, if you register mydomain.com
 vessago, chmod -w filename
 natanielcz, http://paste.ubuntu.com/602011/
 Doom_-_, chmod 777
 natanielcz, http://paste.ubuntu.com/602012/ for unity session
 Ziber, you mean alt-tab?
 ocx, i think you need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list
 urlicht, yes copy the files from /var/cached/apt/archive to save the downloading
 malik_, i think so try #bash if you have concerns
 Xgates, hard to answer... what 32bit apps are you concerned about
 Xgates, it basically comes down to flash and there are more issues with flash and compiz than with flash and 64bit it would seem
 kneaux, nvidia or ati
 kneaux, what does xrandr say about your allowed geometries
 kneaux, could very well be the source of trouble. xorg is getting better and detecting more automatically but that means it has more opportunities to detect it incorrectly
 kneaux, i would try and set it through xrandr, but if you cant you could force your modelines into xorg.conf
 paranoidphreak, what is /etc/exports NFS?
 kneaux, so its guessing at bad modes from the display can you force a good mode with xrandr?
 Dpena, is this inside a virtual machine or is this dual boot
 sycko, have you tried plugging into different usb ports
 sycko, after the keyboard stops responding is it still listed in lsusb or was it removed
 !samba | chipmenk
 paranoidphreak, i dont know what that file is for
 sycko, you seem to have covered the bases... sounds like a usb isue
 kneaux, when you turn off mirror screens any change in what xrandr reports
 sycko, you could try booting the older kernel if you still have it as an option
 paranoidphreak, is that samba? or NFS?
 paranoidphreak, and you have matching uid's from server to client?
 paranoidphreak, NFS requires that you have the same set of users on both systems.
 paranoidphreak, and then it just uses the same permission model
 sycko, well the keyboard would be usbhid, but i wouldnt remove that because it would also be the mouse
 sycko, the webcam should have its own module or maybe some generic v4lusb module

 acicula, intel_hda reports itself as all kinds of stuff it is snd_hda_intell
 acicula, yes
 Greensky, try apt-cdrom
 acicula, mine is 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio (rev 06) but its Conextant in alsa
 zeleftikam, what sound problems are you having? no audio at all
 zeleftikam, you could try fiddling with sound card internal config using hda_analyzer from alsa
 paul, searching contents grep
 tixo5, libreoffice
 acicula, zeleftikam that just applies some guesses about layout
 snd_hda_intel is pretty generic, lots of hardware has it, but each is configured slightly differently. the option provides some initial setup. so if you have it definitely use it/check most recent alsa. if you dont have it use hda_analyer to figure out the layout and forward to alsa people
 acicula, reporting that hda_analyzer works? it does, but its bloody confusing at first
 acicula, it took me 2 months to get the hang of it (i wasn't trying that hard) and by then my board was fixed
 ie someone had sent the layout in to alsa and it got pulled in from upstream
 nartkcin, no
 acicula, yes you can do that, if the board is known
 acicula, and the abundance of new configurations. all new intel laptops have intel_hda, but they all have the headphones connected to a different port it seems
 acicula, zeleftikam check this first http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio-Models.txt
 acicula, zeleftikam but i dont see the ALC888B listed so... you could try it as an alc880, but you may have to tweak it with hda_analyzer
 zeleftikam, those are the board/chip combos that the alsa developers have seen and developed working configs for. i'm saying i dont see yours on there, so you may have to pick something close and work from there
 acicula, for a lot of hda problems you can direct people to http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Help_To_Debug_Intel_HDA

 Froq, the only reason to use chameleon over grub is to run osx which we dont do because that would be illegal sorry

 PaidSupport, also check /sys/class/backlight to see if it is recognized at kernel level
 PaidSupport, well thats the real source of the trouble, can you boot the old kernel
 ocx, you would have to reparent the process, i don't think that is possible, you would have to have started it in something like screen
 PaidSupport, the fact that there is nothing in /sys/class/backlight means you will never get the backlight through userspace, i would try force installing the old kernel
 then you can see if there is maybe a module in lsmod on the old kernel not in the new kernel and going from there
 PaidSupport, i would download the .deb of the kernel from 10.10 and installing it directly
 PaidSupport, if you wanted to drop down to 10.10
 but it may be easier to just install the kernel
 PaidSupport, you had intel graphics?
 PaidSupport, having intel graphics makes things easier
 Gnea, he did a fresh install so he doesn't have those anymore
 PaidSupport, 32bit or 64bit
 PaidSupport, no but you have to get the right kernel im trying to find a package for you
 does anyone know where the actual ubuntu .debs are mirrored
 jenkinSear, is the kernel-ppa going to be the same as what was released with 10.10, and do you know what else might need to be grabbed with the kernel?
 PaidSupport, try downloading this: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.36-rc8-maverick/linux-image-2.6.36-020636rc8-generic_2.6.36-020636rc8.201010150908_amd64.deb
 jenkinSear, except we are planning to force install it...
 well if you just apt-get install linux-image.*.deb that will install it
 hopefully
 :)
 arand, im not sure, ive not actually forced down a kernel before
 he has intel graphics so that takes care of one potential problem
 arand, is kernel-ppa a different kernel than what is shipped?
 just want to try forcing his natty kernel back to maverick to see if his backlight comes back
 PaidSupport, if you are still there then lets download something different :)
 PaidSupport, there is a kernel ppa team that provides a mainline kernel (no patches) and we should try that but using the natty version so we need three things apparently im reading here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam
 arand, Jordan_U would you recommend just adding the kernel-ppa as a ppa?
 PaidSupport, then lets delete the previous download and download these instead
 http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.39-rc4-natty/linux-image-2.6.39-020639rc4-generic_2.6.39-020639rc4.201104191410_amd64.deb
 http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.39-rc4-natty/linux-headers-2.6.39-020639rc4-generic_2.6.39-020639rc4.201104191410_amd64.deb
 http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.39-rc4-natty/linux-headers-2.6.39-020639rc4_2.6.39-020639rc4.201104191410_all.deb
 and then you can dpkg -i them
 PaidSupport, yes (but with sudo)
 PaidSupport, when that is done try grep 2.6.39 /boot/grub/grub.cfg and see if the kernel is listed there. if not we need to run grub-mkconfig
 diglett, man route
 Stameni, you can't alt-tab to it
 Stameni, i know but can you alt-tab
 PaidSupport, yes no success?
 PaidSupport, well at least we know its not correct in the most recent upstream kernel
 PaidSupport, you could try any of these upstream kernels http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
 PaidSupport, the same process, download the debs, install them, maybe run grub-mkconfig
 PaidSupport, im trying to find the debs from maverick, you could get them off the cd perhaps, but im not sure how the mirrors store stuff
 PaidSupport, since you know those work I would try them next
 its going to be 2.6.37 right?
 i dont remember
 ok 35 then
 PaidSupport, i think this is the most recent http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick-updates/linux-image-2.6.35-28-generic
 PaidSupport, and you will want the matching headers
 PaidSupport, and of course make sure to select the kernel from the boot menu
 timClicks, awk '{ print $1 }'
 timClicks, you can always remember because awk has a beginning middle and end code blocks that need to be in curly braces
 jukebox-zero, the encrypted filesystem is loop mounted back on top of /home/username
 jukebox-zero, so it may duplicate your du count, but its not double the disk usage
 PaidSupport, still there?
 PaidSupport, i think you could skip the header file... just make sure to install it if this works
 PaidSupport, some things may not work correctly without the headers but you should know immediately (as soon as the kernel gets booted) if it detects the backlight
 PaidSupport, and the header files are not architecture specific so there is only one file (no amd64 vs i386)
 nikos719, is plymouth running? (the graphical boot)
 nikos719, can you boot into recovery mode
 nikos719, it would help if you disabled the boot splash to identify the problem
 nikos719, read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Editing%20Menus%20During%20Boot in particular you want to set nosplash instead of splash
 !grub | WindowNumOne
 mr_orange, read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Editing%20Menus%20During%20Boot in particular you want to set nosplash instead of splash
 mr_orange, that should give us a bit more information
 PaidSupport, how about now?
 PaidSupport, excellent
 PaidSupport, you'll want to track down the patch that turns on your backlight by trying a few kernels and finding what ones work and then talking to the kernel team
 otherwise you are stuck on the old kernel forever
 PaidSupport, without the headers some applications won't be able to be installed correctly
 PaidSupport, #ubuntu-kernel also https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel, but you will want to narrow things down to be able to say "this particular kernel works, this one doesn't, this is my hardware" as best you can
 PaidSupport, you've done it enough you see how its not that bad, just a bit of downloading and testing. also please update your launchpad bug (i think someone said that was yours)

 PaidSupport, im done for the night so goodnight and goodluck
