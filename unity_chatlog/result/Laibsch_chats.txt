 Hi, I'm looking for help to get back a working initramfs to boot my encrypted LVM: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/initramfs-tools/+question/154973/
 stefg: Thank you for having a look.  I did the update-initramfs part already but I'm not sure if I reconfigured lvm.  I'll do that.  Let's see if it helps.
 stefg: yes, understood.  Thank you.  I'll have a look
