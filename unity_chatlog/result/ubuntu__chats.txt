 hey, I'm installing ubuntu 11.04 from a USB stick. When I click on the install icon in the live session, it unmounts the hard drive (or, I assume it does, as it goes from my desktop) and, although it's just unmounted it (it's /dev/sda) it asks whether I want to unmount it. Whatever I click, when it gets to the partition screen, it doesn't give me the choice to install it to hd, only the memory stick it's already on.

 hello, i'm getting grub error 17 after freshly installing 11.04 (over an older install). i tried rearranging my hard drives' order in bios, to no avail
 what next?
 aeon-ltd - i'm pretty sure it's picking up an older grub
 cannot boot into 11.04, just blank screen
 Herbs: Incarus6: Sorry, lost connection. My partition table is not proper.. Was tihnking of a way to correct it somehow
 Incarus6: RAM is 4GiB and current swap is more than required
 Incarus6: ok
 Incarus6: Why did you suggest data recovery tool?
 Incarus6: Is there any way i can improve current partition table than doing what I was asking initailly?
