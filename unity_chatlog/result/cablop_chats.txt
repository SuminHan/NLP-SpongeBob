 hello
 i need a suggestion in a software to detect Wireless Networks and the channel they're using, not kismet, kismet is more than what i need, i just need to know, available networks, channels in use and signal strenght, just to help in choosing the wireless channel of a wlan
 let me try
 Sylphid, ActionParsnip will i lost wlan connectivity with that command?
 Sylphid, ActionParsnip thanks a lot
 is there any gui for that? i can use this, but barely i can ask others to use CLI
 any GUI tool able to scan Wireless Networks giving me signal strenght, channel in use, and the like? (iwscan is ok for me, but...)
 vibhav: giving it a look
 vibhav: thanks, i think it is good enough, we can go iwlist when wanted more detail :)
 well guys
 another question
 compared to 10.10 is 10.04 much better or just a few  improvements?
 i mean 11.04
 mmm unity by default? then better i keep in 10.10 for a while... i disliked unity because it had a unable to hide bar at the left
 i just liked the bar was like the win7 taskbar
 i disliked i cannot configure two panels as clasic one on top and below and move their items
 sigh, i'll like the apps left bar with the classic panels and so on xD
 in fact i just want the left bar from unity :P
 any sound or video issues?
 that crappy pulseaudio becomes just noise and cracks and bleeps after a while, but alsa cannot deal tih my mic
 *with
 mmm i see
 afaik the cracky crappy sund it is an issue related to laptops netbooks
 when the kernel uses some event instead of time management in order to save battery
 i always used nvidia drivers in ubuntu
 i mean
 original drivers
 :P
 ubuntu is free but its main focus is be usable rather than OSS
 ActionParsnip: same here :)
 wait
 i want the answer of finding prefs too
 mikebeecham: license terms, meaning you as a person actively enable them
 if thinks are like 10.10 just ticking the active checkbox
 let me check mikebeecham
 why system settings in the shutdown menu????
 MnCC yup it seems unity uses its own windowmanager, not the compiz one
 mikebeecham: afaik you get somehow to the additional drivers panel
 mikebeecham: then select the one you want to enable and click on the activate button, it will disable the free one and enable the restricted driver
 no checkbox, sorry, was confused
 afaik, if you use nvidia you will have a long way to go
 for 10.04 and 10.10 you need to delete nuveau drivers first, then install the nvidia ones
 MnCC not sure, but try installing the CompizFusionIcon, and change settings from there, it'll change the settings for you
 mikebeecham: i did that in 10.10 to enable the nvidia drivers, i removed many nouveau content
 because a broken reference in somepackage makes nouveau lanch and then you cannot use the nvidia drivers
 greylurk, enable all repos, then try again
 TheHackOps: yes, that solves the nvidia thing, but with a cost, each time you upgrade your kernel they recomplie something and your old kernels won't work for gui
 for everyone, i suggest you to install the classic gnome desktop, then tweak it until compiz and drivers are working properly
 then move to unity and make it works
 Nyvenza do that, move to classic gnome and deal with it until compiz works
 Nyvenza not all headers are installed by default
 aetaric i suggest you to install the proprietary ones
 Nyvenza afaik sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop
 the best time was when they launched 6.06, they do a good work to release something with no errors
 after that ubuntu seems to be, try, and deal with it until you got used to what WE believe it is good for you
 but, besides ranting, my suggestion is this to solve all unity and nvidia and compiz issues
 install the classic gnome, you already know it, then configure compiz, drivers and so on until they work, then when everything is working fine move to unity
 give me a second about enabling the old gnome desktop
 to open the classic gnome i think this wpuld be the guide http://ubuntuguide.net/ubuntu-11-04-natty-login-to-classic-gnome-2-desktop
 in fact i tried unity in 10.10 and classic gnome, and, classic gnome saves the more space for you on a netbook screen, unity waste space.... ironically (at least in 10.10)
 Nyvenza check this one http://ubuntuguide.net/ubuntu-11-04-natty-login-to-classic-gnome-2-desktop
 einseenai, afaik... yes
 einseenai recommendation was for me to wait at least one month before tryin to upgrade
 Nyvenza, they replaced the menu for a button with all on it
 check the guide i gave you to get the old menus back
 NyvenZA: check the guide i gave you to get the old menus back
 ok, then let me check it NyvenZA
 NyvenZA: it should be there, in the login called ubuntu classic
 ok Nyvenza, but you are in the classic gnome, the one you know and you can fix it, then, try alt+f1 to reach the menu, or alt+f2 to run apps and run ccsm
 NyvenZA: alternatively you can install compiz fusion icon to select default windows manager and so on
 cannonball, before login reselect ubuntu classic in login menu
 netbook are not going to dissapear
 Nyromith: afaik xubuntu didn't have the support that gnome orkade had, so... i suggest you to use classic ubuntu instead, it is gnome, but gnome works so nice in a netbook
 Nyromith: well at least in Atom netbooks, dunno in arm or eee
 Nyromith: I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 on a Compaq Mini netbook with compiz enabled and classic interface, able o launch a Virtualbox with Windows XP on it and using the whole hard drive encrypted, performance is nice
 Chilaquiles dunno, maybe we don't have that issue, anyway try looking in the menus to see if you disable it by mistake or something
 Chilaquiles: here it is called main toolbar, click it
 Chilaquiles: View > Main Toolbar check it
 Chilaquiles: try reloading window manager or logging off then in again... but it is a weird issue
 and i agree
 MAc people would like new ubuntu's .... anyway mac users got used for OTHERS to decided what's the best for them
 ceo mark it as executable, via Nautilus or chmod
 ceo, anyway, office 2007 will give you some trouble to run on wine, try a virtual machine instead
 CQ check them manually in synaptic (if 11.04 still have it) it depends on your installed kernel and architecture, but you'll find it called linux-headers-XXXXXXX
 TheHackOps: install FlaskBlock for Firefox and for Chrome... i hate flash too xD\

 A_J he is saying hello, not asking to ask :P
 Browser ubuntu 11.04? use main repos for a while until all repos are in sync, it will took a feww weeks or a month depending where you are
 exit
