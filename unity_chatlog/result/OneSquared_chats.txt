 Hello, I need help. I would rename file (637-texte.png --> 637.png) but how ?
 Halzen, There are a lot of file :/ about 248.
 There are a lot of file : 637-texte.png, 6898-look.png, 875458-nick.png, etc..... so I would a dynamic command or script for rename all file.
 I will like use sed but it's difficult...
