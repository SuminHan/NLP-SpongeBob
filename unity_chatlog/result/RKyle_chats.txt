 is it possible to change the owner of a file in /var/www/ for non-admin users to access? I tried sudo chown username -R path but that didn't work
 phoque_uni, I had a directory in /var/www/ I was trying to give access to a non-admin user and the command displayed nothing like it worked
 How would I permanently disable the synatpics touchpad on my laptop?
