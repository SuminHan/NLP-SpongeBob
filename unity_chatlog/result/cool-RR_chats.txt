 Hello!
 I've installed 11.04 on VMWare
 But Unity isn't working
 What can I do?
 LjL: VMWare does have some and I enabled it
 jeija: I guess I'll try VirtualBox
 I'll look into these options
 Thanks everyone for your help!
 Goodbye
 Hello again
 There's something I don't understand how to do in Unity
 I press Super
 Start typing the app name, like "ter"
 But how can I use the keyboard to browse through the different apps?
 Guys, how can I use the keyboard to move between app symbols in Unity?
