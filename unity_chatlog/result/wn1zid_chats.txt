 is there a bounce feature in evolution ?
 Blackflowers-   many people like showing off to new comers, with that ill leave it up to you, ubuntu has the best help community.
 well, i would wipe the drive and put ubuntu in its place and be done with it.
 celthunder-  i entered with Blackflowers  commented on not getting help anywhere for fedora, and this being a ubuntu help only and her being new, i thought best for her to start fresh.
