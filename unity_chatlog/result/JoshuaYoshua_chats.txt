It's just that I've written Ubuntu 11.04 twice now and I have the burning software validate the disc after and I can open it and see or the files... but after I restart it's not detected when booting and when I try to view the files on the disc it doesn't detect anything.
 I can see by physically looking at the disc that it has been written to. So I don't know
 Well the ISO passes the md5 check, checked that
 The burning software in Windows 7
 I will try ImgBurn next, but think it will be the same
 I say this because I had trouble with some other things
