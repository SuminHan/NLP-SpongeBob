 I updated to 11.04 and my nvidia driver on my dell d630 won't work.  I can get command line, but no GUI
 anyone have ideas?
 Caly: NOO!!!!!
 :)
 ActionParsnip: ok
 Caly: did that work?
 Caly: what ActionParsnip suggested
 Caly: what did you do?
 good suggestion
 wahoo failsafe graphics mode!!!
 Caly: Not yet
 Caly: it is still loading
 It is frozen loading at: Checking Battery State
 but i can do alt+f1 to get to a prompt
 Caly: I did failsafe graphics mode to force vesa
 Caly: That sucks
 They really should make an easy way to roll back your version if you need to
 lol
 i am going to program this: sudo dist-downgrade
 I should of just made a drive image
 it would have take an hour and saved me 10
 LOL
 WOOT, failsafe graphics got me in and now I am trying to install nvidia drivers
 Caly: hopefully, I am in the GUI and installing drivers
 Caly: LOL, I have thought about that many many many times
 Caly: ya, and they don't have as many udpates
 Caly: LMAO, you are making me not want to fix my Ubuntu
 LOL
 Caly: OMG It does look like a smart phone
 WTF
 Folks were not in Gnome any longer
