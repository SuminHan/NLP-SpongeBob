 how can i install gnome 3? (and gnome-shell)? just via ppa?
 bakanub: why didn't they include gnome 3? i thought it's stable
 jdahm: well that's apple and oranges. i didn't say so. i just want to know why they didn't include it.
 LjL: ah. that makes sense
 i can select only unity-2d not unity. what do i have to install to have unity in gdm?
