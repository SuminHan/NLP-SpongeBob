 So does anyone know why the mouse won't respond to clicks in 11.04?
 Can anyone point me to the right channel for 11.04 help, or answer my question?
 I'm having a problem where my mouse refuses to click on anything,
 11.04
 sometimes one, somtimes both
 it's acting very finnicky
 I'd like to reinstall 10.10
 11.04 is still buggy as hell
