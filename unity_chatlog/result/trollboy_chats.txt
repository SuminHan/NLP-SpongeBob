 so, is there a handy link on how to customize the new menu bar on ubuntu?
 r0fs3ck5, I just upgraded to 11.04
 Naughty Narwhal?
 [4-tea-2], sorry
 r0fs3ck5, stil in development?  But I thought I got the stable release?
 oh well
 I'll wait
 what about killing the autohide?
 I use synergy and I keep just popping over to the other screen instead of activating the menu?
 is there a way to kill the new mac-like titlebar?  (the titlebar of the application in focus becomes the application bar at the top of the desktop?
 so, I've heard that you can switch the new ubuntu over to default gnome instead of unity, is there a tutorial on how to do this?
 jrib that didn't work
 there was no classic option on login
 so how do I switch to gnome/kill unity whatever?
 There was a keyboard and a handicap symbol
 GDM options do not appear, only a password box when I click my name
 OerHeks, there is no GDM options.  When I click my name, I just get the password box
 I'll try again
 that fixed it
 thanks
 will that be the default now?
