 i think i am the only one on the planet who actually likes Unity :(
 just you epyx
 cyoz1, yeah banshee is slow as well ... i am sticking with rhythmbox
 mictlantecuhtle, i use to get that with banshee
 10.10 is history

 cassio, "Launch CCSM yet again, and select General Options from the category 'General'. Select the tab 'Desktop Size' and choose the values you want. Simple as that."
 sfdsafdsafdsa, ubuntu 11.04 is the Win7 stage - Vista indeed
 cassio, no worries
 anyone find ubuntu doesn't shutdown properly .. just hangs
 chilli0, remove Banshee
 preyas__, but isn't that just for multimedia?
 preyas__, if i were to set the multimedia player to rhythmbox what would happen if i selected a video
 anyone here find that ubuntu doesn't shutdown properly - eg. it freezes
 at last i have got to the bottom of ubuntu freezing on shutdown .. now a happy chappy
 dr3mro, looked through your code and it looks absolutely fine
 Flannel, :)
 NAAAAWW, ubuntu
 slide, strange mine doesn't do that
 just noticed some new updates come through for unity and scrollbar
 elliot_, ditto for me ... best version of Ubuntu yet
 anyone here using clementine and would you recommend it
 GreeNtooTH, 11.04 is very stable on my netbook .. infact it is the first release that works without any tweaks
 really liking the Faenza icon set - fits really nicely with unity
 Simkin, unity will be a success
 Simkin, the pager is simple to use
 Simkin, i loved windowmaker about ten years ago, but things move on and it is no longer viable as a desktop replacement given it is a window manager
 Simkin, just remember how many people hated Windows XP when it came out, and then how much they wanted Windows 7 to be XP when it came out
 Simkin, explain how it is irrelevent
 Simkin, hardly
 Simkin, winxp is not win95's interface
 Simkin, it isn't so .. anyway offtopic as mentioned by zvacet so best end it here
 Simkin, don't ask me gov
 uabn93, works fine with my Intel G945
 Casper76, must be hardware related as it runs like a dream on my netbook that uses an low powered Intel Atom N270 with 2GB of RAM
 Casper76, what video card do you have
 Simkin, click on the workspaces icon
 Simkin, it is an icon with a grid and when you hover your mouse over it it says Workspace Switcher
 Simkin, on mine it is the third one from the bottom
 Simkin, unity dockbar or whatever they call it
 Simkin, howcome?
 Simkin, yeah i miss the preview - just noticed that, so perhaps i didn't miss it that much
 Simkin, it is easier to use though by clicking on it and moving windows between desktops rather than working with a tiny preview pager as was the case in 10.10
 Simkin, yeah i find myself having to depend on keyboard shortcuts and alt+f2 more often
 Simkin, i never really liked gnome2 menus though
 Simkin, KDE 3.5.10 was sublime
 Simkin, i hope they get back on track ... another interface i really liked was Amarok 1.4 and then they ruined it with Amarok 2.0 .. not sure if that has improved, but wish they had left it alone
 tbrew13, i wish unity would flash the icon or something when somebody messages me rather than shake it for a short duration that i might miss
