 Evening folks, I can't seem to get my atheros wireless nic to connect to my router and I've tried everything I could think of and/or google.  No errors, iwlist scanning shows the router just fine, but I can't connect in terminal.
 MrBean : have you tried reducing your graphic settings to the bare min for that VNC connetion?
 MrBean: yea when I was living in Colombia connecting to my VNC in Canada I had to do that to ge tit to work
 So anyone feel like helping me troubleshoot this wireless network problem?  Everything connected fine in 10.04 from inside xserver but now in 11.04 without xserver I can see the AP but I just can't connect to it :(
 oh my god this new GUI setup for 11.04 is hurting my brain.. how do I turn this mac-esque carebare deisgn off and go back to what it was in 10.04?
 ActionParsnip: yea, I have a panel too, that part I like.. the rest, my god.
 Thank goodness
 thanks for the heads up.. the pressure is slowly releasing from my head at having to try to manage through that gui.
