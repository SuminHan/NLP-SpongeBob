 hello?
 where can I find on the ubuntu website a place to order an installation disk like in 10.10?
 is 11 worth it?
 I have 10.10, is it easy to transition? (and i dont mean to install)
 can unity be disabled?
 <sebsebseb> hard to get used to for some reason, and I had my menus set up very well
 sebsebseb: thanks (x
 is chrome running on 11.04?
 yes
 i  use the dev version of g chrome. what about that.
 didn't oracle stop making OOo?
