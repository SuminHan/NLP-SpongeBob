 Does anyone know why the ubuntu theme engine crashes whenever gnome OR unity runs in virtualbox?
 Kyle__, it happens regardless of whether I have 3d enabled, and it even happens when I go into gnome classic
 Kyle__ not if you select (no effects)
 stefg I have 4.0.6 and 4.0.6 guest additions
 Kyle__ i did install them
 Kyle__ quite frankly, I have never personally gotten ubuntu to run reliably in virtualbox
 stefg it happens even when I am not using 3d acceleration and even when the effects are turned off
 stefg yeah, the ubuntu theme engine crashes and it falls back on this gray ugly theme
 stefg as I said, it appears to be independent of anything related to 3d
 stefg
 stefg okay, well, clearly something is different about your system
 stefg you are on virtualbox right?
 stefg well how do we find out what it is?
 stefg I have OSX as host
 stefg what is that?
