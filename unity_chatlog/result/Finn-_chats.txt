 Gentlemen. I just updated to 11.04, and now as I boot and login, my desktop is not loading. I had this problem before, but solved it with the uninstallation of compiz. However, it is not installed, and the problem is back. Any ideas?
 I only get the Ubuntu Desktop guide, bun none of the keyboard shortcuts work.
 Ah, selecting "Gnome classic" seems to work. Now I just have to make sure that it selects it automatically the next time, or at least until Unity is fixed for me.
 most excellent
 thanks for the mental support, if nothing else :)   bye~
