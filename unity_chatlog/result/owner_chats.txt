 hey can anyone help me. I have tried to get Blender 2.57b to work with openshot in Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04 and so far it won't work.
 I'm running 11.04 too
 OpenShot video editor wants Blender 2.57b installed in order for it to do the CGI stuff.
 I tried going into prefrences and telling OpenShot where the new blender executable was but it won't do it.
 I hate unity.
 ohsix I asked how to get OpenShot video editor to work with Blender 2.57b
 ohsix even if you go into prefrences and point it at the executable for Blender 2.57b it won't work.
 No one knows what to say. Here is what I need to know ohsix. I need to know where to stick the files in the package for Blender 2.57b so that they will replace the outdated version.
 Ya unity is like using an iphone or droid.
 I'm copying all the files into /usr/bin maybe that will work.
 WHA HA HA HA HA I FIXED IT!
 And no one else has
 :D
