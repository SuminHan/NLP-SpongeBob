 armor-64: ask in #ubuntu+1
 hiexpo: cache of what?
 hiexpo: do you mean swap space? If you flush the ram then the system will cease to be
 hiexpo: can you give the output of:   free -m
 hiexpo: when it's high, rerun it
 hiexpo: you are only using 550Mb. You have 1884Mb available and have 1360Mb free
 hiexpo: if its only cache then its fine, unused ram is wasted ram
 hiexpo: just watch the right hand value on the "-/+ buffers/cache" line
 hiexpo: that is the actual free ram
 linuxman410: run:  sudo lshw -C display     websearch for the product line to find guides. You may need an xorg.conf to make it work ok
 !11.04
 Vorenii: ^
 Roydi: europe spans MANY timezones
 ssfdre38: ask in #ubuntu+1 natty isofftopic here
 Roydi: ask in #ubuntu+1 natty is offtopic here
 itguru: it's the day after WEDNESADY
 itguru: welcome to the calendar
 itguru: true, but not yet
 reeceb: run:  lsusb   use the 8 character hex id to find guides. Logitech refuse to support linux so I suggest you avoid their products
 xiambax: loading apps and the OS will improve
 itguru: all that is moot, depends when the servers get updated
 itguru: 11.04 here ;)
 reeceb: thats just the ID, use it to find uides
 *guides
 zzecool: please don't away like that
 robert05ad: I've had it since alpha 2
 KaAtta: the file needs creating, you ca find sample files on the web
 KaAtta: .conkyrc is a file, not a folder
 katsrc: you need to extract the folder then run the commands on http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/conky_grey?content=137272
 hiexpo: there's a method listed on the page above
 hiexpo: if you read the link, it gives instructions to run, so conkyrc isnt needed
 hiexpo: it works so I don't argue with it
 armor-64: ask in #ubuntu+1
 zniavre: what video chip do you use?
 aLky: is this a clean install or an upgrade?
 aLky: are you using natty?
 ubuntutryout777: what video chip are you using?
 JohnFlux: it's natty
 ubuntutryout777: then install nvidia-current then restart the X server, you will be able to run unity
 aLky: your call dude, all you need are the nvidia drivers installing
 Incarus6: sure it is, if you have 3D accelleration you can run Unity
 mah454: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/dvd/current/
 coz_: its released today so won't it be the same thing?
 Incarus6: nowhere on that page does it say Unity isn't supported on proprietary drivers
 Incarus6: its users saying if you want 3d effects you will need proprietary
 Lungan: if you boot to regular desktop then make the unity bar you can change the top bar
 trans: have you installed 3D drivers. also make sure you are fully upgraded
 Incarus6: :)
 Khr0n0s: is it an upgrade or a clean install?
 Khr0n0s: remove the proprietary driver, reboot, install the proprietary driver and reboot, should be ok
 saml: ctrl+alt+cursors
 saml: then you will need to expand the number of desktops in ccsm
 saml: yes, set the horizontal and vertical workplace value to 1
 saml: then you need to reinstate 3D accelleration
 LukasIgnat: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get -y upgrade
 saml: what video chip are you using?
 saml: which model?
 saml: remove the driver, reboot, install the driver then reinstall the driver
 brianl: do a clean install of natty instead :)
 zetheroo: which menu?
 brianl: does it show in:  sudo lshw -C network
 zetheroo: I think it just uses the files in /usr/share/applications
 niels1: use the bootoption:   nomodeset     If you use an nvidia/ati video chip then install the proprietary driver and it should be enableable
 jdahm: 11.04 isn't LTS
 niels1: what video chip are you using?
 brianl: can't see that being an issue
 brianl: is there a switch to turn the wifi off and on
 brianl: reboot and run:  dmesg | less     and read through, is the wireless device detected?
 cholo: depends when you last updated the OS
 Toph: there is no single best application for any one situation in any OS
 Toph: best is an opinion based on needs and tastes, why not try a few yourselfand use what YOU think is best
 byomkeshbakshi: did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded
 cholo: when you install upgrades you will be on the stable release
 gl vibhav
 byomkeshbakshi: then how do you know it was consistent or complete?
 brianl: and that's in a Lucid install
 brianl: very strange
 cholo: upgrade or dist-uprade from beta2 and you will have the stable releasae
 byomkeshbakshi: without knowing if the image you have is good, you are wasting your time
 !md5 | byomkeshbakshi
 eigba: why do you need opinions? Do you want to  be told what to thhink?
 eigba: it'sok. I suggest you install it and use it, you can always remove it
 eigba: it smells the same
 eigba: its a small download and easy to remove, try it and youo might like it
 MK``: been fine here for months
 Monotoko: lots of seeders ;)
 hsh902: yes
 Monotoko: its one seed I always keep, Everything else I give 1 back. I also have a tiny text doc from a snes rom file to show idiots that ratio is worthless
 Monotoko: you could add the torrent and get the file created, then kill the app and replace the partial file with the completed file, you will then seed it
 brianl: cool, I suggest you go into device manager and tell windows to not allow the device to wake up the OS, and disable power management on it
 exchgr: all mirrors will be "slooooow", it's release day. Think about it
 nick87720z: you will either need to upgrade to maverick, then to natty OR do a clean install of natty
 exchgr: i'd say they will ALL be slow as a LOT of users are upgrading. If you torrent the alternate natty ISO you can do an offline upgrade but you will then need to upgrade natty to the latest packages which will take more time
 exchgr: true, I use apt-fast, it's sweeet
 Lars_G: yes
 biffbaxter: wanna bet
 biffbaxter: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
 Lars_G: check /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 Holek: how do you mean?
 !hashes
 jatt: http://releases.ubuntu.com/natty/MD5SUMS
 jatt: I'll see if I can update it
 Holek: then use your own backups, or just resetup the WM
 !info azureus
 yxz97: azureus is in the repos
 Holek: then all I can sugest is you reset it up, I also suggest you review your backup regime to include the compiz settings
 phoque_uni: each process can use more than 4Gb RAM, extra features enabled in the CPU
 phoque_uni: heavy computatinal thins like video encoding will be faster, regular desktop stuff will not see any noticable speed change
 arand: for standard desktop stuff the increase is negligible
 Holek: emerald is no longer maintained
 phoque_uni: ask in ##hardware
 Holek: ccsm or simple-ccsm
 Holek: not sure about "themes" it usually uses the GTK theme you set
 Roasted_: press ALT+F2   and run:  r      may help
 Roasted_: yeah, should reset things (works in debian), or just restart X server
 Roasted_: the X server, may help
 nitroxidus: just run your upgrades and you will get it
 The-Kernel_: remove unnecessary kernels to save lots of space
 Wickk: what video chip?
 Wickk: did you try removing the proprietary driver then reinstalling it after a reboot?
 Holek: then install emerald and run:   emerald --replace
 Holek: I don't theme much, it really doesn't interest me so you are asking the wrong guy
 Holek: try renaming the folder holding the emerald config
 mang0: you don't mount drives, you mount partitions
 mang0: did you test the CD for defects wen it started to boot?
 cdavis: do you mean the unity panel on the left or the top panel?
 Holek: try the emerald irc channel (if they have one), or ask in #compiz
 cdavis: not sure, as far asa I've seen its not very changable, if you boot to the normal desktop and start unity then you may be able to add stuff
 The-Kernel_: no, I suggest you remove the oldest ones, you only really need 2, each kernel is about 120Mb
 burg: did you specify the network parameters for the wired link in /etc/network/interfaces by any chance?
 marel: sudo -i
 other_max: been fine here since alpha 2
 agrab: radeon, radeonhd, ati and frglrx
 other_max: try LXDE :)
 agrab: depends on needs
 agrab: for most things the open source driver is fine, if you need full 3D goodness (an your chip is supported by it) then the frglrx driver will be needed
 !info libavdevice52 maverick | Incarus6
 Incarus6: it says its in the main repo, if you enable the updates one it may be different, I'm on Natty presently
 SoftTimur: you don't run about:config in dash, you use it in browsers..
 SoftTimur: about:config is used in web browsrs to show config, if you run it in an ALT+F2 dialogue it won't do anything (as far as I am aware0
 Incarus6: you could remove openoffice until the update is done, it will reduce downloaded apps as well as errors
 SoftTimur: you can run:    firefox about:config
 !tor
 SoftTimur: how about if you type it in the address bar of the browser?
 NyvenZA: what video chip do you use?
 SoftTimur: strange, usually it does: http://www.askdavetaylor.com/1-blog-pics/firefox-about-config.png   something like that
 NyvenZA: remove the proprietary driver, reboot then install the driver and reboot again
 Igashu: I always clean install
 NyvenZA: you may want to run:  sudo nvidia-xconfig   then restart X
 SoftTimur: i've never ran it from ALT+F2, always from with the browser
 dennda: works here, clean install natty
 rpk: you may need to add the config in apt.conf
 rpk: in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy     put     Acquire::http::Proxy "http://proxy:8080";
 usr13: i've hadto add it in the past, then i stopped using proxy
 usr13: rpk: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/synaptic/+question/1320
 usr13: i guess, I used polipo, nice and simple
 hodges: it's natty, not nutty
 hodges: its stuck on the left now, it may be movablelater
 dennda: does the button flash if you use thesuper key to launch the app?
 rpk: i see
 usr13: ping uses a different protocol so may be different
 Vhozard: add it in /etc/default/grub in the quotes with:  quiet splash
 Vhozard: then run: sudo update-grub
 Vhozard: grub2 doesn't use that now, editting the grub file will add the option to all future kernels for you
 rpk: then add the ppa in /etc/apt/sources.list    then manually import the key
 dennda: not sure, could log it
 rpk: if you go to the ppa page, you'll see the key and you can copy / paste the text to a file then run:  sudo apt-key add file
 rpk: well you have a workaround til it gets sorted
 chadi: if it hasn't finished then you will have half an OS
 rpk: yikes
 rpk: glad I stopped using a proxy
 shane4ubuntu1: on the buddy list window or the channel window?
 shane4ubuntu1: yeah I've got one on the main window as well as the user list
 shane4ubuntu1: i'm using uity though
 rpk: i see, then all I can suggest is use the workaround
 shane4ubuntu1: nice
 NyvenZA: yes
 koichirose: set a new theme and it should be ok
 koichirose: no, the issue is with firefox, so you need a firefox theme.If you keep to the context of the question, that would have been clear
 NyvenZA: what video chip are you using?
 Skei: http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/
 NyvenZA: install nvidia-current and it will be fine after a reboot
 agonzalez: try:  sudo nvidia-xconfig    andreboot
 Osmodivs: yes thats not the command
 NyvenZA: then try: nvidia-173
 NyvenZA: try: sudo apt-get install nvidia-173    may help
 !upgrade | Osmodivs
 Osmodivs: instead of trying to guess, why not read the upgrade documentation
 NyvenZA: udev will make it so
 Osmodivs: there is the server method listed, use that
 !download
 Osmodivs: yes but the server method uses cli as that is all it has, no x server
 Osmodivs: sudo apt-get install update-manager-core; sudo do-release-upgrade
 Osmodivs: copied and pasted from: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NattyUpgrades
 Skei: coolio
 Skei: your call, gl
 rpk: did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
 rpk: and memory test?
 rpk: in the livecd, update the gparted and ubiquity packaes from the repos, may help
 rpk: yeah it may solve bugs and such
 rpk: maybe updates will help
 rpk: no worries dude :)
 jdahm: make a launcher for it then drag the launcher to the dock
 jdahm: use alacarte or right click desktop
 adelie42: same method, use alacarte
 lacrymology: sudo lshw -C display
 cablop: sudo iwlist scan     will show all that
 lacrymology: yes
 lacrymology: the open drivers are nv and nouveau
 jdahm: when you run it, right click the app and select "Keep in launcher"
 venik: do you have "ubuntu-desktop" package installed/
 venik: that's why then, you need the metapackage to be able to update
 venik: i see, i believe it's needed so the updater knows what is going on
 jdahm: strange
 Skei: no worries :)
 Janusman: try:  sudo update-grub    do you see the new kernel listed/
 Janusman: np man
 cablop: you can boot to a traditional desktop if you want....default means nothing
 eiriksvin: do you have one of those switchable video chips?
 eiriksvin: may need to run:  sudo nvidia-xconfig
 cablop: I just use what gets the job done. I don't care if its OSS or not
 eiriksvin: then install the nvidia driver from the repo
 TheHackOps: don't use it then
 TheHackOps: you can use classic desktop if you dislike unity
 floop_: install nvidia-current and reboot, failing that, install nvidia-173    and reboot
 TheHackOps: I don't see an issue personally
 TheHackOps: mind you, I use a lot of LXDE these days
 tarunno: i don't see how the two are linked
 !upgrade | abhishek
 tarunno: the lack of netbook and the torrent you can download ubuntu with
 dd214: what is CAC?
 TheHackOps: ccsm with sudo isn't a good idea
 tarunno: I always use: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/11.04/release/
 TheHackOps: sudo isn't to be used with GUI apps, use gksudo
 TheHackOps: sudo will run it as root, which won't change the users settings, it will change root
 tarunno: I use torrents, much faster and allows you to give back to the community
 tarunno: same sort of deal
 tarunno: using torrents in the first instance means less faff
 rcmaehl: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+bugs  says 329 bugs in Natty
 TheHackOps: its fine here on my Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS  as well as my desktop system on Nvidia 6150 onboard
 TheHackOps: are you running 64bit OS?
 mah454: you can use classic desktop if you wish
 TheHackOps: tried 64bit flash?
 kcin1: check on the skype site
 TheHackOps: there is a ppa with 64bit flash on the omgubuntu site
 TheHackOps: its the smae file for ALL browsers, not just firefox
 TheHackOps: works fine here
 kcin1: then no, its only for those
 kcin1: skype is proprietary so you will only get it if skype make it
 kcin1: then try using it in some way
 A_J: what does "reffer" mean?
 A_J: you can boot to it to help fix things, if thats what you mean....
 eigba: its ok
 DasEi: oh i see
 A_J: they will be pretty much the same
 A_J: you should have a backup ANYWAY
 A_J: what if a drive motor fails, where is your data?
 A_J: you will be paying thosands for professional and non-garunteed data retrieval, contrast with a couple hundrd for some USB storages....
 A_J: raid 0 isn't needed, raid 0 gives spped, not capacity
 A_J: I just found some 3Tb NAS for 120 GBP, pretty cheap. Is your data worth that?
 ceo: chmod +x home/ceo/Desktop/Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise/setup.exe; wine home/ceo/Desktop/Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise/setup.exe

 mikebeecham: if you don't have 3D accelleration, youo won't get Unity
 TheHackOps: what video chip are you using?
 mikebeecham: what is the output of:  lspci | grep -i vga
 TheHackOps: if you are using the proprietary driver it should be ok
 acidflash: remove squid from the startup apps and then add the command to run squid as you desire in /etc/rc.local
 mikebeecham: ok under the system -> admin menu there is the hardware driver installer, tell it to install the nvidia driver and reboot, you'll have nice 3d accell and you'llbe able to boot to unity
 Somelauw: if what you have works, why fix it
 Kyubey: can you give the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && bash ./alsa-info.sh
 ohsix: if you want, the output is dead handy though
 a2c4n9e1: add it in /etc/fstab
 a2c4n9e1: run:  sudo blkid
 samtate: what make and model is the system?
 phibxr: because natty is released
 Kyubey: what is the output of:  uname -a; lsb_release -a; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf

 Kyubey: ok try flash
 FunnyLookinHat: what'swrong with it?
 Kyubey: sweet, thought you were only missing sound in flash
 FunnyLookinHat: the image
 banderl0g: run updates, no updates mean it is stable
 FunnyLookinHat: then replace gnome-panel in your gconf-editor to be something else and it will go, you need the panel to hold thefile, edit menus of each app unless you make the system put them in the traditional place
 samtate: (21:55:26) ActionParsnip: samtate: try adding: options snd-hda-intel model=thinkpad     to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf      and reboot, may help

 _Mr_Proper_: you ot seen that link?
 *not
 _Mr_Proper_: not websearched before asking? I found that in a matter of seconds..
 samtate: try model=laptop  instead
 _Mr_Proper_: simple stuff.all I searched for was: ubuntu blue tint in video
 samtate: ok try: options snd-hda-intel position_fix=1       instead
 samtate: yes, remove the one you tried before each time
 Kyubey: if you use sudo as little as possible, you won't break file ownerships
 haroon: please use one line
 samtate_: do you reboot in between?
 samtate_: hehe, all I can recommend is you find the option you need for your make and model system
 samtate_: most are just intel compatible things, there is an alsa-info script on the sound troubleshooting documentation, it will tell you a lot
 !es | resumenes
 tauntaun: use soundjuicer
 tauntaun: or you can use rhythmnbox or banshee to put songs onto it
 tauntaun: some versions of itunes will run in some versions of wine
 conical: not at all, it will speed up the web :)
 conical: I put a dns server on allmy systems as tey will cache resolutions, speed up the web nicely
 pattysmatty: keep it family friendly please
 conical: you'd tell yoursystems to use the DNS system first, you can set interfaces to DHCP (address only)
 conical: could install a caching proxy too so you don't have to download from the web when you need content if  the newest files are stored already
 pattysmatty: no idea, I don't use it
 samtate: do you have the alsa link it made?
 samtate: you ran the alsa-info script, right?
 samtate: what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && bash ./alsa-info.sh
 AndrewEMT: You may need to run:  sudo nvidia-xconfig
 samtate: try:options snd-hda-intel model=auto
 samtate: or options snd-hda-intel model=laptop
 samtate: then try the first.,...
 AndrewEMT: you can restart X or reboot
 AaeRohn: askaway
 Rockj: press Winkey + D
 Rockj: There is a custom command section, you may be able to put a code in one then assign a shortcut to run that command. I'd ask in #compiz

 cache_surplus: how did you make the install CD?
 samtate_: alsa-base.conf then the model of your system
 cache_surplus: i see, maybe you need a bootoption. Is the system a branded PC or laptop
 n3glv: did you use the alternate cd?
 cache_surplus: what make and model is the system?
 n3glv: then that won't work. The upgrade doc clearly states you need the alternate cd
 cache_surplus: what model satelite?
 n3glv: researching is useful
 n3glv: if you want to clean install you have the right cd
 computergeeksjw: add the bootoption:  modulename.blacklist=1
 cache_surplus: try setting the sata to ide mode, look in BIOS for options
 lucas: its not, if one exists it will be obeyed
 cache_surplus: if you also try the boot option:  noacpi   it may help
 Neosano: which release ?

 ohsix: works great here :)
 cache_surplus: did you try the boot option?
 cache_surplus: could try booting usb instead
 ohsix: only got one monitor for 4 PCs
 ohsix: I use xorg.conf, yes
 ohsix: no, it works well
 ohsix: the xorg.cof file is older than ubuntu, it works well so I use it :)
 testbe: it is
 rgr: i know its not obsolete.  preeching to the choir dude
 Maxud: you will need to pull down the deb for the deb, extract the file and copy .so file to /usr/lib32
 jeff__: if the default packages can give 3d accelleration then compiz will be used
 ohsix: I only use one mode
 ohsix: yes, it needs one. Its an old monitor
 jon_gee: do you have an onboard video chip and an agp / PCIexpress video card
 Caly: run:  sudo apt-get -f install
 Caly: boot to root recovery mode, or chroot from livecd
 computergeeksjw: modulename.blacklist=1

 truepurple: the command is:  which tomboy
 dibs: can you give the output of: sudo do-release-upgrade
 dark-matter: uninstall the nvidia driver, boot then reinstall the driver then reboot
 truepurple: then thats the binary, is that not what you wanted?
 truepurple: yes the binary is the actual file executed when you run the command
 coolkid25: hardly
 relik: check case
 coolkid25: if you boot to livecd, chroot to the installed OS and manipulate grub
 relik: try:   ls | grep -i ".mpg"   ,ay work
 coolkid25: its the CD you installed with
 truepurple: there are search apps. I'm unclear as to what you are after
 work: if you unload the module driving it, it will cease to work
 coolkid25: then download the ISO, MD5 test it then make a bootable USB or burn it to CD
 truepurple: there are search apps like beagle
 coolkid25: boot to it
 !info beagle | truepurple
 hmm
 coolkid25: boot to the cd you burn
 truepurple: I believe nautilus has one.I always use the find command in CLI
 coolkid25: how do you mean?
 truepurple: in nautilus, little magnifying glass icon...
 Mahjongg: I'd wait a while then, wait for the early bugs to be knockedout
 work: if you run:  lsmod     what is output, use a pastebin to host the text
 Mahjongg: sounds reasonable
 truepurple: check the hardware app. I don't use ati chips
 truepurple: in system -> administration. Instead of asking almost immediately, try a little research so you find out maybe for yourself.You will be moreautonomous
 Mahjongg: you fixed what wasn't broken. On production systems I would always use the LTS
 coolkid25: you need the livecd which is what I was telling you before, remember
 truepurple: sure but now you have new information
 bencc: http://www.multimediaboom.com/how-to-install-java-in-ubuntu-11-04-natty-narwhal-ppa/
 truepurple: about the hardware driver app:  23:53:56) ActionParsnip: truepurple: in system -> administration
 work: if you can give the output of the command I gave, I can advise
 truepurple: in that menu there is an application to install 3rd party drivers
 work: lsmod    I did say earlier
 work: use a pastebin to host the output
 truepurple: thats all I know
 !downgrade | dark-matter
 pseubodot: you may need an xorg.conf file
 pseubodot: it may be necessary if you can't get it in other ways
 !downgrade | daniel_
 CryptoSec: add the clamav ppa
 CryptoSec: search an ye shall find
 pseubodot: thats the only way I can think of, maybe there are other ways but I'm not sure
 coolkid25: you want the desktop ISO and burn it slowly to a CD or copy to USB stick using unetbootin etc
 coolkid25: remember to MD5 sum
 kwtm: how do you mean?
 coolkid25: then Ive no idea. I dislike wubi and have no knowledge of it. The liveCD method may not work
 Random832: you can make it
 coolkid25: try it cd. I'm not sure if you can do this with wubi. You have a lot more work to do because you used wubi
 kwtm: debian gives an option of a seperate /home partition in an easily selectable option
 christhecoolboy: what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && bash ./alsa-info.sh
 kwtm: not currently but users can usemanual partitioning and achieve it
 coolkid25: what isn't an option?
 kwtm: you may be able to script stuffI guess
 christhecoolboy: ok then run:  sudo  apt-get install pastebinit; pastebinit /tmp/alsa-info.txt.SBN7Yihi7e
 christhecoolboy: that file is on your PC only and I don't have access to it. The pastebin will make a url, what is it?
 coolkid25: natty will be fine
 !girls
 !natty | coolkid25
 christhecoolboy: add:   options snd-hda-intel model=auto    to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
 coolkid25: its fine
 christhecoolboy: you need an option like that, could try model=laptop
 coolkid25: 32bit will be an easier life
 christhecoolboy: try model=laptop  or   model=generic
 BKTech86: boot to livecd and reinstate the bootloader
 BKTech86: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
 christhecoolboy: yes but the mic is PART of the soundcard
 BKTech86: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6fpIe-QnVE
 christhecoolboy: so its a seperate device?
 christhecoolboy: ok then check in sound options and switch the mic device to the one on the webcam
 christhecoolboy: then run: lsusb     search for the 8 character hex ID and you may find guides
 christhecoolboy: yikes
 christhecoolboy: not a good idea to invite strangers to your system
 christhecoolboy: if lsusb just hangs then that may be part of the issue
 truepurple: depends on needs and taste
 truepurple: there is no single best solution for anything
 truepurple: if you need full 3D goodness for games and the like then use the proprietary, if you just need basic desktop based stuff then the open drivers are fine
 truepurple: you can use the additional drivers app
 ubd: you can use xorg.conf to set the driver
 christhecoolboy: if you run:  alsamixer    is the mic muted?
 ubd: I'd say install ubuntu and openbox then set the xorg.conf and restart X and it will be used
 truepurple: not sure, I avoid Ati like the plague
 christhecoolboy: then use cursors and M to navigate and unmute it
 christhecoolboy: use Q or ESC to close alsamixer
 christhecoolboy: M, like I said
 christhecoolboy: does the mic work in sound recorder though?
 christhecoolboy: sure
 Senix: press ALT+F2 and run:  metacity --replace     to disable and:  compiz --replace     to eable
 christhecoolboy: not sure man
 coolkid25: no, just md5 test it and burn it slowly to a cd
 coolkid25: it'snot, your dumb OS makes it look like one because winrar can handle the file, that's all
 coolkid25: did you download the DVD ISO?
 coolkid25: then no, you will need a CD media or the DVD ISO
 coolkid25: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/natty/release/ has the dvd
 coolkid25: instead of asking basic questions, try searching a little
 truepurple: they didn't support linux for a long time, nvidia have beeen doing it for ages and do it well, so I use them
 truepurple: also seen too many issues with them and seen few with nvidia
 coolkid25: yes
 truepurple: its a case of !wfm. I back nvidia so I buy their stuff
 BKTech86: i'm no good with grub dude
 BKTech86: I single boot linux so have had nothing to do with it except adding boot options
 christhecoolboy: how?
 christhecoolboy: is the webcam inbuilt to the system?
 j_anon1: plug it in and it willmount, assuming it was safetly removed last time it was unplugged
 j_anon1: when you last used it successfully, how did you remove it from the system?
 christhecoolboy: you'll most likely find that its part of the soundcard, not the webcam
 christhecoolboy: you'll nee dto investigate, having 2 mics on a system like that would be really silly
 christhecoolboy: not sure then, sounds like a mess. Got a wired mic to plug into the micport ust for the now?
 christhecoolboy: then I've no more solutions. My sound always just works because I shop smart
 christhecoolboy: others may be able to advise, but you said there was a hole to plug in a mic, find an external mic and use that
 christhecoolboy: no worries man
 Blake_: what happens when you try and boot the natty kernel?
 !backup
 Blake_: press ESC when plymouth shows, you will see the boot messages,what does it say?
 unc0nn3ct3d: mac has the panel at the bottom
 unc0nn3ct3d: log off, select your name, then change the desktop you log in to at the bottom
 Blake_: ok then run:  sudolshw -C network   use the product line to find guides
 altearius: i'd just run the apps yu want rather than thefull desktop
 Blake_: well you changed your system in a huge way, so it will be affected, its a regression bug
 altearius: dmesg | less
 altearius: or run:   gnome-system-log &
 altearius: all i did was grep the .desktop file and it shows the command it runs
 Blake_: you may find the new kernel is ok once you get a desktop
 hiexpo: ?
 Blake_: I though you said you upgraded to natty? SO why is the install disk part of the equation
 fr00g: in power settings you can enable/disable it
 !broadcom | magicka
 Blake_: do you dual boot?
 Blake_: boot to windows, enable the nic then boot ubuntu, should be ok
 argon: if you disable compiz and use metacity, is it nicer?
 !info chromium-browser-l10n
 yfk: make sure you have universe repo enabled
 yfk: you can also add the chromium daily ppa and get the daily build
 argon: press aLT+F2 and run:  metacity --replace
 argon: instead of asking, you could have researched instead
 rgr: yeah its a big annoyance :(
 ohsix: why is firefox recommended over chromium, or for that fact any other browser?
 LjL: if someone gives direction then users can use that to aid research rather than _immediately_ asking for additional information
 ohsix: chromium is in the repo so is equally supported as firefox...
 LjL: either wayif users can be more autonomous, it helps a lot
 ohsix: thats exactly what supported here means, it is in the official ubuntu repos, so again, why is firefox recommended and chromium not (as you say)?
 LjL: they are equally supported dude
 LjL: yes, and WE are the community, so we support both
 econdudeawesome: can you give the output of:   uname -a; lsb_release -a; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf
 argon: press ALT+F2 and run:  compiz --replace
 argon: then run it from a terminal
 ohsix: so if a user asks for support for chromium-browser package then it will get the same level of support as firefox gets
 LjL: thats sad
 ljl: that's alomost like forcing users to use firefox as they are using a 'lesser' browser
 econdudeawesome: sudo apt-get --purge remove flashplugin-installer     does it remove it?
 ohsix: I support the ALL package which are in the official repos, simple. I don't rank them because one is in a different repo, thats just pathetic
 LjL:so both are equally supported
 ohsix: the main part there is "but aren't in the repos". I only support apps in the official repos here, both chromium and firefox are in the official repos, so they both getequal support
 econdudeawesome: can you pastebin the result please
 ohsix: the community supports the universe repos, as LjL said, we ARE the community and so we support both equally
 rgr: i support both, I mainly uses arora these days personally as I have branched out and researched into other browsers :)
 econdudeawesome: what is the output of: fuser -v /var/cache/debconf/config.dat
 econdudeawesome: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/debconf/+bug/349469   has a fix, I've not used it. I suggest youo MOVE the files instead of deleting
 econdudeawesome: read the bug, instead of deleting as the text says, move the files. This gives a rollback path
 econdudeawesome: in the link I gave, read it
 econdudeawesome: no worries
 econdudeawesome: the bug fix apparently is the move the files out of the folder and run a command, its on the bug
 econdudeawesome: assumedly so, I advise you move them so you can move them back if you get issue
 enav: noip2
 enav: howdy
 enav: its fun
 econdudeawesome: ok have the files been recreated?
 econdudeawesome: then you may need to boot to root recovery mode and copy back if you have not an interactive sudo going
 cousin_mario: ALT+F2 and run: gnome-volume-control
 Edd: installed flawlessly here
 herol3oy: dist-upgrade won't give you natty
 Edd: do you boot to a black screen?
 Edd: add the bootoption: nomodeset
 Glycan_: press ALT+F2 and type the thing you want to run, it will suggest things as you type
 Edd: should do
 ebiester: boot to root recovery mode and run: Xorg -configure and it will make a vanilla file, you can copy it to /etc/X11 and it may help
 Edd: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-fix-ubuntu-10-04-lts-lucid-blank-screen-at-startup.html
 ohsix: ubuntu server uses smb.conf to configure shares....
 Edd: yes it should help
 ohsix: well in this century people use ubuntu server, so "what do you need a .conf for" is one reply
 ohsix: my monitor needs xorg.conf too
 lsv: add the boot option "text"
 ohsix: neither is asking why do they need a .conf
 pattysmatty: do you want to know what rss is or do you want to know some possible app names ?
 lsv: yes add it in /etc/default/grub   in the quotes with: quiet splash
 ohsix: then you answered your own question
 pattysmatty: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/list-of-rss-readers-available-in-ubuntu.html
 lsv: you will need to run:  sudo update-grub   after adding it
 ohsix: your call
 lsv: looks great
 hiexpo: you can make the folder owned by your user only, then you will only have access if you chmod 600 it
 lsv: no, the options are only added to the linux kernels as far as I know
 herol3oy: the upgrade online will use the most recent debs, using the alternate ISO willonly give you the version on the cD, you will then need to upgrade online
 kjxl9: it doesn't give feedback,just type it and hit enter
 Edd: do you not mean ubuntu?
 Edd: you don't have to use plymouth
 Edd: remove the bootoptions: quiet splash      and you will boot in text mode
 Edd: yes it will boot in text mode, then load the desktop
 Edd: gdm will load once the system has fully booted
 Edd: you just won't see plymouth
 !firewall | Guest46633
 Edd: then boot with plymouth loading and press ESC and you will see the boot messages, what are the last few messages?
 rgr: firestarter is just abother gui to iptables
 Edd: anything above that?
 christhecoolboy: sup?
 christhecoolboy: not sure man, i'm rubbish with sound issues
 ohsix: must've missed the question, watching some youtube fun and games now so popping in and out
 !ask | Ultimate_Chaos
 christhecoolboy: guys in here may
 adzy: if you type their nick at the start of aline it will highlight for them
 merlin2049er: which nvidia chip?
 Ultimate_Chaos: you have typed a lot and so far told us nothing
 Ultimate_Chaos: its released so is officially released so is 'stable'
 merlin2049er: sudo apt-get Install nvidia-current
 Ultimate_Chaos: if you don't have 3D accelleration and compiz running it will not start
 Ultimate_Chaos: unity needs it
 yfk: its in the keyboard settings under the options button
 asdf_msc: check the appdb, there is a guide there
 !appdb | asdf_msc
 FearXFactorX: this channel is for ubuntu support only
 JunK-Y: press ALT+F2 and run:  metacity --replace

 econdudeawesome: I also use 64bit flash ;)
 java sorry
 Soothsayer: docky on one, unity on another
 Soothsayer: no idea, I have 1 monitor for 6 systems
 Soothsayer: laptop uses unity (single screen), Media Centre goes to tV (single screen), rest are headless servers
 stercor: or ##networking
 kfizz: you can add .desktop files in ~/.config/autostart
 kfizz: you can add scripts and suck in KDE using the folder ~/.kde/Autorun
 abbronzato: did you test your RAM?
 Ultimate_Chaos: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get -y upgrade
 kfizz: then ~/.config/autostart
 kfizz: you can symlink (or copy or create) .desktop files in that folder and they will run on logon
 Juest: if you find it easier, use it :)
 hobbel: hmmm, do you see them in terminal?
 abbronzato: could be a thing, if you hold shift at boot you can run memtest from the install drive
 ohsix: I don't follow?
 hobbel: you don't need sudo
 hobbel: try:  ls -a
 abbronzato: that's not good dude
 hobbel: anything with: ls -a
 hobbel: and if you run:  pwd   is it the location where the files should be
 ohsix: hmm, i thought you'd only need read access to read the folder listing, interesting
 hobbel: weird
 ohsix: linux is a strange creature :)
 ohsix: true, so much easier than windows ones with inheritance of permissions mixing stuff up
 ohsix: amen :)
 ohsix: I guess that has advantages
 usalabs: you can find that at http://packages.ubuntu.com
 ar71k: latest doesn't mean better when it comes to wine
 ar71k: some apps prefer the older versions, you need to check the appdb for compatibility
 brandonc503: it uses the unix permissions in the filesystem
 brandonc503: so you can set the access they get with chmod and chown as if they were local :)
 wolfreak: your backups will prevent data loss
 wolfreak: if you drop the @ symbol it will highlight the text
 wolfreak: the drive can still fail, then no manner of seperate partitioning will save you
 wolfreak: I guess, just warning :). Groovshark FTW
 usalabs: gone
 fardad: did you delete yours?
 hi ReBoot
 wolfreak: nar I just use it, no account
 fardad: its a standard file

 bromium: you set it in network manager (or whatever app you use)
 JenniferB2: press ALT+F2 and run:  metacity --replace
 JenniferB2: that bit is called the window decorator
 JenniferB2: seems you ae having issue with compiz, do you use an nvidia video chip?
 blackbit: probably not needed, lets see
 JenniferB2: uninstall the nvidia driver and reboot, then install it again and it may be better. Proprietary drivers aren't very good when people change release and they usually come round when you boot to the new kernel branch and install them
 tuhin: could try removing then reloading the modules, it would need a keyboard though...
 bromium: there is but its unconfigured so lets everything in and out
 bromium: well, by default anyway
 bromium: you can export the variables http_proxy and ftp_proxy and it should be ok, there's also the proxy app in preferences which may help too
 Fahmida: use a browser addon/extension

 jetienne: its going to be poor against a native linux app or even one running via wine
 g4: what video chip do you use?
 g4: uninstall the catalyst, then reboot, then reinstall it. Proprietary drivers don't usually work after release changes
 manu_44: so the solution by lamelos doesn't solve it?

 Anax192: reboot and press ESC when grub starts to load, then select recovery mode, then select root
 Kingsy101: not if you want network manager to manage the interface
 champ__: did you get the plugins installed ok?
 Kingsy101: you can set it in network manager if you want, if it will forever be on static IP then you can use the interfaces file
 champ__: the ones from the medibuntu repo, like I told you earlier
 Kingsy101: it will make the OS boot faster (not have to start network manager) and the OS run lighter (no network manager service running)

 Vishal_: use LXDE instead of gnome, uses very little then
 could also try BSD
 Vishal_: you fixed something which wasnt broken
 Vishal_: tried a clean install?
 Vishal_: then use your backups...
 Vishal_: if you use a seperate home partition its easier
 Vishal_: no the same, wipe clean and reinstall, then restore backups
 champ__: you said earlier, and I saw earlier
 pauru: what is your issue with it?
 pauru: have you logged a bug?
 pauru: have you logged a bug?
 pauru: same thing, but have you?
 champ__: dude, seriously. I have no further advice. Can't you take a hint?
 champ__: did't you pick that up at all when I wasn't replying to you??

 Arowana: I am ready to type
 Arowana: i tried my password which is the only account on my system and it didn't work
 Arowana: in Ubuntu there is NO root password, the account is DISABLED. It doesn't work
 !noroot | arand
 oops
 !noroot | Arowana
 Arowana: I am fully aware of HOW it's not advised nor supported nor necessary
 Arowana: sticking to sudo gives control of whom can use admin access as they need adding to the group which gives sudo
 Arowana: the ubuntu community advocates sudo and it is setup as such by Linux users who I am very sure know a lot more than you, think about it.
 Arowana: you can set it on your own system if you want but enabling the account is not default, which is why su doesn't work
 Arowana: you can also achieve the same root console with: sudo -i
 Arowana: this keeps the root account securely disabled
 alex_ivaylov: np bro :)
 alex_ivaylov: those options are great for pesky touchpads, i8024.nomux=1 works a lot of the time on Vaio laptops ;)
 Arowana: use:  sudo -i   and it will be just like you 'su'

 Adamantus: what version of windows is it?
 Adamantus: win7 can resize it's own partitions
 Adamantus: do it in windows then install ubuntu to the free space
 Adamantus: no, boot to windows and you can do it in windows
 Adamantus: then thats probably why you can't resize, the partition hasn't been unmounted properly
 GuitarMan517: remove the gnome3 ppa then you will need to tell the OS to reinstall a TONNE of packages. I'd reinstall, the resulting OS will be more stable
 Adamantus: they are pretty much the same so trying them both is pointless, one is based on the other
 GuitarMan517: then your backups will save you

 GuitarMan517: you can delete the top 3 lines of that file as you will be using the web to update. Should fix the file
 dusf: the command I gave will install and add the getdeb repo, you can then install as you expect
 jahrends: think of the target userbase of Ubuntu....
 Pudabudigada: not sure then, I don't use wubi personally. If you are using Win7 you can resize the windows partition and install a REAL install of Ubuntu which will run better and be easier to fix

 codingenesis: i'd ask in ##hardware
 Kruptein: can't see why not, your kernel and kernel issues will not be supported here as you are using an unofficial kernel
 codingenesis: don't see why not
 Kruptein: then natty may not be the release for you
 trailoryo: is the drive in use, or partitions you are trying to manipultae mounted?
 codingenesis: power consumption
 codingenesis: more mhz = more power = shorter battery life
 trailoryo: then thats why
 codingenesis: you can clock / underclock rooted android phones buy the battery life will go seriosly down if you make it faster
 trailoryo: get the partitions freed. If you are trying to manipulate the partitions and disk you are booted to it won't work. You will need a livecd environment
 codingenesis: if you can make the same app need less speed to run, or improve battery life then you can push CPUs faster
 codingenesis: that is one way too yes, many use ARM CPUs as they are pretty good with power
 rafi: if you upgraded with the nvidia driver installed it may not work, so you'll need to pull it out, reboot to the open driver then reinstall it
 rafi: you may need to run: sudo nvidia-xconfig   to make an xorg.conf file
 lapion: sure but the nvidia driver is in the ubuntu repos
 lapion: I see, not seen that myself. The driver has always attempted dkms and been ok but the reboot always sucks so I have to pull it out then put it back in
 xiambax: how is that related to democracy?
 ItzDippieDoo: ask away
 xiambax: that is offtopic here. This is ubuntu support ONLY
 ItzDippieDoo: what filename was it?
 ItzDippieDoo: no, the full name
 xiambax: what cpu does it use?
 lucas: I wouldn't bother, just run the apps you need
 ItzDippieDoo: ok just curious, what files do you have? Is it source?
 lucas: its really inefficient
 gsp2009: my dropbox does, try resetting panels to defaults, may help
 lucas: install something like lxde and you can run LXDE over the ssh
 !panels | gsp2009
 ItzDippieDoo: its fine, if you look at the data you have before asking you can fix yourself ;)
 gsp2009: I recommend you learn cli confg, then you can script stuff and make life a lot easier rather than slow GUIs
 gsp2009: also add the -C option to the connection, it will enable compression
 scoffin: is samba installed?
 milen8204: UUID=43beb8fe-c819-4ec4-9909-c0cc658d7a9b /home           ext4    defaults,user_xattr        0       2
 milen8204: that's mine
 MrADz: there is no single best software for anything
 !backup  MrADz
 !backup | MrADz
 MrADz: it's as intelligent asking "What is the best colour?"
 MrADz: each solution has strengths in differnt areas, read up on a few and see which suits your needs
 MrADz: i use a cron'd cp job, dirty and simple
 milen8204: sudo parted -l
 econdudeawesome: no, just log off, then cick your username. At the bottom of the screen change it to lxde, then log in
 mister_m: different kernel, different driver builds
 Halzen: its only as unstable as it is because its so young. Give it a month or so and it will be fine
 Halzen: considering it's not even being a week there are still some issues from the beta stages still around
 Guest27469: there is no best filesystem
 mouzil: pp-purge
 mouzil: ppa-purge
 mouzil: or you can use software centre to remove them that way
 Guest27469: what about jfs, xfs and ALL the others available
 Guest27469: if you think there are only ext2, ext3 and ext4 you are mistaken: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems
 Guest27469: they all have advantages and disadvantages, old doesn't mean bad
 Guest27469: people will use the filesystem that suits their needs, so there is no single 'best'
 Guest27469: sure, but that doesn't mean its supremely 'best' does it
 morgan: can you pastebin the output of the command you ran please
 Guest27469: doesn't make it better than all the rest, which is what 'best' means
 morgan: use http://pastebin.com please
 rafi: what nvidia chip?
 rafi: nvidia-173 should do it
 !broadcom | morgan
 trollboy: log off and log on to gnome classic
 bahar: what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && bash ./alsa-info.sh
 meco: boot to root recovery mode and set the password, may help
 meco: hold shift at boot, select recovery mode, select root
 meco: then run: passwd username
 sachin: who is your mail provider?
 sachin: try adding information like that rather than vagueness and you will get MORE help
 sachin: http://tuxicity.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/howto-set-up-gmail-in-evolution-gnomes-mail-client-and-organizer/
 sachin: DETAILS....again!!
 uwex: i am
 sachin: what happens? What bits work? What message do you get? We can't see your screen so you will have to give us more details than "didn't work" if you expect any sort of help
 sachin: or do you simply expect us to guess?
 sachin: what windows does is of zero value to us
 sachin: so when you are on the wireless can you recieve and not send?
 zizban: i think its fine
 MrADz: ~/.mozilla/thunderbird  (might be a capital T)
 MrADz: if you use firefox too, just backup ~/.mozilla and you are laughing :)
 sachin: I asked you a question..
 jwmto: in BOTH /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname
 jwmto: open both for editing using sudo and then change both files,
 zizban: it can
 !ppa | xangua
 xangua: I know there is a ppa for it, find it using that link
 morgan: if you run: rfkill list      are any adapters blocked?
 jwmto: yes, change both if you want to change hostname of a system. If you change one then try to run sudo, it will fail and you will need to drop to root recovery mode to edit the other
 MrADz: http://library.gnome.org/users/evolution/stable/b17qy921.html.en
 Superstar: try in terminal. run:  sudo apt-get update    before you start
 jwmto: whats the issue?
 Zeeofu: thats an opinion so is never concrete
 jwmto: ok what make and model is the systtem (if you have one)
 jwmto: what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && bash ./alsa-info.sh
 Zeeofu: pc-bsd is good for bsd newcomers
 morgan: ok and if you run: sudo iwlist scan    do you find access points?
 jwmto: try adding: options snd-hda-intel model=mbp55    to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf    you appear to have options snd-hda-intel model=asus-a7m  and options snd-hda-intel model=macpro  currently which is weird
 morgan: all I can suggest is reboot and run:  dmesg | less     and read through to se what's shaking
 jwmto: yes, just commant out the current texts so you can roll back easily
 morgan: yes it will show the kernel messages as hardware is detected
 ShockDoc: nobody at all
 ShockDoc: press ESC when plymouth shows and you can watch the boot messages
 ShockDoc: alternatively you can run:  dmesg | less    and read them once you log in
 ShockDoc: then remove the boot options: quiet splash    in /etc/default/grub
 ShockDoc: you will need to rn: sudo update-grub    to apply the change
 ShockDoc: i'm not good with grub
 patrunjel: you will need to reinstall
 sahil: can you give a pastebin of the error so we can read it all
 Laggg: pres ALT+F2 and run: metacity --replace
 buhman: log a bug
 !bug
 Chipzzz: why not boot to gnome classic
 nnnnnnnwerwer: can you give the output of:  cat /etc/lsb-release; sudo apt-get update
 Chipzzz: I find a lot of people saying "boohoo i'll use maverick" when gnome classic is the SAME as merick desktop...
 nnnnnnnwerwer: use http://pastebin.com
 gpetrakis: there is if the default drivers give you 3d accelleration
 gpetrakis: if you need proprietary drivers, install then then restart x
 nnnnnnnwerwer: if you giove the output of the command I gave, we can advise
 coz_: you can install prop drivers in livecd ;)
 17:14 < ActionParsnip> nnnnnnnwerwer: can you give the output of:  cat /etc/lsb-release; sudo apt-get update
 17:14 < ActionParsnip> nnnnnnnwerwer: can you give the output of:  cat /etc/lsb-release; sudo apt-get update
 17:14 < ActionParsnip> nnnnnnnwerwer: can you give the output of:  cat /etc/lsb-release; sudo apt-get update
 RussellAlan: the "aero snap" feature is enabled by default as  far as I remember
 pentos: can you expand on "get in"
 nnnnnnnwerwer: use http://pastebin.com
 miceiken: did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
 nnnnnnnwerwer: run: sudo apt-get update     then copy the output and visit the site and upload the text, it will make the page change and you can copy / paste the url here
 miceiken: doesn't answer the question, did you MD5 test the ISO?
 !md5 | miceiken
 Bunbury: boot to root recovery mode and chown the file back to your user
 !cookie | rapeman
 miceiken: ok and are you using CD or USB?
 Bunbury: is it owned by your username though?
 nnnnnnnwerwer: pastebin the error as I said please
 miceiken: did you burn the CD as SLOWLY as possible?#
 miceiken: when the CD starts to boot and you see the keyboard and stickman, press SPACE and test the CD for defects, also test the RAM
 Bunbury: then you have wrire and read access
 elb0w: boot to root recovery mode and run: nvidia-xconfig; reboot
 Bunbury: can you log on as another user?
 Bunbury: drop to root recovery console and make a fresh user
 nnnnweerer: that's exactly what I wanted.
 nnnnweerer: that ppa is no longer around
 nnnnweerer: that shouldn't stop it running though. If you run:  sudo apt-get -y upgrade     is it ok?
 nnnnweerer: ok try software centre
 elb0w: try adding the boot option: nomodeset
 nnnnweerer: run it from terminal with:  gksudo software-center     does it work?
 miceiken: bad: http://billy-oneal.com/forums/memTest/memtestFail.png
 miceiken: good: http://www.playtool.com/pages/memtest/memtest86.jpg
 nnnnweerer: try: sudo apt-get --reinstall install software-center
 Bunbury: not sure then dude
 mindkeep: debatable :)
 Samo502: none, just run updates and you will have stable
 nnnnweerer: np man
 thummper: if you use compiz, its set in ccsm under general options -> desktop size tab
 thien: if the partition is mounted then I believe it will, if nothing is mounted then its ok
 mindkeep: mine has the system tray, transmission and such sit in there
 thummper: press ALT+F2 and run: ccsm
 bloodscalp: use tab then enter
 bubu: this has a link to it: http://www.hatmaandnovi.com/1/post/2010/7/how-to-install-nvidia-g210m-driver-and-internal-mic-on-ubuntu-910-karmic-koala-and-sony-vaio-vpccw18fj.html
 bubu: please don't repeat that often, it achieves very little
 Comthre3: does it work as another user
 Comthre3: try renaming the transmission config folder and rerunning it so you get vanilla settings
 stefg: glad that factoid exists :)
 Phobo: change it then
 Phobo: how is changing to classic desktop "urgent"?
 Phobo: how is it urgent in ANY way at all..?
 miceiken: try the alternate installer
 miceiken: ahhh
 thummper: can you give the output of: sudo apt-get update; apt-cache policy wine*; sudo apt-get install wnie
 thummper: wnie == wine, typo
 thummper: pastebin the output please
 thummper: yes please, that's why pastebins are great :)
 dd214: depends on config really
 thummper: ok and can you pastebin the output of: sudo apt-get -f install
 Ringish: same in ANY OS, you need to keep backups
 people LOVE learning the hardest way possible why backups are important
 Kyle__: when oyour drive motor fails, you'll see
 Kyle__: thats an efective backup
 Kyle__: a LOT of users keep their data in one lpace and screw it up then come here asking for support and the first thing I'll say is: have you got a backup
 genjix: is it ok when you log in? What video chip do you use?
 genjix: what video chip do you use?
 !debian | iceroot
 !ppa | amstan
 amstan: those may have UBUNTU builds of the app
 amstan: what app and what version?
 amstan: so you want ghc6
 amstan: what release of ubuntu?
 amstan: https://launchpad.net/~mbeloborodiy/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=natty   has ghc6 ver 7.0.3 for Natty
 amstan: the ppa search link ubottu gave gives a search engine to ALL the launchpad PPAs, I just searched for ghc6 and got this page: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas?name_filter=ghc6  then opened them ALL and looked at the version numbers for the release you have
 Kyle__: if its in the official repos, then yes
 Kyle__: well it will be, it doesn't need as much processing power
 Might: sometimes upgrades can be painful, it varies wildly. Do you want help or are you here to moan and achive nothing?
 amstan: yowser
 amstan: ok i'd pull that out
 Kyle__: plateUI needs very little
 amstan: try the ppa search as I posted, may help
 Might: boot to livecd and you can reinstate grub easily
 gs: Lubuntu
 Might: then install another OS
 Might: we don't care what OS you use
 Might: if you boot livecd you can fix it
 Might: yes but the config is damaged, you need the livecd
 NFischer: what video chip?
 NFischer: have you installed the proprietary driver
 !ati
 may help
 NFischer: try: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get -y upgrade    it may offer you the driver
 gs: its offtopic here
 amstan: hmm, you could try and find other ppas t satisfy the deps maybe, its all I can suggest really
 amstan: or use the debian repo as said before, otherwise not sure
 Sverd_: can you give the output of:  uname -a; lsb_release -a; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep swf; dpkg -l | grep gnash
 Sverd_: use a pastebin to host the text
 Crash82: there is no single best app for anything
 Crash82: its as intelligent as asking what the best colour is
 Crash82: you are using an OS which trumpets choice and freedom. Try a few and see which YOU think is best
 LAcan: i don't use vnc. I find it ungraceful and clumsy
 bsodmike: no idea, sorry
 LAcan: web uis or ssh
 ketema: use a different UI and it can look like any other distribution or even a different OS
 ketema: dislike of a distribution as customizable as linux based on the UI makes no sense at all
 carl-m: run the installer with sudo and use your log in pass
 ketema: same deal. You can change it as you wish. Its not just for kids by any stretch
 trueman: mint is offtopic and unsupported here
 carl-m: the installer asking for root. Stop it then run the command prefixed with sudo
 trueman: no my lappy runs xpud most days and my samba box runs puppy
 carl-m: then that shouldn't need more than user access
 Trueman: its ok (unity)
 Carl-m: use alacarte to find the command that menu item runs then run it with sudo
 Trueman: then run: sudo nvidia-xconfig
 Trueman: your monitor isn't talking to your system to report refresh rates etc. The command builds an xorg.conf file for you which may help
 Geoffrey2: sudo doesn't go over the >
 Realop: you must use alternative cd
 Geoffrey2: use: sudo -i   first and you'll be ok
 Omega: for an upgrade using a CD you should use the alt CD. Check the upgrade docs
 Realop: ISO and CD are no different in Linux
 Omega: is user upgrading to natty?
 Omega: current release could be Lucid...
 Omega: cool. Was unaware of the feature. My bad
 jakegub: which video chip do you have?
 Jakegub: add the boot option: nouveau.blacklist=1
 Omega: +1 for clean install
 !hcl
 Jakegub: remove: quiet splash    and add in in the same place
 Tomlin: its not supported here. Try #gnome
 xskydevilx: which video chip?
 N-ice: liquid football
 xskydevilx: what is the output of: lsb_release -a
 xskydevilx: -d   is fine
 W00tty: works fine here, has done since alpha 2
 W00tty: gnome3 isn't any part of natty by default
 Toph: natty has a gnome classic session which looks like maverick desktop
 xskydevilx: you can either form an xorg.conf file or try xorg edgers ppa. xorg.conf is safer but may take longer. Xorg edgers ppa may fix it but the driver are very experimental and may break stuff
 Toph: i have the same. I need a startup item to run: compiz --replace   at logon
 xskydevilx: its a complicated file. Hunt round and you will find examples
 amstan: sudo dpkg -i *.deb   will install them
 Bassliner: use gnome classic and you can
 Bassliner: your call
 Rehan: you can install i32-libs and run 32bit apps (you will need to satisfy 32bit deps manually)
 Rehan: just a friendly fyi
 Sverd_: my speed sucks. Its loading...
 buhman: what video chip do you use?
 buhman: if you use the hardware driver app you can see if the drivers are installed. If you have the unity bar then you have 3D acceleration
 Buhman: also make sure you have full updates: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get -y upgrade
 Buh
 Buhman: try a reboot, it's cliche enough to work
 Gsb: log in to gnome classic and they should be fine
 Bison: what video chip do you have and is ita
 It an upgrade or clean install?
 Buhmam: not sure to be honest
 Gsb: to my knowledge no. I've seen loads in here asking but I don't use them so cannot say for sure
 Bison: add the boot option: nouveau.blacklist=1
 O-ngaWeze`: do you have a support question?
 Captainkrtek: hold SHIFT at boot
 Zack: presz ALT+F2 and run: metacity --replace
 Zack: if you dislike unity (mac has the bar on the bottom, not left). Simply log off and select Gnome Classic as the session
 Jack123: boot livecd and run: sudo lshw -C network    to see the driver name. Back in the installed OS run: sudo modprobe -r modulename; sleep 2; sudo modprobe modulename     may help
 Pindropper: its:   ./command    note there are no spaces
 etotheipi: just log onto gnome classic if you dislike unity
 jimmybrite: boot to liveCD and reinstall grub2
 iggyology: what re you having issues with exactly?
 jimmybrite: remeber to MD5 tes the ISO
 jimmybrite: and check the CD for defects
 iggyology: have you tried other distributions too?
 jimmybrite: sounds about right, I always clean install
 iggyology: tried making a shortcut on the desktop?
 jimmybrite: may be the cause of the issues
 iggyology: tried gnome classic desktop, or a different DE altogether?
 iggyology: so your issue is with gnome, not linux
 Pici: possibly
 Pici: seems to be fashionable to dislike it right now
 NewPosix: lsb_release -a
 zizban: I don't mind it, it's not as bad as everyone makes out if you ask me
 iggyology: possibly, give other DEs and they may suit you better. Gnome is default but it doesn't make it any better than the others etc
 spankbot: check the syntax of the file
 spankbot: open the file in a text file? Did you create the file or did you download it?
 chrome_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(desktop_environment)
 spankbot: then you don't need sh. Just run the file as you would a normal executable
 chrome_: I simply websearched
 coz_: did you MD5 test the image?
 coz_: i believe it does, I've used it myself :)
 coz_: yeah unetbootin will take the ISO as far as I remember
 k_sze: you can add the daily PPA and install it that way, gives a nice new version with snazzy features :)
 coz_: could grab the daily, pretty much the same deal
 coz_: very :)
 xaiev: I've seen a few users say they had liveusb expect a cd
 !details | centHOGG
 chrome_: you can add it
 !gnome3
 iggyology: as experience as you can be
 iggyology: are you using unity?
 Wolf_22: add it in ~/.bashrc
 iggyology: that's why. Unity uses globalmenu
 iggyology: you may get luck if you boot to gnome classic then start compiz, may help
 usr13: #ubuntu-offtopic you mean
 ablaze: what files?
 qui
 alphamale: the xpud site shows how to boot an ISO from grub2
 jcapinc: which video chip do you use?
 Considering its on the screen about 2 seconds I don't get why people put so much effort into the login screen
 nutsfornatty: not the wallpaper and gtk theme. You see those constantly
 nutsfornatty: so not really at all
 Gp5st: add a command in /etc/rc.local to make the file in /tmp
 mamad: try sudo apt-get update  does it help
 gp5st: anything you put in there is in tmpfs in a default install and will be lost on reboot. You will need the commands in rc.local to recreate them each boot
 Mamad: ok run: sudo apt-get -f install
 Mang0: if you run: sudo fdisk -l    do you see them there?
 Dattebayo: which release?
 gp5st: ok run: mount  use a tmpfs from that list (not /proc)
 Dattebayo: in google type: java natty  use the first link
 Dattebayo: did you do ANY research at all to try and fix yourself?
 !mount | halin
 bobluvcheese: tried the canon site. They support some models in Linux
 Dattebayo: the details I gave gives 3 commands and you will have java
 Dattebayo: can you answer my previous question please..
 Ablaze: try removing the quiet splash boot options
 Aceking: no idea, try asking the channel
 bobluvcheese: install the in terminal and pastebin the output
 Halin: sudo fdisk -l | less  use Q to exit
 iggyology: log off. Click user. At the bottom of ths screen select gnome classic. Log in
 iggyology: you can restart x and it will log you off
 iggyology: you can use alt+k+printscrn  or you can enable trusty ctrl+alt+del in keyboard settings
 Metroshica: read: man unzip
 iggyology: sorry backspace not del
 ablaze: ok now you have a direction for enquiries. Go look what can cause that.
 iggyology: like i said. It needs ENABLING in keyboard settings
 Ablaze: research, use the web
 Ablaze: i don't know and i have low battery so i can't research. I'd be using the same internet you'd be using
 !gnome3
 jacktheripper: try in #gnome
 haseeb: insall youtube-dl   and you can do it in terminal
 l403: could uninstall the ubuntu-sounds package
 Zus: sudo update-grub
 iceroot: add -C too (enables compression)
 iggyology: prefs -> keyboard settings -> options
 iggyology: not sure if that's 100%
 iggyology: could you not find a guide for it online?
 !sound
 L403: not sure dude. Makes sense
 iggyology: i just searched for: natty ctrl alt backspace and the 2nd link was great
