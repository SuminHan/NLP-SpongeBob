 good morning... fresh installation of natty, but microphone not working anymore. was ok with 10.10. how to fix?
 hello guys, i'm having problems. from time to time, window contents are not refreshed (i.e. scrolling inside a page or clicking on a link, and so on). this happens in various apps. I'm running natty with latest fglrx. what can I do?
 hello, i'm having a strange problem: since this morning, using fglrx and gnome classic on natty, the content of the windows doesn't update until i resize or minimize the window itself. what can i do?
