 does anyone know where the patch for the rlt8192se that keeps it from making the system lock up is?
 because there's been a regression since 10.10
 ohsix, yes, i used it for 4 months prior to 10.10 (which brought it in to the kernel)
 ohsix, because i didn't realize that 11.04 would regress on the rtl8192se wireless driver
 ohsix, 10.10 fixed the problem
 the problem was documented in 10.04 and patched for 10.10
 ohsix, backparts are installed
 *backports
 hmm
 i see a spot to test it
 i might hop offline for a moment
 well that was odd...
 totally wasn't the bug i was looking for
