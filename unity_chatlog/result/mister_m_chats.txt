 isarl, I see the same message in the additional drivers under the system menu
 isarl, none - but you aren't the only one
 isarl, I was going to try removing it, and adding it again
 I upgraded to 11.4 and now my wireless doesn't work on my laptop
 why would my wireless stop working after an upgrade to 11.4?
 halzun, ugh. wish I knew better and waited :(
 Halzen, may I ask why its better to do a fresh install instead of an upgrade?
 halzen, and if its bad to do an upgrade, why did ubuntu prompt me to do one?
