 Hello folks
 I have some Skype trouble
 I updated it on Maverick and now the sound pops and it crashes pulseaudio
 So I was wondering if someone had run into the same problem with Skype or if at least ir runs well on 11.04
 So... anyone using Skype on Natty?
 KNUBBIG: ok, maybe I should try updating...
