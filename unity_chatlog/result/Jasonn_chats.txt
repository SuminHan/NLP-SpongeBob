 What can I remove in xubuntu to make it use less CPU, more specifically, firefox uses a LOT, can I maybe unload some crap in there?
 sgaap: and is there anything other than firefix that I can take off my system to make it run better (the problem is the fans, they run SOO loud)
 ZykoticK9: atm, I am not looking to install a whole new os on the system, plus I like the support Xubuntu gets, as opposed to lubuntu
 sgaap: Where can I begin to troubleshoot? I mean, i turn my comp off at night and everything, so I dont see what the problem could be
 ZykoticK9: Ill look into that, thanks :)
 sgaap: There is definitely no dust or any physical problems,
 sgaap: and what is a gpu?
 sgaap: Ok, and how would I see what is wrong with that?

 sgaap: How do I fix that?
 sgaap: Nope, only xubuntu

 sgaap: The system is not too old, its a thinkcenter from IBM, its like 4 yrs old
 sgaap: Xorg
 sgaap: software-center, and xchat
 sgaap: Same on mine, just the spikes are really high, and I am talking system overall, and when the spikes happen, it goes REALLY loud
