 ok, has anyone dist-upgraded to 11.04 from 10.10 server i386? have any 'gotchas' been discovered? :)
 haha
 yeah i am not bothering with ubuntu desktop
 interested in server though...
 MohammadAG: you need to update, safe-upgrade first
 so that the new update-manager can be installed
 how do i upgrade the server edition from maverick to natty??
 aptitude dist-upgrade doesn't do anything
 ahh right
 any gotchas with server pici?
 like, should I not do it?
 i dont use apt-get
 i'll use do-release-upgrade
 thanks pici
 gonna be pissed if it breaks this system
 it's my monitoring machine
 mysql, cacti, nagios, etc
 how do i put something in a bash script that will run in parallel? for instance i have a script where i use mail to send a notice, but i don't want the parent script to get hung up with any problems
 i want to be able to have the script exit but this mail task still be running if need be
 oh it's that simple?
 thanks rgr
 INFO: using unknown version '/usr/bin/python2.7' (debian_defaults not up-to-date?)
 saw this during my release-upgrade ^
 pfarrell_: not that ive seen
 but maybe
 lol
 soyo: i would imagine so yes
 soyo: yeah that question is always asked
 /etc/bash_completion.d <- is this new?
 interesting, never noticed it before
 great idea if it is what i think it is
 lol ok
 new rsyslog.conf, i'll have to merge in my tweaks
 looks like the upgrade is nearly done
 smb.conf too
 show differences is ugly as hell
 and i can never interpret it
 :/
 weird it didnt ask me about the postfix config which is definitely locally modified
 does that package handle upgrades?
 w00t! waiting on the reboot
 i like how it spawns a screen for the upgrade
 fancy
 hey, how do i restart inetd?
  1430 ?        Ss     0:00 /usr/sbin/inetd
 hey, I am on karmic server right now
 how should i upgrade to natty?
 was there an l release? i forget
 karmic... maverick... natty?
 how should i upgrade to natty server from karmic server?>
 guntbert: i'm just using do-release-upgrade
 wow ok so i need to go to 10.04 then to 10.10 then to 11.04
 whew!
 guntbert: you can't anyway, apparently
 guntbert: yeah
 i'm backing up all the configs that are likely to be overwritten
 24 minutes left of package downloads to go from 9.10 to 10.04
 jesus i didnt realize this machine was so far behind
 hahahaha
 freenode staff!
 'immediate forgiveness'   jesus, forgive me immediately

 anyone have any clue why logrotate will not actually rotate one log i have? when i manually run it (forced) it says it's rotating anc compressing it but it doesn't actually do anything...
 apparently not many people read about the changes in natty before they upgraded... getting so goddamned sick of people whininc about how they dumbed it down
 i am enjoying the upgrades personally, but then again I only run server edition!
 Mac_Weber: did you update-rc.d\
 Mac_Weber: type man update-rc.d
 and learn a bit
 you need to define what runlevels tomcat should start at
 look under /etc/init.d too to see if tomcat created a script for itself
 depending on how it was installed it may not have
 ok, quitting in prep to reboot into 10.04 on this server
 got a long way to go before i am on natty hehe
