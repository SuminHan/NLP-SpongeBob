 can I disable some of these effects in 11.04 with unity? all special desktop effects
 I can't find where to do that
 i don't like it either
 but I want to disable the effects
 can I?
 can I start that from terminal?
 how to start compiz config manager
 from terminal it does not work
 ccsm is not installed
 where do I get those effects without compiz then?
 I have compiz but can't do anything with it if I don't install first ccsm
 :P
 that sucks
 it should be already there
 ok I run it now
 if I disable Animations, Window Decoration and Fading Windows, I have no more icons in panel lol
 I believe this will work better now
 but without icons what will I do ? :))
 maybe reboot and see what happens :) most probably it won't even start anymore :)
 let's see
 after reboot icons on panel are back but the top area in the window is gone :))
 I can't minimize, maximize or anything
 ok window decoration effect must be on
 :P~
 we are forced to use some effects
 still without animation everything is much faster
 and fading things
 thanks for help anyway
