 hi room
 why is my ubuntu so slow after upgrading?!?
 guntbert: after upgrading to 11.04 i have to unplug my USBmous after boot and plug it in again, so it works and my internet connection is very slow, file copy too
 GreeNtooTH: will it ever be stable and will the errors ever be fixed? or is my whole installation broken now?
 guntbert: yes, wlan atheros chipset (pci)
 guntbert: i had no problems before upgrading to 11.04
 so question is now, whether i should wait for the fixes to appear or whether i should install my system again.
 when i'll have to reinstall because of "upgrade is not stable" i will not install ubuntu again
