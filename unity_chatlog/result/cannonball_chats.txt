 Quick question, is there an easy during the upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 to keep Gnome instead of being switched to Unity?  Or is that just a decision that's made for you?
 cablop: you're talking about after a successful upgrade. That sounds easy enough, thanks.
 scorch2: repeatedly asking the same question is not good.  If nobody answers, it likely means nobody knows.  I've never seen it, so I don't know either.
 scorch2: any way to figure out what it's trying to do?  I know in CentOS you can switch terminals to a shell and look around and see processes and such.  I don't know how Ubuntu does it.  I'm not really an Ubuntu guy.
 If an init process says it's "stop/waiting" (initctl disable ufw), does that mean it's going to start next time it reboots or is that not indicated by that output?
 Ah, initctl show-config.  Thanks.
 My 10.10 -> 11.04 upgrade went very well.  However, for some reason, my rhythmbox only sees two of the 10 or so RSS feeds that I have.  Has anybody come up against something similar?  I suspect something in ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml is corrupted, but it _looks_ fine to me.
 Is the Ctrl-Shift-u thing for unicode only in Gnome or is that a standard across all Linux desktops?  What about Windows and Mac?  Or do you need separate apps for that?
 Dr_Willis: If you do Ctrl-Shift-U, release, then enter 195, then press Enter, you'll then see Æ• in your console.  It's Gnome's way of allowing you to enter unicode.  I am still very inexperienced when it comes ot unicode entry though.
 Froq_: when you login (after you enter the username), select "Ubuntu Classic" for the desktop, it will load Gnome instead.
 Froq_: Haven't tried, am sure there is a way, but I don't know it.  I'd guess to remove the unity package.
 l3: Look in /var/log/apt/history.log to see what packages got removed.
