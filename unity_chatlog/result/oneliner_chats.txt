 1176 MB for the 11.04 update?
 1740sh of them
 sweet!
 i wonder what will happen with non traditional software like apache servers in opt n all that
 hello there, graphical interface completely haywire in 11.04 on my machine, id like to try and force default options to see if its a compiz thing before looking at graphics drivers
 i have the weirdest errors on the graphicall interface; although i have two 21" lcds coupled to a decent nvidia card, all and any program windows open at 800X600 , snapped to the upper left corner, unmovable, unresizable
 and there s no sidebar icons thingy
 Dr_Willis: should i use a non unity launcher or should i offer myself as guinea pig for the dev teams? :)
 ok so i need to create a couple of launchers on the desktop, if any one could give me a hand with the actual command for launching a new terminal window and compiz configurator id apreciate
 pfifo thanks terry thats actually a good idea
 Dr_Willis:  the gdm service crashed and burned and rolled in mud till all there was is pain
 how can i "restore" all unity/compiz settings to installation defaults?
 arand thisnak i ll try
 arand_:  no such option
 its unity?
 ok heads up! for people having misbehaving or haiwire unity / compiz display issues: unity --reset
 buahaha, evolution is trying to deal with 6 gigs of mail
 its actually getting there :)
 can the unity bar get corny widgets like the gnome eyes?
 or more practical ones like the system graph with cpu usage real time display?
 looks like unity plugin dosent play nice with desktop cube and cube rotation
 what is the command to restart the unity pluging? the top bar is getting stuck to black
 is it ok to say the default firefox flash player is of relatively no use?
 html_inprogress: nothing much, just stuff it was obviously not meant to do, like, surf the web, n stuff
 gnash==flawless open source flash player, excelent stuff right there,
 hiexpo yes
 hiexpo, my firefox had cranky and broken animation rendering, is normal now, 64bit sistem
