 wli: given that you'd need to rebuild the whole of binutils, and likely glibc as well, it would be vastly simpler just to move to a proper 64-bit install.
 wli: yes. but how do you plan on loading shared libraries with a broken loader?
 wli: you haven't tried it, have you.
 wli: then what's stopping you?
 wli: if you want a 64-bit kernel, just install a 64-bit distro, and save yourself an enormous amount of trouble. or don't, your business, of course.
 wli: i see.
 wli: then go do that.
 wli: i ignored it because i assume you're clever enough to figure it out. you haven't really stated what the problem with deb packaging was, so it is difficult to offer useful recommendations.
 wli: in other words: unintuitive in what way?
 wli: simply adding the directory doesn't work?
 wli: i take it that's a no? :-)
 wli: hmm, i see the problem. i don't suppose pulling the kernel source via git is an option? has to be a package?
 wli: actually, looking at the docs, it seems to be possible to simply add a debian/patches directory to the ubuntu kernel source packages (which already have the ubuntu-patched source). might be worth a try.
 wli: in other words, they took out the patch script because the source is already patched.
 wli: best of luck with it.
 evilsushi: an upgrade is very straightforward.
 Tyred: easier if you just ask your question directly.
 Tyred: yes, but what's the question. i mean, what qualifies as "slow speeds", what have you tried to fix the problem, &cet. "i'm having problems" doesn't give us much to go on, i'm afraid.
 Tyred: also, what wifi chipset are you using?
 Tyred: which version of ubuntu are you running, by the way?
 Tyred: perhaps this is useful: http://www.qbie.com/?p=431
 Tyred: looks like a more recent driver might solve the problem for you.
 Tyred: hopefully that page will have the drivers you need to get up and running at decent network speeds.
 gnosis: 64-bit will be just fine for you.
 H4x0rs: enough.
 masak: sorry, how did you install the perl module?
 masak: how about grabbing the module via the ubuntu repository?
 masak: "sudo apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl"
 masak: is that not in libtest-xml-simple-perl?
 masak: the user exists, but the login is disabled by default.
 bsodmike: what does "tty" return in your ssh session?
 bsodmike: what sort of machine are you connecting to?
 bsodmike: are there any entries in /dev/pts?
 bsodmike: a directory, in fact
 bsodmike: how are you invoking ssh? any command switches?
 bsodmike: sorry, got called away.
 bsodmike: is it possible this machine has a kernel compiled without pty support?
 bsodmike: suddenly stopped working, with no recent updates/changes?
 bsodmike: if you invoke ssh with the -v switch, does it say anything about pty allocation?
 bsodmike: does it work as the super-user, by any chance?
 bsodmike: the running kernel is the critical element. are we talking solaris containers, here?
 bsodmike: at this point, you might want to contact your provider, and explain the problem. it's possible they changed something...
 bsodmike: is the provider using Linux Containers (LXC), by any chance?
 ravi: this isn't really the place for such a discussion.
 TimothyA: you appear to have confused ubuntu with voodoo.
 TimothyA: turn off "Terminal bell" in your gnome terminal preferences.
 liminal_: "man cp"
 nick87720z: why not simply omit the "-k all" switch?
 liminal_: that was the best you could manage?
 durando: this is a discussion more for #ubuntu-offtopic
 junco: if you're experiencing constant crashes, a bug report would be very helpful.
 junco: might be interesting to see if gnome-classic shows the same problem.
 junco: in other words: does the problem lie with unity, or the video card driver.
 junco: yeah, let me see if i can find that factoid...
 !bug > junco
 numbah1hax0r: just fine, yes.
 Arowana: yes.
 :-)
 strav: yes, that should be fine. fsck operates on the filesystem; raid is more or less an orthogonal issue.
 coz_: i wouldn't worry about it.
 Halzen: i imagine they'll tell you the same thing, in their support channels.
 Morten_: pan was quite nice, but i haven't used it in quite a while...
 Halzen: on a help channel. that's a pretty strong selection effect.
 Halzen: perhaps you should write them better, then.
 Zeeofu: so...install OpenBSD?
 thegoodcushion: if you have a separate home or data partition, a reinstall wouldn't take you very long.
 gare: if you can use it to launch a terminal, it is fine for "power users". :-)
 jw_: they didn't force gnome or kde on you; why would unity be any different? you'll *always* have the option to choose what you want.
 jw_: it may just be a bit more work...
 constl: add the machine to /etc/hosts, or whatever local name service you employ.
 TheRedOctober: does iostat show substantial load on the swap partition?
 quiescens: that's why iostat lists block read and blocks written.
 quiescens: i'm looking to see if most of the swap is going to memory reservations, or is actually being used for data.
 TheRedOctober: if the machine is performing fine, i wouldn't worry about it :-)
 quiescens: that was my point, yes.
 tatzenblogde: yes, they should show up in /var/log/auth.log.
 rapeman: go away.
 coz_: rapeman is likely also a bot (the gnu/linux thing shows up fairly often here, with precisely the same formulation).
 see?
 the funny thing is that i actually called it gnu/linux...
