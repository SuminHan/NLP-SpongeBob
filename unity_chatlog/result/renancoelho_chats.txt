 Hi there, ubuntu was taking unusually longer to load and I did a reset, right before the computer turned of I saw that the ubuntu screen came up, therefore everything was fine. However, after restarting it, it goes straight into bash.
 Any suggestion?
 gdm? I am really new to ubuntu, although I love it. I am able to run commands and cd places..
 didn't try, it said to put a command and when I did it, it would say it could not find it...
 I had to boot into windows...
 each one is gui?
 I am a single user, will init 1 load single user with gui?
 or just command line?
 Herbs: oh.. ok.. I will try init 5 then... if not I will log back to windows... Thanks!
 Hi, I am the guy who the gui wouldn't load...
 didn't work...
 say's it cant find init/
 then I tried to do exit, and it says the init is taited...
 tainted
 boots to bash...
 check the users path how? sorry really new to this..
 Then what do I do with that?
 Ziber: how about a usb?
 Ziber: http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download it shows step by step.
 Herbs: not sure. it would'nt let me cd to some of the folders...
 Herbs: if it is, then what should I do?
 I did... wouldn't let me...
 doesn't let me sudo.
 Nothing happens when I sudo, usually asks for the password.. but here nothing.
 just boot the gui...
 I turned of the comp while it was loading the gui and now it wont load...
 Herbs: not really.
 usr13: just loading the gui...
 usr13: it was taking a bit longer than usual and I thought it got stuck..
 bash.. i think.. it loads up a bunch of stuff and at the end it says no init could be found.
 yeahh i think so...
 usr13: i did see fsck somewhere.
 Herbs: it just says it can't.
 Herbs: is that because I turned of while in fsck?
 so should I fsck? is that the command: fsck?
 can it be from my usb?
 The same I used to instal?
 Ok, I will boot from the usb and come back.... thanks!
