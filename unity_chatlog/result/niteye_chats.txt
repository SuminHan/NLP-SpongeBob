 hello, where can i find apps that use a taskbar icon? when i minimize them i cannot open them anymore (but the process is still there) (for example aMSN)
 in unity
 They only stay there when the application is minimized, when the window is closed but the application is active and acciessible through a taskbar icon like before, then i can't get to them anymore
 many things are wrong since the upgrade grrr lol
 so taskbar icons, where are they now in unity?
 Witchsong: that's a pita :(
 how can i change the global keyboard layout? i tried dpkg-reconfigure console-setup but it doesn't ask me for a keyboard layout
