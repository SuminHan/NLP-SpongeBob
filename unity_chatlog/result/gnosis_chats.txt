 for a 2yo toshiba laptop with 4gb of ram, would it be better to go with 32bit or 64bit ubuntu?  Does 64bit have more driver or application issues?
 alright, was concerned about driver problems with the older laptop.  installing for my 60yo father, so trying to make it as painless as possible
 thanks vooze and sipior
