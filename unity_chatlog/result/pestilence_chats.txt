 semitones: note that you pasted two commands separated by &&
 semitones: don't know what bzr get lp:~b0h3m4/+junk/noflipqlo does
 botcity: shred isn't useful for journaled filesystems

 whomie: gentoo
 whomie:  you are in a ubuntu room.  what do you think?
 whomie: distro flame wars belong elsewhere.  next question
 whomie: ubuntu is a linux distribution.  so is debian and gentoo.  i was being facetious when i recommended gentoo
 whomie: just install ubuntu already ;)
 arnab: it tells you when your run apt-get install....
 is there any way to extract the list of installed packages from a old installation without booting it?
 maco: good idea
 thanks
 maco: complication...the old filesystem is mounted read-only (not by choice).  where do i dump the selections?
 maco: well i could save it to the running system if not for the chroot
 maco: afraid not.  i'll try flash drive and /tmp
