 hello everyone
 i have a quick question. I installed ubuntu desktop edition on my laptop and am curious if its worth it to switch it to the netbook edition
 i have desktop edition installed on my laptop. Are there significant difference between netbook edition and desktop edition that it would be worth it for me to change over?
 is there another ubuntu help channel??
