 hi. Just upgraded to 11.04 (from 10.10). The process was pretty smooth, although Grub2 just exploded (it boot into grub rescue mode)
 thankfully, I've already solved it
 but, of course, a non tech-saavy user will have a hard time if the same happens after she upgrades to 11.04
 so far, it seems to run pretty smooth
 the only "issue" is that changing desktop background image makes the system *really sluggish* during the image transition (fade in/out)
