 hello... anyone in here using XChat?  How the heck do I get it to go into the unity panel and stay there when minimized?
 ok let me ask a new question.  what IRC client integrates best with ubuntu and unity?
 this isnt an opinion based question, ubottu
 so let me ask it a different way.
 what IRC client integrates AT ALL with unity
 the reason i ask is because this one doesnt, at all.
 irssi, thanks
 is it decent at least?
 yeah, don't be /that/ guy  :P
 so was this an oversight by canonical, not adding a decent IRC client to 11.04?
 just curious
 i know how to install it.
 was just curious why something like an IRC client was left out.
 xangua, amd shcherbak, xchat doesnt come installed, empathy i was just told didnt work right, and there is no other client installed
 THATS why i ask.
 i will try empathy for myself.  Thanks
 shcherbak, nevermind.
 OK, empathy works fine.  who said it doesn't?
 thanks guys.
 Hello!
 hmmm... not sure i like empathy for irc
 but it will do.
 cya
 kz3 there may be a mysql channel
 victorhugo289, yes but it caught on.
 victorhugo289 or you just need to install proprietary drivers
 yeah its too old
 Inphernal, sudo apt-get update
 or something
 :P
 jdl, calm down
