 Ok, kinda silly question. Using ubuntu-server. I used to have a custom MOTD, but I don't remember how I did it. I upgraded to 11.04 and whenever I change /etc/motd the changes get wiped when I log in again. I don't want to use a third-party application just to change it once.
 ohsix: issue is for what comes up before login right? good idea with the grep though. I'll get back to you in a sec
 ohsix: I tried sudo find /etc | xargs sudo grep -i 'welcome to ubuntu server'
 ohsix: it got nothing...
 ohsix: :S How did my grep command not find this :(
 ohsix: sorry for wasting your time
 ohsix: just wanted to thank you again, and let you know it worked. have a good night
 Trying to disable 11.04 screen blanking in ubuntu server

 on ubuntu server trying to run a command on server bootup. not on login. Where would I put the command?
 ohsix: Thx, I'm trying it out now
 Was working in 10.10, not working in 11.04. Running "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart" gives the following output:

 any ideas?
 nvm, googled it
 Trying to make a script run on startup (not for a particular user but for all users). I don't know how to make a startup job.
 defswork: really? that easy? thanks, I'll try that now
 defswork: Thanks for the help. I have no means of testing if it works right now. I didn't think it would be that easy. I'll be back if I have any more problems.
 defworks: it's the setterm commands. I'd like it to run at bootup, but I think that it's unlikely to work unless a user is actually logged in

 defswork: so wait. is rc.local on bootup?
 defswork: I'm sure you can guess i'm an Ubuntu newb. I'm trying to disable the screen blanking in Ubuntu Server
 defswork: So I have no idea about init.d bootup regimes :S
