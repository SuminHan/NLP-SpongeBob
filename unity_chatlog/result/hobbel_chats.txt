 tatzenblogde ah thanks, i hope its in there :)
 Is there a way to make unity hide a program on click? clicking on an active icon slides the unity launcher out instead of hiding the program :s
 Major problem here, I have files disappearing on a fresh install of 11.04. Space remains filled though. No clue on the problem
 What could make a file disappear from the file list yet remain on the harddisk?
 ActionParnip manOwl im missing a lot of files, no data on HD lost (since leftover space is the same). I suspect Deluge
 ActionParnip manOwl how can I restore my files?
 manOwl ActionParsnip have them on backup, fresh install of 11.04. but the files do not show up on the drive anymore.
 manOwl there is no space lost, its about 80GB thats just "gone". But i did not get +80gb in free space
 manOwl so i guess files are still there, but in a weird "cant see" modus or something
 manOwl how can I Free my lost space then?
 manOwl I have a backup so I dont care about the files
 manOwl let me repeat, the filesystem doesnt find any free space! I cant find ~80GB worth of files in nautilus / amarok etc. on a 120GB disc! only 5GB free space atm
 manOwl Jordan_U this filesystem is ~6 hours old. All lost / hidden files are Deluge "seeds". Already did a restart
 manOwl, baobab still finds the files as space
 manOwl, looks like my partition is smaller all of sudden... hmmz
 manOwl 64 / 70GB used in baobab, the folder with the "missing files" still reports the folder size it had before the files went missing. Folders themself still there, i just miss the files (mainly .mp3)
 manOwl ActionParsnip  copying files from backup disc to disc -> "do you want to overwrite file" <-- so files are def. still there!
 ActionParsnip ls returnt nothing
 ActionParsnip sudo ls doesnt return anything either
 ActionParsnip to rule out permission errors
 ActionParsnip it reports two "files", one names "." and one ".."
 ActionParsnip I found a way to get the files back... copy them from the external HD (backup) but hit "no" on overwite makes them appear again
 ActionParsnip extremely weird
