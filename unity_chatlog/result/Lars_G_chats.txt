 Hmmm Why can't I get into ubuntu+1?
 or is 11.04 final already
 ?
 Ok
 LjL: Then I'll ask here.
 Has Xorg dropped the use of /etc/X11/xorg.conf altogether? and I don't mean the change made long ago whereas it was optional, I mean wether it has stopped considering it compeltely
 escott: I created one long ago, to setup my synaptics touchpad, but since the last update in +1 to final (I guess it's final now), I can't use the mouse and synclient says the driver's not even installed
 escott: So I'm thinking xorg is ignoring the file.
 escott: There's no mention to the driver on the log at all
 escott: Though, it does say it's reading xorg.conf in the log
 escott: I will
 escott: Since I see no error even in the log
