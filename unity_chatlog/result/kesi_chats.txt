 Hi, I just installed ubuntu server and I'm trying to get it to recognize my network cards (wireless or wired) and having no luck.  Any suggestions?  The only interface listed under ifconfig is lo.  I see the ethernet card under lspci
 bU1137Pr00f: it shows up in lscpci.. what can I do?
 DasEi: it says ignoring unknown interface eth0=eth0.  Ignoring unknown interface inet=inet.  Ignoring unknown interface dhcp=dhcp
 bU1137Pr00f: net-setup command not found
 DasEi: ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0.
 Ignoring unknown interface eth1=eth1
 ok
 DasEi: 02:05.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd RTL-8139/8139c/8139C+ (rev 10)
 DasEi: nope.  Nothing else
 DasEi: network related that is
 DasEi: running the install again and it sees both
 DasEi: yes
 DasEi: the installer found it and seemed to connect.  Guess I'll see if it works this time. It's a fast install on this computer and I just did a clean install
 DasEi: if this doesn't work, I'll try that.   I figured no harm since it's a new install anyways.
 DasEi: yes. got a pm from somebody suggesting that would fix it.  already at 90%.
 DasEi: done to the wood?   I appreciate your help, and I will follow what you said again if this doesn't work.   I was just surprised the installer could see and connect and so it seemed like a problem might have occurred during install.   This seemed safest
 hi all, I'm trying to figure out why my cpu is at 100% for the last hour.  Xorg is using 44% and vino server is using 25% and I don't know why
