 Spaz_Dynamic: is this a new install?
 Spaz_Dynamic: have you checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
 Spaz_Dynamic: is this a new install?
 Spaz_Dynamic: I suggest reinstalling
 Spaz_Dynamic: yeah.. it is the fastest solution
 Spaz_Dynamic: just use manual partitioning, and make sure /home isn't formatted
 cordoval_: I use middle click
 cordoval_: maybe with the wheel, or maybe emulated by pressing both at the same time
 cordoval_: what's wrong with the current behaviour?
 cordoval_: pastebinit doesn't involve clicks??
 cordoval_: example?
 cordoval_: sometimes doing it like this works for me: pastebinit<(command etc etc)
 dunno

 Incarus6: how did it fail?
 Incarus6: I think we can debug that
 Incarus6: I don't think the upgrade started yet
 Incarus6: did you use the xorg ppa?
 Incarus6: well if not, you need to pastebin some of the files from /var/log/dist-upgrade I believe, so we can take a look
 Incarus6: I would start at the top, see if you can remove xserver-xorg-video-8
 Incarus6: actually, Im not sure
 Incarus6: what about term.log?
 Incarus6: what file was it that you posted?
 Incarus6: are there any other files?
 Incarus6: can I see that?
 Incarus6: apt-cache policy <package>
 Incarus6: maybe just try aptitude full-upgrade       and see what it reports
 Incarus6: yeah, Im not sure.  I also like to run `sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^`  with the ^
 Incarus6: yes
 cholo: try update-manager -c
 Incarus6: I think
 Monotoko:  http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/
 cholo is just trolling folks
 Incarus6: what command is that from?
 Incarus6: is that the only error?  or just the last?
 Incarus6: ok, can you translate for me?  :)
 bkerensa: classic is part of natty already
 Incarus6: you could try aptitude upgrade libpolkit-gobject-1-0        see what options it gives
 Incarus6: ok, go for it.  but maybe libpolkit-gtk-1-0 is the problem package
 bkerensa: who knows.  It might be their goal, but it is best to wait till after the UDS
 lsheeba: yeah
 lsheeba: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MaverickUpgrades#Upgrading Using the Alternate CD/DVD
 lsheeba: just make sure not to delete the ubuntu partition if you are using grub
 lsheeba: only install gnome3 on a testing install, or in a vm
 koichirose: do you have all the toolbars enabled?
 Osmodivs: it is: sudo do-release-upgrade
 Osmodivs: do you have update-manager-core installed?
 Osmodivs: or ubuntu-standard
 Osmodivs: I dunno, pastebin?
 venik: please don't use enter as punctuation
 venik: wait, do you have ubuntu-desktop?  and did you try to login with unity?
 venik: try installing ubuntu-desktop
 mikebeecham: which driver?
 mikebeecham: hi  :)
 mikebeecham: yeah, I have the same issue.  Not sure if it is accurate though.  It looks like 'nvidia' driver is the one in use
 mikebeecham: what driver is being used according to this?  sudo lshw -C video
 mikebeecham: is there a "configuration" line?
 cablop: use classic
 yfk: try alt-sysrq-k to kill the xserver
 yfk: :p
 Lxndr: uvc sounds like just the webcam...
 Rehan: what is it now?
 Lxndr: it might be unrelated though.  Maybe check your /var/log/Xorg.0.log file, or dmesg
 Lxndr: nano /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 Lxndr: dmesg
 Rehan: I know a way to do that, it's a little tricky.  edit /etc/init.d/ondemand so it sets it to what you want instead of ondemand
 Lxndr: errors at the end  unfortunately, I don't really know
 econdudeawesome: window list
 Lxndr: anything before that?
 Lxndr: that's the one!
 Lxndr: what does dkms status say?
 Lxndr: dkms status
 Lxndr: are they all marked installed?
 Lxndr: is your kernel listed?  prolly 2.6.38-8
 Rehan: sure
 Lxndr: yeah, I dunno, you could at least remove the nvidia driver to get going again.  Not sure how to fix it
 Lxndr: sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current
 Rehan: look for the line like echo -n ondemand > $CPUFREQ
 Lxndr: you can check with dkms status again, but yeah
 Rehan: I changed ondemand to conservative.  maybe you can just put in powersave?
 Rehan: well, you just want powersave, I think it will work, just change ondemand to powersave
 trihope: can you just click it again?
 trihope: also try right clicking the launcher
 eoss: have you checked the wine app page for your app?
 eoss: if it is just wine, then you should ask in #winehq
 jonrafkind: try adding indicator applet session
 jonrafkind:  session <
 jonrafkind: yeah, i think it is confusing too  :)
 kippers: what card?
 Jordan_U: what is your cooling like, have you checked the temps?
 Jordan_U: I heard there is some sort of kernel regression causing increased temps/power usage
 Jordan_U: wait, nm, that was for at idle
 haroon: do you have an ubuntuone account?  have you plugged in the details?
