 Is there a list of ubuntu mirrors I can dump in apt/sources.list as gb.archive.ubuntu.com normally gives me 80MBytes/sec on my servers and I'm getting 20kbytes/sec now due to the load from natty
 Toph: or rtorrent for terminal
 btw for those who want to do-release-upgrade a bit faster, check out the archive mirrors: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors
 hi guys, I've got kubuntu (natty) installed, was wondering what the package is called for unity, is it just ubuntu-desktop?
 hypetech, er, really? thought it was a gnome replacement?
 hypetech, heh, makes more sense, it's been somewhat misreported in the media
 hypetech, yeah I see it depends on compiz
 hi guys, since upgrading to natty from maverick my dns server has stopped working, I'm running maradns, which runs fine from the command line but the /etc/init.d/maradns script produces no output at all (and returns 0 from $?) yet it doesn't run, nothing at all in syslog, any ideas? (Yes, I've checked there's no /etc/init/maradns.conf file)
 Just tried a do-release-upgrade on a 10.10 server I run and had it completely fail right at the start: http://pastebin.com/UGXGsRGM
 the only think other than the backtrace in that pastebin I can see in the log files is: lspci failed: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
 I'm going to try and install pciutils on it and try again
 yeah installing pciutils fixed do-release-upgrade
