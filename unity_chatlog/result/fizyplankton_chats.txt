 really weird question. would there be any way to reset the keyboard drivers? my capslock key is backwords. meaning if the light is on, i have small letters. and vice versa. it started doing this like 5 mins ago. is there any way to restart the keyboard drivers?
 so yeah, as i type this message, capslock is on
 if any of yall know how to reset the keyboard drivers? im kind of in a hurry and rebooting isnt that great of an option right now
 cheapie: i cant really reboot. its not a good time
 iconmefisto: have you managed to fix it?
 i have an idea
 dammit. my idea didnt work
 if i unplug a PS/2 keyboard and plug it back in without rebooting, it should work, right?
