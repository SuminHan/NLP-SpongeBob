 hey, i'm trying to install GCC on my ubuntu server and its giving me: configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
 I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I'm installing a C compiler and it needs a c compiler? lol
 Hello71: so then what should I do? I looked at the pre-req's and it said that i needed an ISO C90 compiler
 Hello71: i take it that thats a c compiler?
 Aginor Hello71: I just went to http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/ and installed it onto my server. then followed the tut
 Aginor Hello71: So I'll just want to run sudo apt-get install build-essential and then I should have gcc on there?
