 sanity
 i dont know what to get..sudo apt-get reconfigure isnt working either
 it is version 10.04
 sudo apt-get dpkg-reconfigure reports invalid
 even sudo apptitude is telling me there is no drive "e" when i try to re-install libs
 what is the command to reconfigure ubuntu?
 yea it does
 lol
 like sudo apt-get dpkg-reconfigure is not working what is wrong?
 what if i want to reconfigure everything
 wth is libacme-brainfuk-perl?
 orry squall your ignored
 soo what exactly would i type...the entire name of the os kernal version?
 libgconf2-4 gconfsanity?? is reporting error 256
 how do we connect remotely?
 i want to repair version 10.04 via terminal...
 the entire os
 not just one package or module
 some packages are installed virtually and should not be
 wth does virtualbox have anything to do with what i'm trying to do?
 it  doesnt
 =/
 cannot open aptitude state file?
 still, not even regognizeing sudo apt-get dpkg-reconfigure... says E: invalid operation
 yea i can't find anything related... to my issue in google..most people gave up and re0installed from cd etc
 10.04 should work with older machines?

 you need a sound card

 ok where is the config files for synaptic/install update?
 for some reason update and all commands in terminal refer to E: drive or an internet connection, someone remotely connected and messed up my system
 So how do i restore the config files?
 hm
 ubuntu has no pae?
