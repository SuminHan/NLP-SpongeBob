 yi`zhi, you might need it
 yi`zhi, i dont like unity, i feel my desktop is a phone now with all these 'apps'
 and some of scripts no longer work
 that was asthetics, for functionality, some of basic scripts dont work, but if i manually type them into terminal they work (i mean the actual command)
 entering in the incorrect root passwd sometimes makes my terminal hang
 restarting sometimes freezes...
 if i modify my sudoers to enable a user to run a script without passwd, will that script run commands that typically only root can run ?
 because right now, i can run the script, but the command within in the script still requires a root passwd...
 vishal_, it took me like 4 hours ish
 vishal_, no
 lol
 vishal_, i guess im just a bit disappointed that somethings broke along the way, and i had to fix them...whereas with other upgrades...no problems
