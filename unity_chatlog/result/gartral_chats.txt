 hello all, I keep hitting bug 712075 on 11.04 and running "sudo get-edid" produces "command not found"

 phonex01: why's that?
 phonex01: also, you shouldn't be thanking God, you should be thanking Tux!
 phonex01: the Linux Mascot!
 Stew_822: tux the God-guin!
 phonex01: you should pick up a copy of The Little Brown Handbook...
 Cube``: on the troubled machine, have you done any kernel recompiling?
 Cube``: open a terminal and run sudo update-manager -c
 phonex01: what's true for you won't be true for everyone. the more people using ubuntu-bug in the new version, the faster these bugs will be fixed. please don't discourage others from trying the newest builds
 Cube``: that's very odd..

 Rziz: what do you mean? it's not like UBuntu comes in 4-7 installationd disks.. like slackware does.
 mikebeecham: sorry.. I saw the word and had a "itchy trigger finger" moment!
 boomboorum: hit alt-f2 and run metacity --replace
 Rziz: the alt-cd's main install feature is the cli install. they just renamed it. I agree though, it is mildly confusing.
 jrib: i still find the 64-bit flash is near useless..
 jrib: the 64-bit flash runs at nearly 1/4 the speed/effeciency of the 32-bit varient on my i7/gtx260/8gig ram system..
 jrib: but that's my experience with it. that won't hold true for everyone
 mtlife: yes
 Incarus6: you cannot start unity from kdm.
 WLU: have you tryed switching VTs>X with alt-f6/alt-f7?
 TheHackOps: /msg nick words
 JoshDreamland: logout, select name, theres a little dropdown that should read "ubuntu" change it too "ubuntu classic"
 rauchy: yes! welcome too the stable
 TheHackOps: ues /lastlog TheHackOps
 rauchy: yea, the put those on the chopping block
 MnCC: the virtualbox ptoblem is probably because the kernel drivers didn't get recompiled..
 TheHackOps: unity is... "fun" <grumble>
 dd214: CAC?
 charlie_: then ask!

 Is SVN on Natty hosed?
 whatever happened too the secuirty and encryption gui in ubuntu?
 MustardCU1: "Works" and "Works well" have ENTIRLY different meanings!

 STUUUPID question, if i wanted too install kde.. without using the kubuntu-desktop meta-package, what would i apt-get?
 bullgard4: why?
 bullgard4: ok, as long as I can switch back.. and it doesn't auto-replace gdm
 DingGGu: do-dist-upgrade
 i installed KDE, and i was playing around with widgets, and enabled the bouncing ball with auto bounce, how the #$%^ do I stop it? it's on crack!
 gdea73: what kind of keyboard?
 gdea73: these generalised terms arent helping. what's the error?
 gdea73: "out of disk"? are you sure you have that right
 gdea73: no, pastebin them.
 gdea73: i've never seen that before.. what kind of hard disk do you have?
 eags_: DONT PASTE HERE.
 !pastebin eags_
 gdea73: it looks like your install got hosed. is this a fresh install?
 gdea73: do you remember if you told the partitioner too do anything other than the recommended install?
 who's idea was it too have ubottu PM people. that's really irritating.
 gdea73: AHHA! there's your mistake. grub should allways be in the MBR of the hdd. IE /dev/sda NOT /dev/sdaX
 how come the ubuntu repos are feeding sooo slowly?
 !jpeg
 Herbs: how do i switch?
 [ot] 4:04.. time not found!
 Herbs: even Main is feeding slowly, but faster than US

 jussi: thank you
 DocPlatypus: I had the same problem with my intel audio chips.
 mgj: the fastes way would too be logout, click yor name, change the dropdown menu at the bottom too "Ubuntu Classic" log in and you have panels!
 mgj: the fastes way would too be logout, click yor name, change the dropdown menu at the bottom too "Ubuntu Classic" log in and you have panels!
 mgj: not really.. considering that Unity doesn't have any facilities too change the number/layout of workspaces
 mgj: Unity is QUITE limited when compared too Gnome
 pennnn: logout, click name, dropdown box at the bottom can be changed too Ubuntu Classic. I use that
 pennnn: read my instructions
 sdollins: they can remove from the pre-installed envirnment, but I will never give up my gnome!
 sdollins: why?
 sdollins: i haven't noticed any breakage, but then again, i did a clean install.
 granted, the Natty are SLOOOOOW right now 'cause all the upgrades
 daxroc: why do you say that?
 pennnn: that's a whole 6 months away.
 daxroc: those two examples are driver and Unity related. I notice the opasite, things worrk better in Natty, it's also faster. but to each they're own
 !classic | xs3ns3
 daxroc: true, but i'm on an Aton N455.. and Pinetrail IGP.. my drivers work out of the kernel!
 herol3oy: that's not possible, even with the alternate install cd. you still need a network
 why were the openbios-arch packages not in natty?
 frankS2: "ls" came from gnu-utils.
 frankS2: ok, i wa close.. im tired
