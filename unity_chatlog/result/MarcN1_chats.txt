 wrt my Natty hang on hp2133 notebook, it may be related to wireless.  Disabling wifi seems to stop it from hanging -- and severely limiting its usefulness...
 ohsix: checking.
 ohsix: Broadcom BCM4311 a/b/g rev 02
 ohsix: enabling wifi, to see if that causes a hang
 ohsix: yup Broadcom BCM4311 wifi borks natty on my notebook
 ohsix: I'd be happy with no hangs!
 ohsix: natty &  wifi works on my old hp nc6000 just fine.
 ohsix: and not the hp elitebook 8530w which I think uses a similar broadcom.
 ohsix: technically a hang ;-)
 ohsix: ah, the nc6000 wifi is an Atheros.
 ohsix: Atheros AR5001X+, which is working fine.
 ohsix:  my corp laptop may use broadcom, not upgrading that until natty is out a bit longer
 ohsix: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/772859
 ohsix: tomorrow I'll grab bcmwl-kernel-source and try that route.  Maybe just wipe and see how the install goes.
 Soothsayer: yes that is standard use of /home
