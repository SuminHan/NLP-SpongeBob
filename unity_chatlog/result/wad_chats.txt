 Yay, I got my 11.4 installed and running! Using it now. But.... where is the SYSTEM | PREFERENCES menu?
 Dr_Willis, There they are, thanks!
 hmmm... went to the compiz preferences, and enabled the desktop cube, and enabled OpenGL, and then all the window borders vanished. I can't move windows around anymore.... ideas?
 rcmaehl, ah, thanks. I reenabled it... still now window happiness.
 rcmaehl, okay, thanks!
 Any of you guys know what I need to enable in the CompizConfig Settings Manager in order to be able to resize windows once again?
 So I fiddled with the CompizConfig Settings Manager settings a little bit, and managed to get kind of messed up. Is there any way to reset all of these things to their defaults?
 botcity: Thanks!
 In general, I'm liking the 11.4 release. But there are a couple of issues I've noticed around my dual-monitor configuration: It doesn't play nice when I have one monitor positioned above the other.
 Since I upgraded my laptop to 11.4, my fan runs all the time. It's quite hot. Is this a known issue?
 Enjoying the niceness of 11.04, but I'm not getting the multiple workspaces. I've got this workspace switcher that lets me look at other desktops, but I don't know how to move windows beteen them. I miss my desktop cube....
 bibleboy: How?
