 i'm having problems booting into 11.04 after a successful install on a lenovo w500. I just get a blank screen with a blinking cursor in the upper left part of the screen
 anyone else have problems with a blank screen with a blinking cursor when I would expect ubuntu to start to boot up
 bullgard4: no error messages. after rebooting from intiail install, screen goes blank and there is a blinking cursor in the top left
 bullgard4: left it sitting there for 10 minutes with no change
 bullgard4: nope. tried that
 bullgard4: it doesnt seem like grub is even loading. i do the standard install from cd to install 11.04, goes well and upon rebooting i just get a blank screen
 bullgard4: it doesnt seem to ever start loading ubuntu at all
 bullgard4: i am on the live cd now
 hmm
 bullgard4: /dev/sda1 is full drive3 size, ext4
 bullgard4: /dev/sda4 is extended, /dev/sda5 is swap
 bullgard4: /dev/sda4 is 4gb
 bullgard4: on /dev/sda1?
 bullgard4: nothing in dmesg and no syslog file in there
 bullgard4: i've reinstalled it on that partition twice already with same results
 bullgard4: could grub not be installed correctly?
 bullgard4: i've installed 8.04 on this laptop before so I know the hardware is suitable
 bullgard4: i'll try to reinstall again using gparted instead of letting it autoconfigure
 bullgard4: i'll come back if it doesnt work. thank you for your help
