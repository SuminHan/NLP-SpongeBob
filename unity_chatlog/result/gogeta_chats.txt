 probl couse unity is fail and we all are running other distros
 phoenixsampras: well your better running something like kde these days gtk itsself  has gone downhill after gnome 2 however there is a remix of ubuntu out thats uses gnome 2 on 11.04
 64bit makes sense with anything more then 3gb
 blame flash for being crashy
 Fodi69: unity is fail but shhh
 Fodi69: couse cannel cant let go of gtk
 jiltdil: no but gnome 3 is fail to sooo
 Fodi69: its been buggy and unstable sense the day they launched it in 10.10
 step21: better they fork gnome 2 call it there own
 step21: rather then trainwreck the distro with unity
 hey does btrfs still need a ext4 boot
 jdahm: nooo please dont say lies like that
 diegoviola: no
 diegoviola: 11.10
 diegoviola: maybe
 diegoviola: not set in stone yet
 jdahm: i run kde now soo you can see my thoughts on both of them
 jdeslaur_: not 4.6 yea i hated kde 3 man it was junk
 zachgretzinger: your just packing the jar file into a deb doing that
 zachgretzinger: umm thers no trick your thinking of a launcher
 zachgretzinger: bascily a script along with the jar file to make a menu shortcut and stuff
 zachgretzinger: well you can make a sh script with any icons and use that script to start the jar
 tase: nope relesed and total fail
 wip would mean its not defult
 soreau: hehe why im sporting kde now
 fcuk112: i would say turn off compiz but unity screws you there its forced

 taglass: its unity bascily a relly relly bad ui
 taglass: that uses gnome
 yes and the shell is everything
 the rest is just gtk
 Herbs: why did gnome and cannel decide to screw up gnome
 Herbs: questions with no answers there
 ohsix: gnome shell and unity both sucking
 ohsix: fork gnome 2 problem fixed
 ohsix: becouse gnome 3 droped metacity and are using gnome shell
 ohsix: well i dont care anyways its just gonna spell doom for gtk
 ohsix: you think that
 ohsix: gtk is part of the gnome ui and if people dump gnome in mass due to unity and gnome shell everyone will start uing anything else
 ohsix: acully they did when kde whent downhill and gnome got good
 ohsix: same for e17
 ohsix: i have been around longer then you think
 ohsix: or even xfree

 arand_: what abought btrfs?
 spungo: communty help no cannel
 arand: wow i asked that like forever ago
 arand: so it can be a pure root fs now grub2 finnly supports it
 arand: i did a diffrent hack to install os on compressed fs
 arand: full kubuntu install btrfs compressed 1.2 gb
 arand: still bootable?
 arand: well i made a 100mb ext4 anyways
 arand: being i never got a answer
 arand: but with the zlib enabled i got more space outta my ssd anyways
 arand: its it takes a hack to do it bascily as soon as the installer make the part you remount it with the compression flage
 arand: its aculy very responsiv
 arand: better then when it was uncompressed
 arand: naa the installer does a few things before it acully copys files just do it then
 arand: it doesent notec the swap out
 arand: in fedora you can just add the flage ubuntu hasent added it yet
 arand: so after install you gotta add the flage back to fstab as well
 arand: but it works
 arand: well ill try to install on a zlib compressed root grub2 and see if the system explodes
 arand: ill be compressing everything now even the kernel
 arand: just a test heh
 arand: test machine'
 arand: i kneo it work fine with grub2 having a ext4 boot
 ohsix: yea i wasent having a issue i got the entire os compressed in a sabble state
 ohsix: gonna see if grub blows up in my face if i put it in zlib compression as well
 arand: gotta admit the entire os installed at 1.2gb is impressiv
 arand: for a 4gb ssd
 arand: zlib compressed btrfs root install no error other then the one you said would happon
 Herbs: lol the is your free speech is limited to the ops wims
 irc
 death to unity
 lol
 Icallitvera: kubuntu
