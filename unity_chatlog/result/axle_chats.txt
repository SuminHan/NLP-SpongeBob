 I'm on a very new Lenovo Z370, 2nd generation i5, nvidia geforce 410m. From time to time, ubuntu won't boot, but gives me some kind of an error trace when I boot into recovery mode. It says something like "fixed recursive fault, but reboot is needed". Some times this is the last line of output before it stops, sometimes there are 2 lines about "clocksource" and "tcs" or something like that. When I reboot, I get the same error message ag
 webtrickster: bad idea, very bad idea... I tried it myself, it f*cked up my whole system :/

 rafii: I don't get your point, sorry. I freshly installed 11.04.
 Skei, Incarus6 : not sure what you're talking about, but I'm running ubuntu on a sandybridge quite well, except for the bug I already posted in here :)

 Incarus6: yes. well, atm I'm on win7 because ubuntu won't boot :D
 Incarus6: what upgrade? it's a fresh system, downloaded the .iso yesterday... and well, now it's a little messed up, though it booted all fine the first few times ;)
 Incarus6: yes. I had the same problem with the beta, which randomly booted correctly or gave me the exact same error
 good luck Incarus6 :)
