 So I just installed slim login mgr and rebooted in 11.04 and the menu is not loading
 unity-2d-panel: [CRITICAL] Gtk: IA__gtk_widget_size_request: assertion `GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed
 any ideas on that?
 ShockDoc, install startupmanager and uncheck show splash
 hmm
 it should all be logged in messages
 just type dmesg
 brb, rebooting
