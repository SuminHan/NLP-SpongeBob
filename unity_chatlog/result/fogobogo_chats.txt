 sure
 Eyes_Only: tried a waterproof marker?
 hmm
 Eyes_Only: why not just change the keys then
 Eyes_Only: the screwdriver method might not work but there could be something in the system menu
 Eyes_Only: some crippletop
 Eyes_Only: yeah. but what makes you think that has anything to do with ubuntu?
 Eyes_Only: im under the impression you at least hacked the box to install ubuntu. correct me if im wrong
 Eyes_Only: if it still runs the google spyware i have no clue. maybe the browser settings?
 Eyes_Only: nope. not at all. lucky you i run openbox. get obkeys
 Eyes_Only: well. its a gui for editing keybindings of the openbox wm. so its not flexible at all. but you have a gui
 Eyes_Only: you sissy
 Eyes_Only: the real men's way would be to open ~/.config/openbox/rc.xml and edit your keybindings there manually
 Eyes_Only: unfortunately using a text editor is a dying art :/
 or that
 Eyes_Only: definitely worth to learn vim but as a bloody beginner you might be better off using geany or gedit
 Eyes_Only: because it has buttons and shit
 Eyes_Only: youre welcome
 Eyes_Only: oh hai fellow archer
 :D
 Eyes_Only: way too easy :D

 anthonyl: oh. if thats all

 anthonyl: timidity is just a crappy software midi card anyway
