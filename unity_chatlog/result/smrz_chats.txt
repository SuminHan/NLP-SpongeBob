 After installing natty, rebooting, I get a desktop with no panels, and have no ability to bring up the unity dash... has anyone had this issue? advice to start diagnosing it?
 how do i install nvidia drivers for my system while using a live cd?
 hiexpo there's absolutely no way? i uninstalled the nvidia drivers from my system, and on reboot now the screen is all garbeled
 anyone else getting on natty install no panels?
 i'm just getting my desktop, nothing else, and i can't bring up the dash or anything
 cheapie: no, how do I do that?
 cheapie: trying it now
