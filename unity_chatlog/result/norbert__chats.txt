 hi all
 I just dist-upgraded the Ubuntu on this machine
 I'm looking for a way to get back the overview of what windows are open
 in the south I had a bar that had like a window switcher
 kezzawd: I mean an overview that's always there, that I can directly click on the button/tab (application) I want
 I don't know what version I'm on
 this is Ubuntu, but it has a /etc/debian_version with squeeze/sid in it
 it just updated and there's now a list of icons on the left
 wolfreak: just one at the top
 and I'm looking for a way to get the bottom (south) bar back
 because it had a list of buttons with the applications
 I want to be able to see what I have open
 and it allows me to quickly select the application I want
 without pressing Alt+Tab or Super+W
 wolfreak: thanks :)
 ok
 there's another problem that hopefully will be gone when I go to Ubuntu classic mode
 which is that if I press the "Terminal" icon, it cannot launch twice
 I know I can pick a new Terminal from the top in the menu, but that takes a lot more time than just clicking the icon
 botcity: yeah, but it doesn't allow me to launch the Terminal twice
 botcity: it only allows me to pick from the menu File -> Open Terminal
 kezzawd: ok, but I prefer the icon :P
 anyways, thanks, going back to the old version... logging out... :)
