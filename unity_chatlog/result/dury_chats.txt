 hi there channel :)
 I have created boot in a usb pendrive 11.04... it  boots without any problem...
 the problem is in the installation procedure.... (the box I'm trying to install to it hasn't got cd-rom device)
 and some point in the installation proccess it ask me to put the cdrom
 when is trying to install the apt proccess
 jiltdill: what's that?
 jiltdill: right
 jiltdill: I'm trying to install 11.04 through usb pendrive, right?
 jiltdill: the box hasn't got cd/dvd reader....
 jiltdill: that's ok but in the installation procedure it says to put the cd-rom
 jiltdill: I told you the bios usb devicw it's ok,,, because I already boot it from it
 escott: it boots from the usb pendrive.... the thing it's when is trying to install the apt it ask me for cd-rom
