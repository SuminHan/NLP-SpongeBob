 Can't say I've ever ran Ubuntu much, kinda only one version. Anyway, back when the installer was changed from the good old debian one to the new graphical crap the installer didn't work. Now I have a HDD which may end its life so I wanted a LiveDVD and got Knoppix but later also fetched the latest Ubuntu CD so I could install that on some other HDD. But I've tried booting it with noacpi nolacpi and other options but no su
 ccess. It always crashes either after choosing "try" or "install" or if I choose either from the boot loader as soon as I click the install or firefox icon in the live desktop environment. Machine is an Athlon64 on Via K8T800 motherboard with NV6800LE. Any ideas? I would had been so much happier with a simple installation which actually worked and then try to figure out how to make everything else work than have an instal
 ler try to make everything work from the beginning, fail and then try to figure out why it fails ..

 Anyone got any ideas what to do if the installer crashes as soon as you click any button or icon (choosing language work but that's all), then the CD spins a little, mouse pointer to, and then it hangs. Additional boot parameters?
