 How do I turn on seeing hidden files when browsing home folders in... the program doesn't even say its name anymore, let alone any options o.o
 Yea, just that I can't find the menu bar ever since I upgraded to 11.4
 Aaaah
 It's the global thing! Lol wut
 It's there in window mode as well, just at the total top of the screen mixed with unique buttons... Now THAT's an unintuitive change in design... oh well
