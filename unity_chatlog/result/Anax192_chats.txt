 Hello, people. I'm really sorry for just barging in here and writing like this. I'm kinda short with time and need a little help. Is there anyone available? Again, sorry for no introduction or anything. Oh, and if I have broken any rule by writing like this, sorry about that, too.
 Well, my dad started updating his Ubuntu 8.10, and he interrupted the update while it was upgrading components, I think. I'm not sure. Now he can't boot up. It just stops at the Ubuntu flash screen with four orange dots underneath it.
 I'm sorry, can you just explain what root recovery is? Do I choose that from that list that appears every time I start up my computer?
 Ok, thanks a lot people! I'll try! :)
