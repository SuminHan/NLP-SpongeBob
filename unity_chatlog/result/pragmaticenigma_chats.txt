 ProfessorBacon:  That is the nice part about the linux community... even if Ubuntu stops supporting Gnome 2 there will be others willing to help get it installed
 anybody have any good solutions to getting 11.04 and a broadcom 4306 wireless card working? all the tutorials I find for 43xx only work with 4312 and up
 !ask | luigi_panache
 Ultimate_Chaos: are you upgrading using the CD?
 luigi_panache: Do not PM people, instead ask your question in the main room so others can benefit from the solution
 Ultimate_Chaos: Is your network being unavailable stopping you from performing the upgrade?
 TrentonAdams: disable the desktop effects, your system is going into graphics safe mode
 Moa: does it work when just the tv is plugged in, not using the splitter?
 Moa: you may have already said it but what is the graphics card?
 Moa: I unfortunatly have no experience with the intel chipsets...
