 Hey, I am having troubles with apt-get today. I was trying to upgrade Nginx but it failed and now I can't do anything with apt-get because it says The following packages have unmet dependencies:  nginx-full : Depends: nginx-common (= 1.0.0-0ppa1~maverick) but it is not installed E: Unmet dependencies. Try using -f.
 Of course, I went through the process of trying -f numerous times but it always comes up with the same error
 xangua: beat you to the punch :P
 Any information on how to properly clean apt-get up? I can't uninstall Nginx
 I tried clean
 When I try to install nginx-common I get E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
 bibinou: what exactly am I looking for? I see a lot of half-configured <package>
 bibinou: there's a lot like this: 2011-04-30 13:24:02 status half-configured ufw 0.30.0-1ubuntu2 2011-04-30 13:24:02 status installed ufw 0.30.0-1ubuntu2

 bibinou: yeah, I don't know how to tell it stop trying to install that until I can figure out why I can't install nginx-common
