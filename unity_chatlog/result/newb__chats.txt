 MustardCU1, KM0201, shcherbak, escott: Really thanks for info! I will try the link! Last question: Can I install Unity and change from Unity/Gnome-shell when I want from this PPA? Asking this based on escott question about break unity...

 hello! I'm with the new Gnome3 in my ubuntu (I'm was here some time ago), but how can I change my window theme now? I can't find the option at gnome control center, my fonts are horrible and my wintow theme is worse...
 And finally, I'm running gnome-shell or unity?  I think is g-s,  but the activities panel is strange from default gnome-shell....
 ops, closed wrong window
 Now I'm really confused about gnome3 here. I can't change my fonts? And about the window theme? This here is gnome-shell or unity? or both? My applications place it's different frrom official gnome-shell, but all the other things sounds like it...
 MustardCU1, KM0201, shcherbak, escott: you here?
 KM0201: Today you told me some info about install gnome3 here. I have it now, but I want confirm what is happening. I don't know if I'm running unity or shell. Do you have gnome3 yet?
 KM0201, celthunder: from ps I have g-s running, and no proccess with na me unity. But g-s is strange here, different from standalone testing (tested with a pendrive boot). The buttons "+" and "-" to add/remove new desktops aren't here anymore and applications panel works like in unity: full screen. And the desktops are in a right bar now. If this is a theme, how can I back to default theme?...
 ...There are nothing at gnome-control-center...
