 okay I have some kind of wireless issue. I cannot optain an ip from my router if I use wicd. if I use the network-manager no wireless networks show up. iwlist lists the wireless networks nonetheless.
 and wicd does too
 is there away to see the communication between my wlan card and the router?
 then I'd need network connection first I guess
 well ntop only works with established network connection but I don't get there with my wlan thats why I need a monitor that showes me why I don't get a connection
 anyone else having problems with broadcom wireless and ubuntu 11.04?
 well there aren't many updates on release day :P
 I did but there aren't any updates
 I have the STA drivers enabled riktking
