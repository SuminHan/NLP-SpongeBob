 Anyone able to help diagnose a KVM Bridged networking issue? I just upgraded the host to 11.04 and networking fails.

 Anyone know how to diagnose a network routing issue? I have a KVM host and the guest is not able to contact the network.
 I had the KVm host and guest working before the host was upgraded to 11.04, now something is wrong with routing.
 I already use virtualbox, but against kvm? not a chance for production.
