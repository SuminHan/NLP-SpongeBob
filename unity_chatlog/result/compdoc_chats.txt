 John_Gate, amd or intel are fine. I use AMD for servers running virtual machines. tends to cost a lot less
 mah454, whats wrong with it?
 heh
 mah454, you can try - not sure if my dcc ports are open or not
 mah454, its not receiving - paste the shot online
 skabja, if you search google for 'ubuntu mirrors' you can see the d/l speeds of each site. pick a site thats fast. It took me about 6 mins to d/l 11.04 a little while ago
 Im installnig 11.04 right now, but its stuck: Retrieving file 9 of 30
 mah454, that picture you posted doesnt really show the problem, because another window is in the way. I have no problems. what country and site are you trying to open?
 mah454, maybe its your government blocking it
 mah454, whats the url youre opening?
 Polah, took me about 45 mins when I upgraded to the beta a week ago
 mah454, try the refresh button
 sebsebseb, Im installing 11.04 from cd right now, and its taking forever to d/l files. liekly because of all the uers doing the same thing
 I notice in a fresh install of natty, that services like acpid and irqbalance are not set to run. Are these not needed anymore? I intend to use the box as a qemu-KVM server
 acicula, well, I'm using Boot-up manager, and its the services that start at boot
 can be easy, but sometimes it blows up
 jacobson, I would think apt-get would see the released version as a new update
 always this busy
 this channel is unlike #centos, where they dont like ppl to help each other
 no
 soon
 Im switching all my servers to ubuntu - good bye centos
 lcb, hope it works out for the best
 just rsync, samba, and guests running in qemu-kvm
 doubtful
 cmalo, why do you want to
 santiago, I tried to - but never did
 bc81, I upgraded a couple of systems from 10.10 to 11.04 beta 1 and beta 2 without issues, but they were fresh installs of 10.01
 10.10
 is there a simple way to help a user remotely using vnc? can they share their desktop?
 Liberation Serif
 mikebot
 Liberation Serif is the default font
 mikebot, dont think so, but its probably matching a windows font with a different name
 netflix doesnt work on ubuntu?
 sadly, running a VM doesnt do any better, since you have to use vnc to connect to it. Theres something called the SPICE protocol that is supposed to work much better
 Jessica175, it still connects with vnc
 green is the normal out. your old system could reconfigure any out to work?
 broot, its not finding the disk. have you change the drives around in the case?
 broot, you have a seperate partition for ubuntu?
 broot, boot from a live cd and see if you can find the linux partition
 you booted from windows now?
 broot, boot windows and install a program for me
 broot, install:   http://download.cnet.com/HD-Tune/3000-18512_4-11121758.html
 its free
 tell me when its running
 The Linux Professional Institute Certification ?
 never heard of it
 Dark_Star1, I dont use virtualbox, but bridges are easy
 Dark_Star1, how many network cards are in the box?
 Dark_Star1, good. On pastebin.com, can you post the contents of the file: /etc/network/interfaces?
 right
 Dark_Star1, you use the gnome desktop?
 Dark_Star1, open the menu System>Preferrences>Network Conecctions, is there anything listed in Wired?
 Dark_Star1, delete that, beacuse we're going to set the card manually, and not thru network manager
 Dark_Star1, eth0 uses dhcp?
 Dark_Star1, ok, so you want eth0 to use that static ip? thats cool
 Dark_Star1, try this in your interfaces file. backup the old one if you like: http://pastebin.com/0NPcD91j
 Dark_Star1, any vm that uses the bridge br1 will obtain an ip address from your lan's dhcp server, unless you give the VM a static ip
 Dark_Star1, dhcp tends to be better, but as long as you set the static right...
 thats fine
 Dark_Star1, you do have bridge-utils installed?
 Dark_Star1, you do need that, although you wont be needing to use any of its commands
 Dark_Star1, once that new interfaces file is saved, you have to restart netorking
 Dark_Star1, so you think its working?
 gksudo firefox
 Dark_Star1, like I said - bridges are easy
 kubu2, thats what ppl are saying you should use to run a graphical app
 kubu2, good point
 we're going to use Linux anyway
 insanity99, its either a love or hate relationship
