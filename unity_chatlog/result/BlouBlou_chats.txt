 Elssha: I have the same problem
 hi guys, I joined few hours ago asking about how to fix my gnome-panels, well, I fixed them; I just went to GDM menu and changed the session, I selected 'classic session' and done, problem fixed.
 coco: #freenode
 Lazer-B: should? If you're not using LTS versions, yes
 arangaran: sure, ask it
 arangaran: well, without logs and exactly error I can't see what's the problem
 arangaran: try using another kernel, do you have any older one?
 arangaran: what about 'alternate CD'?
 arangaran: Did you try it?
 Adwait_Neo: maybe #ubuntu-bots ?
 arangaran: well, I don't know then, I just can tell you than Unity doesn't work for me, and I'm using classic-desktop, so there is not big difference between 10.10 and 11.04 on my PC. Anyways, you may want to try Kubuntu, I think it uses the same kernel, but I'm not 100% sure
 coco: #ubuntu-offtopic to talk about it :-)
 jiltdil: go to GDM (login-menu) and select ubuntu-session, normal-session or unity-session
 I am having a problem with ubuntu. It says I have NVidia GeForce 5500 FX drivers 'enabled', but they aren't being used. How to fix it? I want to use them, but there isn't any option to do that

 people only answers easy questions, I don't know why are too many people here
 well, indeed, how to enable ' *not* install ' nvidia drivers?
 samic: Go to Pidgin config and change config in it, enable it to appear in gnome-bar
 nyso: Actually not
 Soothsayer: We are not nvidia-web admins, no idea
 jiltdil: Go to synaptic and search 'flash', install the -nonfree one
 genger: there is no need, just restart when installation finishes and done
 err
 genupulas: ^
 Black_Phantom: I _think_ 1GB at least
 daxroc: just top bar or both dissapeared?
 daxroc: Go to GDM menu (in which you select user) and click on your user. After that select in a small box "classic-session" and join in your session.
 casey: botthing not, but yes with Unity
 booting
 Soothsayer: Well, not for me
 I'm using classic-desktop
 casey: Unity doesn't work, and gnome-bars doesn't appear, so I have to use classic-desktop
 casey: I don't know, I hope they'll do soon
 reena_: If you have more than 256MB, you don't have any problems
 KNUBBIG: Type in a terminal 'sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager'
 KNUBBIG: np :)
 reena_: type 'top' in a terminal
 qkit: Go to GDM menu (in where you select user) and click on your user. After that select 'classic-session' in a small box and log in
 qkit: I mean when you turn on your PC, you see a 'menu' to select the user, right?
 qkit: Yeah! That's what I am telling you for! Select there 'classic-session'
 reena_: I don't know
 qkit: 1 sec
 qkit: I mean below
 qkit: when you're going to ype password, see a box below
 qkit: Oh, I don't know there, can you try to use default GDM menu please?
 It has nothing to do with gnome, it's due to Unity
 qkit: It has nothing to do with gnome, it's due to Unity
 qkit: Okay

 !wtf > Cube``
 Vustom: It means that you can't do anything in a partition if you're using them, so before doing anything, it's needed to unmount

 if I unistall xorg, I won't be able to loging, right?
 guys, just a question
 how to install a package like 'nvidia-glx-96' without unistall xorg and ubuntu-desktop
 ?
 Well, I fixed my graphic card problem. It was installing but not being used. I'll explain how I fixed it for if someone has this error: I unistalled NVdia oficial driver, I rebooted, I installed open experimental driver and I rebooted again. Now Unity works (but anyways I won't use it :P)
 ajin: if you ask something first, sure :)
 ajin: Is it working fine now?
 green_: I had to change nvidia drivers, I'm using open drivers right now and works fine with compiz
 fillayu: unity works with gnome
 fillayu: I don't use it

 muneeb: I don't know

 sexygurl2furl: what problem?
 Geekydude4: 'ctrl + c'
 sweb: you don't need to remove anything. Just go to GDM menu (in where you select users), click on yours, and below, see a small box, in there, change ubuntu session and select 'classic-session'
 sweb: did you read what I told you?
 sweb: Then go to System >> Preferences >> themes or something like that

 ubuntu: nvidia ones?
 yes
 pfifo: are usually bad idea :P
 djazz: works perfectly
 darkham: that may be because they updated config
 darkham: if you want to download a video, try with firefox, 'video downloadhelper'
 darkham: usually is or in .chronium/cache or something like that, or in /tmp
 darkham: Then I have no idea, most probably they changed temporal folder
 np

 hi guys, I'm using a nVidia GeForce 5500FX with nouveau drivers. But when I use Unity, I can't see icons. Any idea of why is this happening?
 Anyone knows why I can't see icons in Unity?
 n-iCe_: You can't with network-manager, it has been removed from there
 n-iCe_: I don't know, try another application to connect. Anyways I'll continue using network-manager, because I don't look at it, if it works fine, I don't need more info :P
 Anyone knows why I can't see icons in Unity? I can click on them, but I don't see any of them
 vak: 'super' (windows logo key)
 untu: Go to gdm menu, in which you select user, and select in a box below user password >> classic-session
 untu: in session-screen, login window
 untu: click on your user and change in a small box bellow user-password box
 noob: it updates with normal updates, if you have all updates installed, you're running last version (no beta)
 noob: That may be because you have old ubuntu and new ubuntu's repos added
 noob: I don't remember command now
