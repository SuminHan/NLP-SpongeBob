 Hello people.
 I had trouble booting up the amd64 10.10 live CD.  Is there a chance it's been updated since I downloaded it some months ago?
 Incarus6: It's a 4 or 5 year old laptop.
 Incarus6: Is there a chance an installation will work better than a live cd somehow?
 spicy: It's the same thing.
 spicy: I'm using amd64 solaris on an intel machine.
 Incarus6: ok.
 spicy: plus, it's politically correct to call the platform amd64 since they invented the platform.
 Incarus6: Haha, ok.
