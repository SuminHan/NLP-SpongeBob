 hi! I updated from 10.10 to 11.04, now my installation is broken (because during update process an error occured). Is there some way to report this to cannonical (with logfiles) so that they maybe can fix this problem, or does this make no sense. later I will simply reinstall
 zvacet, i got a black screen (with upstart-commands from start of 10.10) and the cursor. nothing more worked. then i shut down and did the rest of the install from the shell. but now, some things don't work properly
 zvacet, sorry, I don't understand what you want to say....
 zvacet, you mean, that I should do reinstall if i have backup? yes, i have backup
 zvacet, but first, i thought that maybe it makes sense to report this to cannonical somehow.... or does this make no sense?
 zvacet, maybe they can find a new problem? or a problem that occured also for other users?
 zvacet, ok thanks!
 everyone: how to report broken updates to cannonical? or does this make no sense? if it makes sense; how to do it?
 ubottu, yes, but there are several things broken, because of the update.... is there a way to report the whole state of the installation? so that they maybe can find the bug, if they need this info...?!

 nando, as far as i know, you need 3d acceleration for unity
 nando, is there a open 3d driver for your graphics card? if yes, try this one
 nando, I think for gnome shell you also need 3d acceleration, but im not 100% sure
 nando? what happens? doen't it load unity and gnome instead?
 linuxrocks, yes I had a servus problems.... make a backup first!!!
 nando, so you want gnome shell? and this works or not?
 linuxrocks, error during install: blackscreen
