 Unity stole my window borders. :p
 I have no controls on any of my windows anymore for resize, close, move, minimize, etc.
 elliot_: Windows Key then type what you want to do
 wow, I guess the unity-window-decorator crashed....restarting it fixed my troubles. :o
 that's a bit disconcerting
 at least that it didn't auto-restart itself
