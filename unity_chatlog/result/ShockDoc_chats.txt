 hello!
 anyone here? :)
 does anyone know how I can make ubuntu 11.04 boot in verbose mode?
 I don't want to press ESC every time
 ah
 text
 I've tried verbose
 didn't look
 I'll try using text instead of verbose
 thanks for the help ;
 yeah,I know
 thanks ActionParsnip
 I'm back fellas
 using the "text" option drops me down to a shell :/
 ActionParsnip, any ideas for my grub issue?
 anyone else know how can make 11.04 boot verbose?
 I tried that ruffleS , but is doesn't work :/
 it*
 yes ruffleS
 just tried that ruffleS , didn't work, then it booted into a shell
 I edited my /etc/default/grub about 20 times, still no verbose boot
 k ruffleS , just a sec
 nah Dr_Willis , the grub is brand new :p
 Dr_Willis, ??
 well I think something is wrong with the nvidia drives is what is causing the issue Dr_Willis
 ah, well I'm out of options Dr_Willis  ;)
 now I have GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""
 I'I'm sure of that Dr_Willis , installed to the MBR
 updated, Dr_Willis
 shall I reboot?
 uh yes Dr_Willis
 it used to be so easy to get a verbose boot :/
 well I'll have a reboot, see what happens
 yeah I know, that works Dr_Willis , but that's not what I want, the text thing actually boots to a command line
 brb, gonna reboot
 still nothing guys ._.
 still nothing :'(
 hey guys
 anyone know how I can make ubuntu 11.04 boot verbose?
 it is unchecked morissette
 it still shows me the ugly purple
 hmmm, why can't I get my grub to run at the correct resolution? :/
 it should be KNUBBIG
