 macrossm, what?
 macrossm, bug #1 is windows has the market share.. not osx
 macrossm, when you updated it should have prompted you if you had any conflicting configuration files
 macrossm, yea this not #ubuintu-complain
 Rehan, hodge podge? oh yes but only best hodge podge.
 Rehan, most likely your hardware.. ubuntu 10.10/.04 was incredibly stable
 Rehan, wrong..
 cyoz1, there is always a reason
 maco, to be fair some hardware issues can't be solved that way.. most of them are issues with the manufacturer
 maco, but at least you'll know about them
 maco, at risks of regressions?
 maco, yea its not ubuntu's fault it doesn't work.. its the hardware manufacturer. and as such you should not support any hw that isn't supported in linux
 maco, at this point, not releaseing drivers for linux is a terrible terrible idea
 Rehan, its usually the wireless cards I have issues with
 LAcan, you can swapof
 and if you use lvm you can add it while the system is running
 LAcan, no  not likely but a kernel starved of memory does some pretty terrible things
 LAcan, I hear you can create a swap file and loopback mount it
 LAcan, yea.. but I don't know if you can grow ext3/4 while running the system on it
 LAcan, if you boot into another OS/source you don't even need to swapoff
 LAcan, you should.. and if doesn't let you nuke it then you swapoff
 jnlsnl_, yes you can.. the ssh keys are stored in ~/.ssh
 jnlsnl_, you can also symlink the entire ~/.ssh folder to your user so they always stay in sync
 LAcan, windows will be unable to extend the partition
 jnlsnl_, yes
 LAcan, aye
 escott, but he'll be root :)
 jdahm, it is because you don't have the nvidia driver installed
 escott, only if he symlinks
 jdahm, well.. it could have gotten messed up the install. try using the proprietary driver install tool
 jdahm, oh well is it continueing regardless?
 oh...
 jdahm, what graphics card do you have?
 jdahm, whaaa
 jdahm, isn't the tesla serierss those cuda cards?
 jdahm, well wow... I think you may have a fairly rare card if its a tesla series card.. your bug report would be valuable
 jdahm, oh so its not a tesla or at least it is one but has the chip for the gt 430
 jdahm, and you ahve raid.. damn what system do you have
