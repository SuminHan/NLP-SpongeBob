 hi
 I have 11.04 on my Macbook Air 11inch
 everything works fine
 except the sound.
 The sound doesn't work at all
 :/
 Help!
 It's as if Pulseaudio just doesn't see my sound input and output devices
 yet runnning alsamixer returns the right device.
 Uhhh Hello?
 Urgh
 Sound Not working
 :/
 urgh
 HAlp
 Sound isn't working
 :/
 helphelphelphelphelp
 bitplane: How would I go about making my sound output and input work on 11.04?
 bitplane: It really, really doesn't seem to be working
 bitplane: I'm on a Macbook Air 3,1 if that makes a difference
 bitplane: I've, uhhh, tried that already.
