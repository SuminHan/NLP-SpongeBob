 Dr_Willie, I'm sorry, what were you talking about? ;)
 Willis, even
 coder2, yes
 why not?
 coder2, well these people here know more than me so apparently I'm wrong.
 coder2: besides I never upgrade. I had one bad experience a long time ago so I just save my data files and do a fresh install
 jimcooncat: yeah, it was a grand disaster

 I only try xchat when it's a default install . . . and then I'm reminded why I don't like it

 MattC: Please tell us what the problem is and which version of Ubuntu, etc.
 MattC: which version of Ubuntu?
 MattC: You might try turning the computer off completely and restarting it.
 I know it sounds silly, .... but sometimes that does it
 MattC: do you have any other installs on your hard drive?
 MattC: did you shut the computer off and restart it?
 MattC: ok
 MattC: I don't know what to tell you. Did you check hardware compatibility? Were you running an earlier version of Ubuntu before 11.04? If so, which one?
 uhmm.... what is flameware?
 ok nm
 astro73: I might have missed your earlier posts, but you checked for software versions for Nvidia?

 _Mr_Proper_: I pretty much use anything and it works.
 _Mr_Proper_: I use CLI for burning CDs and DVDs and making iso files, etc. seems to be the easiest, fastest and most reliable
 _Mr_Proper_: you got a corrupt data error when?
 _Mr_Proper_: I use wodim without a problem.
 _Mr_Proper_: what burning software were you using?
 _Mr_Proper_: ahh, see, I have not used that. any of the GUI cd/dvd burning programs have been a problem for me
 _Mr_Proper_: which is why I stick with the command line
 _Mr_Proper_: I literally never have a problem or bad disk
 _Mr_Proper_: for the  most part the GUI dvd burners in Linux are just that .... graphic interfaces for command line programs
