 When I boot natty I get a blank screen, I think I have ruled out a X server issue, but maybe not
 I am having a issue, after the boot splash screen, I get a blank screen.  I can not move to a vertiral console (ctrl + alt + fX).  I have tested ubuntu and kubuntu, with both 64 and 32 bit archs.  This happens both with the live cd and  after install from alternate disks.
 I can get knoppix to boot, anyone wanna tell me where I should start looking for the issue?
