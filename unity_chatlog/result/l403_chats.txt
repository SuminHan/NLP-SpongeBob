 Hi. I'd like to listen to Pink Floyd with my new headphones but I have the ubuntu sounds piercing my eardrum every time I click a button. I am using fluxbox and it doesnt seem to respect the gnome settings where the sound theme is disabled. What is responsible for the sounds and how can I kill them?
 ActionParsnip, I guess I have to log out and log back in to actually get rid of the sounds huh?
 or restart fluxbox? 1 sec
 ActionParsnip, the ubuntu-sounds package is gone, I logged out and back in but the sound theme is still there
 mr_orange, check the logs in /var/log/
 l3 install some metapackage like ubuntu-desktop or something similar
 mr_orange, warning lines should start with WW: and error lines with EE: I think
 mr_orange, try if you can boot into single user mode - terminal with root privilege http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/grub-boot-into-single-user-mode/
 meraqlix, alt+F2 and run xterm
 !help
 what is in charge of playing ubuntu sound themes? where can I disable the themes or kill whatever is playing them?
 AMAG, did you look at your xorg.conf?
 AMAG also check sudo lsmod that lists the loaded modules aka drivers
 !sound > l403
 AMAG, can you run sudo nvidia-xconfig ?

 coun, which slider is that in alsamixer?
 antonio__, #aircrack-ng
 coun, the sound theme is disabled in gnome settings but fluxbox doesnt respect those
 AMAG, I dunno then. reinstall the nvidia package? :-/
 AMAG, Id do all of them that you have installed and have the word nvidia in them :)
 AMAG, boot insto single user mode, install them via apt or aptitude and then just run /etc/init.d/gdm start
 no
 MnCC, filezilla
 lol
 AMAG, I am trying to kill sound events in fluxbox unsuccessfully.. going for a smoke
 sul_ find / "name.jar"
 AMAG, I can msg you my xorg.conf
 AMAG, success. I am done. I have no idea what I did. I just booted into gnome and then back to flux its the sounds are gone.
