 q. is it possible to install ubuntu 11.04 on virtual box ?
 ejv: any doc on it ? my install is stuck
 ejv: have you tried to install it ?
 ejv: hehe
 anybody tried to install 11.04 in virtual box ? how to get it thru ?
 ejv: i understood what you meant
 ejv: right now i need help on ubuntu. so i ask here
 ejv: this is ok if you dont wanna help
 ejv: and installing ubuntu is ontopic
 maxillusionist: to install 11.04 ? any special option ?
 maxillusionist: you said you used virtual box on win, did you try to install ubuntu 11.04 with virtual box ?
 KM0201: ok... this is for the install... once it is installed with the alternate cd, is it possible to run it (even with the 3D issue) ?
 maxillusionist: 700mbyte
 KM0201: oh ok
 KM0201: so the rewritten X requires 3D cards....
 KM0201: anyway to try the new ubuntu without dedicating a computer to it ?
 KM0201: hmmm maybe miscommunication... you said 'unity' stuff requires 3D card and that vbox doesnt support 3D cards... so how could i use vbox
 KM0201: live cd == dedicating a computer to it in my words
 KM0201: and '2D desktop' = gnome ?
 ah ok
 so i need a dedicated computer to install it
 or i can use ubuntu server
 KM0201: ok thanks for the help
 KM0201: just wording i guess
 WARNING: PPAs are unsupported third-party packages <- they mean "supported by third party"
 not nice to say other arent mataining their package
 where is the iso of the alternate install ?
 http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/alternative-download <- alternate install got no .iso only .torrent ?
 thanks
 KM0201: my goal is double 1. to install 11.04 to be able to maintain my ppa 2. to experiment rewritten X stuff
 usually i test in vm, it is simple, fast, easily removable if needed
 feedback "unable to test new stable ubuntu without dedicating a box to it"... wasnt a good idea
 KM0201: ok suppose you boot on 11.04... can you use the box for somehting else ?
 KM0201: when running 11.04, your box is doing only that, so it is dedicated to it
 KM0201: im well aware of dual boot :)
 KM0201: just a matter of working
 KM0201: 'when running 11.04, your box is doing only that, so it is dedicated to it' <- seems correct no ?
 ThinkT510: hehe :)
 KM0201: i understand your definition of dedicated.
 KM0201: relax this is just a matter of wording
 KM0201: 'when running 11.04, your box is doing only that, so it is dedicated to it' <- seems correct no ?
 KM0201: ok no arguement
 i gave my feedback
 ThinkT510: stop insulting
 ThinkT510: seriously, im being kind and all
 ThinkT510: so dont insulte me
 KM0201: relax i understood. you just considere the drive of the box
 KM0201: im considering the cpu this is nothing
 KM0201: hehe ok
 ThinkT510: forgotten
 KM0201: no need to argue
 KM0201: cool, so we disgaree :)
 installing with alternate
 KM0201: we are both confortable
 ActionParsnip: yep,  i need it to install on virtual box apparently. some issue with ubuntu requiring 3D cards and virtual box not providing it
 ActionParsnip: oh ? you tried ? or got successfull story on it ?
 ActionParsnip: or link. anything :)
