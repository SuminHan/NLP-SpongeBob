 Ubuntu Natty repos seem so slow.... 99kbps downloads ugh
 Has anyone tried Classic Session on Natty? I dont wanna use the Unity Integrated menus.
 cholo: Are you kidding me?
 cholo: So they are forcing people to use integrated menus
 Well if they remove the Classic Session option from Natty I will have to go back to Maverick
 I do not like this integrated menus stuff.... It reminds me when MS added the crayola crayon of a taskbar to XP
 ChogyDan: So if they remove Classic from Natty will there be a solid workaround to scrap Unity for Gnome 2
 ChogyDan: Yeah but apparently they plan to remove the Classic option in future releases and force Unity
  ChogyDan: Yeah but apparently they plan to remove the Classic option in future releases and force Unity
 ChogyDan: How can I change repos when doing a natty upgrade so the download process if faster
 Help!.... I am trying to do the Natty upgrade from 10.10 but the download speeds on the repo are insane slow... My eta is over 7 hours.... I have plenty of bandwidth
 Surlent777: Do you know if they intend to keep the Classic option on Natty or eventually force Unity?
 Surlent777: Hmm so if I prefer classic perhaps staying with 10.10 might be best bet
 Surlent777: I just dont like the integrated menus... I hate it.... I love classic panels
 Surlent777: Yeah but when/if they discontinue classic in Natty then I gotta do a workaround to keep classic and that wont be fun?
 yes

 doncams: Use apt-get remove lamp-server
 Flare183: Why not apt-get remove lamp-server ?
