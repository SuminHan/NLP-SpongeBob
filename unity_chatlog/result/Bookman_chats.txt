 I just upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 and now my ATI Xpress200 video card is not working in 3D.  The Additional Drivers does not show anything as being available.
 Since upgrading to 11.04 I seem to have lost my 3D capability on my ATI Xpress200.  Seemed fine before the upgrade.  Not sure how to correct.
 I have an ATI Xpress200 video card and 3D worked very well under 10.10.  Now I've upgraded to 11.04 and I cannot get it to work at all.  Any help?
