 recently bought the verizon mobile hotspot, but everytime i connect to it with ubuntu, the connection drops every 10 sec, any suggestions?
 it's the verizon 4g mobile hotspot
 soreau: not on the same machine, but it works with windows no problems whatsoever
 soreau: i have another laptop with the windows OS, and it connects fine
 i have the latest version of ubuntu (11.04)
