 hi,
 just a question: when i install ubuntu using windos installer it tells me it wants to install on c: where 210 GB are free. is ubuntu going to create new partition(s) or will it erase c:?
 tjiggi_fo: you mean something like a truecrypt-container?
 tjiggi_fo: nvm, thanks so far :)
 tjiggi_fo: alright. but now i started the installation already
 can i simply quit it?
 tjiggi_fo: i did. thanks for your help, i'll partition now on my own
