 Hi all having a bit of a problem. I just got a nvidia gt 430 to hook up ubuntu to my tv. I set the sound settings to use HDA Nvidia Digital Stereo (HDMI) but I do not hear anything coming out of my tv.
 Yes.
 TerryBook I get sound from the cable box, i used alsamixer to unmute everything
 TerryBook, the cabley kind?
 One cable.
 •TerryBook• I unplugged the port the cable tv was using, so it should have sound, the cable did.
 •TerryBook• I don't know how to check the nvidia settings, but I'm using the restricted driver the driver tool wanted to activate.
 •TerryBook• That contains no sound settings AFAIK
 •TerryBook• k thanks!
 w00t i got sound
 Ok if I type aplay -D plughw:1,9 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav I hear sound in my tv. Anyone know what the next step is?
