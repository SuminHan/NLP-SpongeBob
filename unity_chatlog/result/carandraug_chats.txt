 rgoytacaz, I feel your pain. Someone should shot the guys from nvidia for not releasing their drivers for free
 greylurk, the first time I made a upgrade on the day the release came out, it took me 8h!
 tanath, the dependencies are not removed if you install from things such as synaptic or ubuntu software center. If you want dependencies to be removed, you need to installl with apt-get or aptitude
 tanath, then I don't know. Maybe you have something else installed that needs those dependencies
 laumonier, pastebin "aptitude search transmission" please
 tanath, see "aptitude show package_who_does_uninstall"
 cntb, then don't upgrade
 cntb, I mean, people tend to prefer the latest version, but if it works for you, then don't upgrade. It may just create more problems. I'd give it a 2-3 weeks before thinking upgrading. I'm still using 10.04
 cntb, It should be available on the update manager every time you go there
 cntb, yes. I upgraded to 10.10 but went back because I had some problems with the unity interface. I liked it but it was still to slow and had a few bugs that made it incomaptible with Gnome DO
 tanath, when you run "aptitude show package_name", does it says "Automatically installed: yes" somewhere on the output?
 tanath, I mainly use Gnome DO to open programs and folders, and shut down the computer. Not the plugins so much
 tanath, yes. But is it marked by aptitude as automatically installed? If you run that command, it should say
 tanath, I'll give it a try, thanks. By the way, Gnome DO was developed by the same guy behind Unity
 nmvictor, I gave a look at the plugins. But I spent most of my time on gedit and a terminal. And have shortcuts on the keyboard for pretty much everything else I do so I don't need them much
 tanath, same here. The most weirtd thing was that they conflict with each other. You try Super +space and Unity intercepts it
 taglass, I find the best way to have something done on free software is to report the bug, request a feature. If already has been requested, say that you also want it. And if you can code, submit a patch. The last thing works for me every single time :p
 !pt | gilmar
 cntb, you can't go back. I had to reinstall 10.04
 taglass, it's really good. I'm no programmer but started slowly by fixing erros in man pages and documentations. Then on small simple scripts. It just sucks you up in and before you know it, you're sending patches to the devs to fix all your bugs and half your drive is the trunk version of the programs you have installed. Free software is amazing like that
 cntb, what do you mean? Grub only points to the linux kernel. Even if you kept the old one, when you upgrade to 11.04, you'll upgrade every bit of software you have installed. All of them will be on the lateste version. It has nothing to do with GRUB
 ubuntu, the way I see it, if it ain't broken don't fix it
 ubuntu, http://xkcd.com/349/ <-- like this
 tanath, ahahahah! Too true
 asiekierka, oh! Someone here was complaining about the NVidia drivers just a few minutes ago
 ubuntu, looks better and works better are very relative things
 greylurk, is it true it's the default now, even for the desktop version?
 ubuntu, you can upgrade to 11.04 and still keep the classic gnome
 greylurk, on the netbook on 10.10 looked nice but way too slow for my very old computer
 asiekierka, no. I only use graphics card from intel that don't give problems. I said someone here a few minutes ago was having problems and I think fixed by installing the OSS version of them
 greylurk, mayb I should upgrade mine. 1GB RAM, 40GB of HDD and a single CPU of 1.6GhZ
 asiekierka, I think it was rgoytacaz
 rikrikthetik, not as root. With sudo
 greylurk, I have an even older one. But that's running Debian testing :p
 ubuntu, see you. You come back some other time and help other people too. Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside
 superproxy, you don't. When booting from the CD, there should be an optiomn to check CD for defects
 kjxl9, go to preferences > monitor. Should be there
 kjxl9, at least on the old version was that. On th new version, with unity, if memmory doesn't fail me, just type monitors on the search box
 BKTech86, you can do it with cfdisk I think
 BKTech86, just do "sudo cfdisk /path-to-device" and be careful to just change the bootable flag
 cuddlefish, that's why there's LiveCD
 BKTech86, did it work?
 cuddlefish, sorry about your bad experience. Can't help you with it, I only have a integrated intel graphic cards 8 years old
 BKTech86, so what's the problem now?
 BKTech86, ok. Good to know
 AndroUser, you heard wrong
 jprobe, you sure? Try a torrent search engine. Yous hould be able to find it on isohunt
 jprobe, I just searched therer and found it. You want the desktop, server or alternate version?
 Juest, 11.04 already cmae out. He's asking on the right place
 uhuhuh, on the previous versions there was a "main menu" on the preferences where you could remove the entries from the menu. Not sure on 11.04 but shouldn't be too diferent
 jprobe, no problem
 uhuhuh, oh! I haven't tried unity yet so can't help you with that. Maybe it'll update the list when you restart unity. Try log out and log back in
 !problem | sancas
 heyguise, I think it allows to search for files based on modification date
 heyguise, makes searches faster because it shows first the files and applications you used more frequently on the last times
 xion56, as far as I know no. xmms2 is a completely different thing by the way
 mistervinblack, which one?
 mistervinblack, there's several kinds of VPN. And I'm assuming you want to connect to someplace through VPN and not install a VPN server yourself
 !vpn | mistervinblack
 mistervinblack, ubottu is a bot. You ask him stuff with commands, for example !vpn and he'll tell you about it
 mistervinblack, no. Just enter "!vpn"
 mistervinblack, there's a lot of commands. You can ask him on a private window to not fill the channel
 Juest, you must run visudo
 Juest, you can try with a normal text editor but then there'll be no check after editing. And you may end up with an unusable sudo conf file
 Juest, I don't know. After editing the file, before saving, visudo checks if there's something wrong and if there is, it doesn't save
 Juest, but to tell the true, I'm fairly confident on my skills at editing the sudoers file and always use nano or gedit
 Juest, I feel your pain bro. I'm not one either
 Juest, I was reading visudo man page and it seems you can ask to use another text editor such as nano
 Juest, everyone knows who to use nano
 Juest, seriously. Everyone knows how to use nano, even if they never tried it before. Or at least the basic things. You move with the arrow keys, and write and delete with the rest of the keyboard. There's no command and insert modes. And all the commands you need are written on the bottom of the window all the time

 spacemagic, not if installed 11.04 over 10.10
 researcher123, no
 researcher123, you'll have to upgrade first to 10.10
 DeathAtNight, there was on the previous versions. There should also be on 11.04
 DeathAtNight, did you search for sega on the ubuntu software center?
 DeathAtNight, hmmm. I'm on debian now and have yabause (sega saturn) and dgen (genesis and MegaDrive)
 DeathAtNight, did you found dgen on ubuntu?
 DeathAtNight, awesome. Good luck with it
 researcher123, should be somewhere on the update manager window
 TrentonAdams, choose ubuntu-classic on the startup. But give unity (the new look) a try. It's very very different but there's good things about it too once you get used to it
 Wildman, of joy?
 Wildman, do you have a problem to ask? If it's just chatting, please go to #ubuntu-offtopic
 jgould, yes. Can't remember their names though. You can probably find it on google
 jgould, I found it. It's called build-essential
 truepurple, the only one both will recognize natively is FAT. NTFS also works well on ubuntu now. The problem with these choices is that it doesn't allow Linux to control permissions the way it likes
 ball, yes.
 ball, wait. What? I only read the first line. please make your question in one line, you got me confused. Could you explain better?
 kins, just say what's the error when you try to connect it. If someone can help, they will
 Name141, if your system is not 64-bit
 Name141, I know on the old times, some software had problems on 64-bit. Specially flash player. I don't think this old true anymore but all my machines are still 32-bit
 Name141, like I said, I don't know because i never used the 64-bit. But I'd have to guess I'd say yes
 casey, I subscribe sebsebseb opinion. Stick with GRUB
 !phpmyadmin | shmup
 dijonyummy, you still get the icons on the panel if you install with aptitude
 TrentonAdams, sorry, at this hour (5am here) I can't think of what may be wrong
 TrentonAdams, I will soon. But still have work to do
 TrentonAdams, try "metacity --replace"
 TrentonAdams, did you try to change the theme on appearance preference window?
 TrentonAdams, I don't know. Sorry. I'm going away now. Need some sleep
 Froq, it's on the ubuntu repos
 Froq, use the ubuntu repos, not kernel.org if you want to compile exactly the same thing
 mathmoi, I think for the minimal install it's the alternate install, not the server
 cntrational, go to the monitor preferences and change it
 cntrational, on the old times you could edit xorg.conf. But I think ubuntu doesn't use X anymore so I don't know how to fix it
 rgr, wasn't it vchanging to wayland?
 cntrational, rgr, oh! I thought they were going to change now on 11.04. Can you say I haven't upgraded yet? :p
 cntrational, can you look into /etc/X11/xorg.conf then?
 rgr, I really thought they had it changed on this new version. Sorry
 cntrational, then run sudo Xorg --configure
 rgr, he doesn't have a Xorg.conf file to backup
 cntrational, are you using only 1 monitor?
 cntrational, I googled a bit and some people say you need to stop X before running that. That means you'd have to go to a tty, and stop the GUI for some time
 cntrational, ok. Could you pastebin the X log then?
 cntrational, pastebin the contents of /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 cntrational, well, I can't find any error there
 cntrational, what resolution should it be?
 cntrational, I have to go now. But take a look at this, it might be of help https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Adding%20undetected%20resolutions
 cntrational, and good luck fixing it
 Toph, I think that message was directed to Cale, not me
 Toph, no problem. Just wanted to want you since you probably want to say it again with the proper nickname prefixing it
 Hi! I've been contributing for several projects. They all use different revision control systems. I have SVN, git, mercurial and bazaar and I'm starting to confuse them. I just tried to do a git update on a hg repository. Is there any program that checks which system is the correct and translates to the correct thing?
 Maahes, I don't want to convert them all to one. I was looking more for one program that would look into the directory I was messing with and "translated" correctly. For example, urcs update /path_to_local_repo. It would check which system is on that repository and then do hg update or git pull according
 ohsix, oh! Now I see what they mean. Thanks
 Maahes, hmmm.. I love gedit. Wonder if there's a plugin for gedit that does it. Thanks
 Hi! On gedit when using the terminal on the bottom pane, is there a keyboard shortcut to move from the text editor are to the terminal and from the terminal back to the text edition?
 tastywheat, on the login window at boot, after selecting you name, choose ubuntu instead of ubuntu classic on the session drop down menu
 Hi! Is there a keyboard shortcut on gedit to move between the embedded terminal on the bottom pane and the text area?
 Hi! Is there a keyboard shortcut on gedit to move between the embedded terminal on the bottom pane and the text area?
 victorhugo289, I believe so, yes
 arquebus, go to preferences and there's a plugin called Embedded terminal. It will appear on gedit bottom pane (activate on the menu View or Ctr+F9)
 arquebus, no problem. If you never looked into them, there's also a side pan where you can have a character map, and file browser. Soooo handy
 plan_rich, use a LiveCD for that
 I want to report a bug but I don't know to which package I should. What's the application that organizes the windows? The one that "reads" the "Always on top" option of windows (in GNOME). Is it metacity? I'm still using 10.04
 edbian, I don't have. So it should be metacity. Thank you
 edbian, I did. metacity is running
