 r000t: thats an odd problem
 r000t: what software do you use that might be doing passive grabs, or are you using an ime? or did you mess with xorg's priority
 r000t: find out what the first two mean and investigate the software you are running
 r000t: also paste the output of xlsclients -al to a pastebin
 OchoZero9: did you install kde? it is normal
 r000t: what is "exe", and that unknown entry?
 r000t: use xprop -id with those window id's and pastebin the output
 nutsfornatty, hypetech: w4m
 MarkSS: #ubuntu-offtopic
 r000t: what about the unknown window? and does this backspace thing happen the same in all apps
 MarkSS: there was a coup after the oracle thing, they're not the same but libreoffice is the one most developers left to, since oracle wasn't going to form a foundation for the project
 r000t: my overall point is that it's not from the upgrade, but it can be found out where it is
 jsebean: #ubuntu-offtopic
 jsebean: intel or nvidia?
 jsebean: report a bug
 Somelauw: #ubuntu-offtopic
 ThomasUK: #ubuntu-offtopic
 MarkSS: #ubuntu-offtopic
 ThomasUK: it's not ego, this channel exists for a reason, and that is not it
 epyx: #ubuntu-offtopic
 MarkSS: #ubuntu-offtopic
 helo: sure, if they don't know about anything it'll be their computing experience
 macrossm: it had it, you weren't paying attention
 unity is a plugin for compiz
 jsebean: no, it is not a replacement for gnome
 jsebean: 99.99% of what "gnome" is, is not the window manager
 jsebean: report a bug
 jsebean: i saw a lot of that long before the release even, nobody filed bugs
 cyoz1: no, it's a compiz plugin, try ccsm
 macrossm: they're still there
 macrossm: they were just displayed by nautilus before
 sebsebseb: do you speak for them?
 nutsfornatty: you have it, open ccsm
 sebsebseb: if you've "read" things, chances are you know nothing
 sebsebseb: nope, unless canoncical said it, it's speculation
 macrossm: gnome is not gone, you can still use it as a desktop session, pick it from the login screen
 Coty91: conversely, they did not have infinite time, and it was released
 ThomasUK: unless you have a question or are assisting someone i suggest you take your comments elsewhere
 Coty91: :[
 nutsfornatty: are you promoting that post?
 macrossm: unity is a plugin for a window manager
 nerdshell: is it a broadcom or ralink chip? (lspci / lsusb)
 sebsebseb: there is no plan, unless you speak for canonical and are making said plans, do not spread misinformation
 nerdshell: you probably need to install the firmware then, as it's not redistributable
 macrossm: are you trollling with these guys?
 sebsebseb: then hold your tongue, it would only be appropriate to discuss on #ubuntu-offtopic anyways
 macrossm: it is an option
 macrossm: it is just the default
 nerdshell: firmware filenames change with kernel versions, look at the output of dmesg and see if the driver is finding it's firmware
 sebsebseb: #ubuntu-offtopic
 macrossm: you have had many months to try it out gradually
 nerdshell: dmesg shows kernel messages if ran in a terminal; the driver says when it's loading its firmware; so you check that it has
 corecode: you can adjust the ccsm settings, but i don't know if you can; smspillaz had a blog post about getting overlapping shadows to not over darken & i think thats the fixed output from that
 corecode: fixed in the sense that there are few options iirc, but the ones there are will be in ccsm
 corecode: that somewhere might not be something you can change without a rebuild, is what i was saying
 macrossm: unity did not do that
 macrossm: compizchanging from version .8 to .9 did
 macrossm: it tries to migrate some settings but far from all of them are migrated
 macrossm: you can manually transfer the settings, they are still in gconf
 cherva: hunt has a tool to do that, it discovers sequence numbers and sends rst's to both ends
 cherva: i think theres a tool to do just that, but i  forget the name
 Rehan: one of your ppas is broken, you should purge them all before you attempt an upgrade
 macrossm: that is your opinion, and you had an opportunity to voice it before release
 macrossm: as i've said your compiz settings are still there, they are just not being read by compiz .9
 laserbled: everything that exists to do it only does uncopmressed archives
 laserbled: aufs can do it but it is no better than extracting it entirely, because that is what it does
 Dominater: unity is compiz, with a unity plugin
 macrossm: you are not listening to me
 macrossm: if you are going to persist you will be removed
 macrossm: i am running compiz, you are lying to people
 macrossm: and this is a help channel
 macrossm: i even explained why you are seeing what you are seeing
 !ops
 maco: no fire, didn't realize you were an op, just needed eyes
 LjL: noted
 IdleOne: for macrossm
 macrossm: #ubuntu-offtopic
 nerdshell: hm thats interesting
 nastjuid: there is no new gnome, there is a new default session that uses compiz and the unity plugin as a window manager
 nastjuid: iit's on the login screen :]
 nerdshell: to check if that is the case (that maco said) you can run sudo iw reg getin a terminal
 nerdshell: it will tell you the current regulatory restrictions
 maco: thanks for telling people that, i don't have  the energy for it :]
 azi`: pick "classic desktop" on the login screen
 ugh autologon
 azi`: you know your keyring has to be insecure to do that as well
 nerdshell: "sudo iw reg get"
 azi`: thats a big tradeoff :[
 Rehan: that is incorrect
 hardly
 it depends on people reporting bugs
 cyoz1: theres a  reason, interested in finding it?
 Rehan: problem #1 is searching forums for _solutions_
 Rehan: at best workarounds, at worst nobody knows what is going on and can't elaborate; so practically speaking, a waste of time if you actually desire remedy
 Rehan: search bugs
 Rehan: lacking said bugs, report bugs
 Rehan: then the maintainers/packagers will be participating & they can do more than guess or tell you to do something awful that nobody really knows is awful, but accept as valid workarounds
 Rehan: the definition of stable is fixed & supported, by backports of fixes or otherwise
 nerdshell: ok sec
 sgaap: it comes with one
 uofm49426: do you mean ram or the BAR/pci stuff?
 ejv: the one phoronix speculates about you mean?
 Rehan: yea probably bad luck
 Rehan: worst case for me out of lots of trials is nonworking feature keys
 ejv: thats what they do, unfortunately all that they do
 ejv: fwiw i have seen very slight temp increases, but if it affects battery life, on my laptop it's like 3 minutes out of 2 hours
 ryankask: getting a black screen? intel or nvidia
 ryankask: and the other question?
 ryankask: ah, intel then?
 ryankask: reclocking lvds can do that, but it's a bug, reporting it with a picture should be enough, the intel developers know what it is
 [dlp]: bad advice :[
 ryankask: well, you can use xorg-edgers after the install probably, chances are it already includes the fix, but with respect to ubuntu it needs the bug reported so they can backport the fix
 adwonw: pick the other session on the login screen
 [dlp]: bad advice
 [dlp]: doing what he asked to do
 ryankask: you'd need to add it after the natty upgrade
 acicula: run ecryptfs-setup-private from a terminal
 [dlp]: you very well may, but acicula would not know all the implications of encrypting everything without a lot of work; simply suggesting he enable it is a bad idea
 acicula: encrypted private, you do not want to encrypt everything :] just move the important things to encrypted storage
 acicula: it's for sure not default; people might think they want that but it's a horrible idea
 acicula: my fresh install has no encrypted storage and no clear means to enable any
 acicula: i know what you're saying, i'm saying it is no default and a silly idea
 acicula: but all the ecryptfs utilities are there, you can do what you like
 ryankask: launchpad.net, do you see that pattern _at_ boot or does it change after a while, like when the login screen might have started being displayed
 [dlp]: no, pam can mount it with your credentials; that is something else
 ryankask: ok, then xserver-xorg-video-intel is what you probably want to file it against
 [dlp]: a tutorial or article on how to do it will not tell you the implications of doing so
 acicula: i hope you read about the implications before you lose everything in an overreach
 ryankask: i saw that
 acicula: then that is dumb
 acicula: where are you seeing that it's some default? you just said you need to pass --all-home to do it, what default is that?
 acicula: default has a very narrow meaning with ubuntu
 acicula: for example, banshee is now a "default"
 acicula: ok, it did not ask me that for 10.10 or 11.04, and that is something the installer would do, not a "default"
 acicula: you can pick btrfs in the installer as well, but that's not a "default"
 acicula: i hope you have your machine under lock and key
 acicula: i'll take your word for it
 acicula: it's important to segregate information that actually needs to be secure/encrypted, you are no better off encrypting everything without segregating things
 acicula: of course it's a cool thing to do; and people hear encryption and think its awesomr
 ryankask: i915?
 ryanakca: upstream is on freedesktop, but you want to report it on launchpad so someone can port a fix to a release
 vanguard: my big trouble was migrating my compiz settings
 kire: the action binds were pared down, just rebind the button in ccsm
 [dlp]: encryption doesn't solve you losing physical security of your encrypted information
 nutsfornatty: gnome comes with a keyring too
 vanguard: nay, if it was just that, it wouldn't need to be said
 vanguard: in fact i'm quite insulted, but compiz changed versions and .9 doesn't read the old settings, and the thing that migrates some of the settings miss a _lot_ of them
 nutsfornatty: yar i use keepass on my phone
 mictlantecuhtle: is it all windows or just firefox, and are you using an nvidia card?
 vanguard: it's not a blocker, but if you care that something was adjusted by .02 to suit your prefences, look forward to manually migrating your settings
 mictlantecuhtle: is it a geforce mx or some similar older card?
 [dlp]: assume a well equipped adversary, you say "more difficult", how much more" part of even bothering is quantifying the risk; use of such language probably betrays that you don't care or don't take it very seriously
 vanguard: ok, your old settings are preserved in gconf; so if you do need to, you can, you may not have to; i just had quite a bit of daily tweaks in mine
 mictlantecuhtle: OK; there are texture size limits on some older cards, it might not work well & the only solution that might be offered is blacklisting it due to the limitation, do you know if you are using the proprietary driver?
 Macer: pick a mirror in software properties; it will measure the speed of all of them :]
 OchoZero9: not really, at least not with http
 m4rtin: thanks
 Macer: do something about it
 d3vlin: don't anthropomorphise software ;] it has no intelligence
 Macer: scroll up and see what m4rtin said
 Macer: ah theres a text based thing that does the same but i think it's been removed; you can manually change your sources.list to a closer mirror though
 mictlantecuhtle: you might need to reinstall the proprietary driver; it's likely using nouveau, if it is you should probably report a bug about it, b ut the proprietary driver might suffice for  now
 Macer: i just updated and the mirror i use wasn't any slower than normal
 pumeust: because software often has nothing to do! or is waiting for something it needs
 mictlantecuhtle: please report a bug if you've found one with the nouveau driver :]
 doncams: it's a plugin for compiz
 POOPHAMMER: if it's not starting on its own what are you going to force it to do?
 [dlp]: you're the one thats quantified your risk ... it's part of the job, yes
 [dlp]: what is your plan for rubber hose token disclosure?
 you can "lose" a laptop and lose a laptop as well
 acicula: the whole discussion is, i just said it was bad advice
 Gosha: because it hardly does anything? as a compiz plugin you can adjust its settings inccsm
 neryour data is in /home, possibly /etc; if you don't do anything to delete or modify those places you won't lose it
 pumeust: linux is not comparable to windows; and yea what ayecee said
 RAMPKORV: how did you install it? it should be using nouveau on 11.04
 RAMPKORV: delete your xorg.conf and restart
 [dlp]: but what if they do; you after all have very important data that a known adversary desires access to
 RAMPKORV: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 acicula: to suggest encrypting everything
 [dlp]: then what information do you have to protect? a casual thief is a known adversary, maybe not who that person is, but an adversary
 [dlp]: with infinite time and effort your adversary will get what you want to protect; and has lots of ways to lessen that time, you need to account for the risk with the information
 [dlp]: the bad advice was given here; the reasons why its bad should probably be elaborated a little in here; but that's been done
 [dlp]: "a few years" is a contraint on the information you want to protect, and as i've said that's just the principle axiom; they can and do have means to take less than infinite time
 [dlp]: another case i've personally accounted for is for family to have access to most of my information in the even that i disappear
 LjL: if [dlp] wants to continue we can do it in msg :]
 mmiller235: it'd be a virtualbox problem with the gpu emulation most likely, no?
 [dlp]: you are making a facile argument against "encryption", not against how people will acquire your information regardless of whether encryption is employed or not
 [dlp]: message me if you wish to continue
 yes
 if guys knew what you wanted help with
 mmiller235: i haven't had much luck with anything in vbox D:
 kshawkeye: pick a faster mirror in software properties
 jkr801: disabled kms? or no video
 jkr801: right, but is it totally devoid of video hardware
 jkr801: you can ignore it then, unless it's preventing mountall from working, then report a bug
 damiano: theres a manual for lighttpd, and the ubuntu admin guide online
 ayecee: the bar isn't anything like the old panel; you're right, but they aren't applets
 zatan: the login or the long name?
 zatan: the user editor lets you change the long name; changing your usernameis harder but not impossible, you move your home dir to the new name, change passwd, shadow, group; then use find to find files owned by the old uid and set them to the new one
 zatan: you can also add the new name with useradd & leave the home d ir as is, then change permissions
 zatan: there are lots of ways to do it
 zatan: it might be a great idea to back things up until you are sureyou got it right
 zetheroo: if you want the panels (and their customization) back, log in with the classic session
 zetheroo: then you get what you get
 Samsagax: same for you :]
 zetheroo: you've been told your options, you disagree; apparently with how it used to be as well, not just hoe it is now
 zetheroo: you said you didn't want to use the classic session, which has panels and is the same as before
 zetheroo: why bother indeed, shouldn't you have asked yourself that before you did it?
 zetheroo: that is desired, use what you like
 zetheroo: you presume you would have? you're setting up a strawman you know; you could have provided useful input for months, but you're here now, when you can just use what you're familiar with
 zetheroo: unfortunately you can't go back in time and communicate this
 zetheroo: well it's not "anti" either, idon't know why you are here
 zetheroo: you know even gnomes panel isn'e enough to sate a lot of people? i hope you understand it's all relative & the line you've drawn is just as arbitrary
 zetheroo: some would call that a good thing, myself included, but i run the machines for my family
 zetheroo: it's not, it's just different, the options for the unity plugin & the rest of compiza are available in ccsm
 zetheroo: the "panel" is nearly vestigial now, it serves no purpose like it did in gnome proper
 zetheroo: isn't that that choice you were just talking about? i'm not sure what you're asking
 zetheroo: same place you did before, on the panel; whats in unity is not a panel
 zetheroo: you'll really be boned w/gnome-shell, enjoy what you have now
 zetheroo: i'm not saying that; i'm saying you want a panel; use the session with a  panel
 zetheroo: not what you are asking, it is not a panel, i said what settings there _are_, some are available there
 zetheroo: so the panel, noted
 zetheroo: why? so people can see a menu they can't do anything with anyways? you're presuming an educated user, an educated user can already get what they want with the classic session
 TerryBook: that would be an application feature
 nutsfornatty: indeed, you need to whitelist things that work for them to even show up
 who isn't, did you have a question
 Monotoko: whitelisted
 zetheroo: it's also not the past, they are concurrent
 zetheroo: you are making an argument for no change at all, unity would be useless if that were the case, if you do not want something different, use what is familiar
 zetheroo: don't be stupid, unity is a plugin for compiz
 Monotoko: theres an article on the wiki about it, basically if it fits the aesthetic/function standards it will be whitelisted
 zetheroo: follow that thread, you keep adding and not removing, what do you get?
 zetheroo: the useful moves are removing old things you thought you were wed to; then you get a completely new experience and get to decide if it's sufficient
 zetheroo: there is no panel; the panel did all the things you desire, full stop
 Cryovat: not many people use multiple monitors, you should see about communicating how it can be improved
 zetheroo: then you use what is
 RAMPKORV: nice, thats tough though, the proprietary drivers only do xinerama; and they fake it, and only because the drivers don't do xrandr 1.2+
 RAMPKORV: thank nvidia :D
 RAMPKORV: you could try the nouveau driver, it does xrandr
 zetheroo: not as quick for your trained behaviour, someone with different experience will have different circumstance
 Cryovat: thats not far from the truth; you know netbook sales swamp notebook sales right? and notebooks beat desktop sales
 zetheroo: you are one person, introduce a third with different experience from the first, accomodate all 3?
 zetheroo: take that to the possible number of all possible linuxusers
 zetheroo: thats just to say, the important thing is you are advocating your preference, which is fine but not objective, and as stated already would lead to no change
 zetheroo: it's not about new, or being complex
 zetheroo: it's about nobody freshly introduced to it, needing to do it at all
 i think a whitelist would have been a good start
 zetheroo: you forget your a-priori information you carry from gnome
 zetheroo: they will probably not even think about it
 zetheroo: my mom uses classic but she doesn't know or care that she can change things
 zetheroo: you still have a special case; if you weren't arguing for your preference already it might even be notable
 zetheroo: people aren't computer saavy, they're merely more familiar with some concepts
 zetheroo: you find that the concepts change and you find some saavishy confused people
 zetheroo: you are arguing for you, you want it,  you are saying you see other people want it to give you some sort of credit for having asked for it
 zetheroo: like i said, "computer saavy" is an empty statement
 zetheroo: people aren't car saavy, they can just understand pedals and a wheel after some instruction,  you change the pedals or the wheel, they'll want what they know back
 zetheroo: vast experience of people inflatingt themselves into "people" and insisting their not arguing poorly for their own ends, but the "peoples", you are deluding yourself
 zetheroo: i'm me, and my persona experience with my mother,i'm not oresuming to speak for untold numbers of people that happen to agree with what i'm trying to have done
 zetheroo: common sense is a red herring, often used as a cudgel; like "you don't think like me"
 zetheroo: nobody has said it was change for the better, and without time nobody will know, it is merely different
 zetheroo: i'm fine thanks
 even post gnome-shell i'll be using the panels & nautilus, so i really couldn't care less
 unfortunately the panel or something like it is make or break for me
 Chubcorp: how do you tell what? you should try deja-dup, it's nice; and will start missed backups when you plug the backup volume back in
 talntid: wat
 triunity: upgrades work, unity is like .001% of all of the gnome situation on natty; just use the classic session if you wish
 likki: i'd check what extensions you're using, anything outside of firefox isn't going to do that
 triunity: if you have compiz settings you want to migrate you will probably have to do it manually
 triunity: since it's been updated to .9, and theres a migration thing but it misses about everything
 triunity: well they ditched mutter & made it a compiz plugin so it works a lot differently
 hypetech: ugh
 Chubcorp: just use deja-dup; don't mess with stuff in the terminal
 hypetech: have you assured physical security and taken into account all the other things you need to do to make encrypting everything even remotely worthwhile?
 hypetech: encrypting everything is a bad idea, you ensure all the things stored in there are as either equally in need of securing, or equally worthless
 hypetech: if you just want to be cool and tell people stuff is encrypted i'd seriously advise against it
 hypetech: segregate what is actually important to secure & assure its phsyical security
 xinel: there is lots wrong with it
 xinel: like i said, you make everything asuseless or everything needing the same security measures, there is no halfway, and there is a lot that can happen that renders the encryption moot
 xinel: an enitely encrypted drive is no better than an entirely unencrypted drive most of the time
 hypetech: that doesn't help either, you had sensitive information on plain storage; that is already a mistake
 hypetech: a token on your person with your encrypted information is 100% no fault in case of theft and _more_
 hypetech: `if they have access to  you and your token themn they have access to the ecrypted volumes
 acicula: how do you measure "most people"? you know most thefts are from people  you already know, and they might even know your password already
 acicula: i'd ask that you keep your baseless statements there as well. then
 hypetech: decide what is important, separate it, secure it
 hypetech: much like a gun without a lock won't be protected by your front door if it can just be kicked in
 acicula: it is not, unless you tell people they can lose access to their information if it is damaged or they forget their passphrase as well; or that i t essentially can't be changed without recreating the volume, there is a _lot_ with suggesting people ust encrypt everything with no regard to why, it is not free and often doesn't get them what they actually want either
 acicula: does it tell them about changing their authentication information?
 acicula: password rotation is going to do a lot more good with casual intrusions than an encrypted volume will, the volume will be mounted the entire lifetime of the machine being on, you can't unmount it
 chotaz: if you want to hibernate, at least 2/3rds the ram you have
 chotaz: if you havelike 16gb of ram you can use less, since it won't all be in use :D
 acicula: you cant make suppositions then not accept the answer & redirect
 it is plainly bad advice
 [dlp]: i always suggest at least 512m even if you have lots of ram;if only because there are pages in the vm that need never exist in memory in most cases & would just waste ram
 [dlp]: also even memory hungry programs vary their access patterns, so theres no real rule of thumb, aside from hibernating :]
 [dlp]: mine is 3g, swap is usually 1-4g in use
 [dlp]: my working set is huge though, i really should get more ram
 [dlp]: it's not random but it's close; and you can turn off overcommit
 (if it's a real concern)
 well, mmap
 [dlp]: but in the program likely crossing the line ;] theres a middleground option too, for some overcommit
 chotaz: i'd make my swap at elast half with that much memory
 chotaz: that way a failed hibernate is less likely to sneak up on you
 (which SUCKS, unless you like a hot bag & really hot laptop)
 KNUBBIG: /window level -joins -parts
 [dlp]: hybrid suspend wakes up the laptop for a hibernate after a while, or when the battery gets to 3%
 which is why, practically speaking; i use hibernate a lot
 JaymesKeller: you probably have to install dmraid, rebuild your ramfs & reboot
 mordof: is grub doing it or is it a busybox prompt?
 [dlp]: i rely on keeping my work around heavily, like months of suspends & a few hibernates
 mordof: if it doesn't say busybox don't worry about it
 commodore64th: compiz with the unity plugin
 nutsfornatty / acicula: the _window manager_ is compiz
 Ziber: not really, the workspaces are for allmonitors
 Ziber: you can probably get by with sticking some apps in all workspaces though
 [dlp]: heres one of those special cases thatneed intervention, you want to help him? :D
 acicula: ping, help _stev_
 thebigroflz: do you have ubuntu log you in without a password? if you do, it won't unlock the keyring for you automatically, and you'll get the joy of unlocking it for just about every access
 thebigroflz: but in this case in particular you can bypass the problem by setting "Available for all users" in the connection properties, it will make it a system connection and store the password somewhere else, and as a bonus it'll come up way before you log in :]
 nowherefast: um, don't tell people to install wicd
 nowherefast: what wifi chip do you have? it sounds like you've gotten some awesomely bad advice
 nowherefast: no reason to keep repeating it, if theres a problem with networkmanager it should be fixed
 nowherefast: are you using natty?
 nowherefast: what problems are you having with the "current" drivers
 shmoolikipod: #ubuntu-offtopic
 shmoolikipod: this is a help channel
 nowherefast: well it's a very windowsy thing to suggest to remove/reinstall drivers; the often have nothing to do with it
 WhiteD: never force anything you don't know how to fix manually
 shmoolikipod: pick the classic session on the login screen
 JaymesKeller: if you scan manually with dmraid does it find the volumes?
 WhiteD: why would that stop it, is it defective?
 JaymesKeller: "man dmraid" or dmraid --help in a terminal
 nowherefast: well, remove all the changes you made trying to solve the problem for one
 JaymesKeller: what controller?
 shmoolikipod: click on your name first, it's at the bottom
 JaymesKeller: then it is not hardware
 nowherefast: how sure are you that it is?
 WhiteD: there are logs generated during the install, you could look at those
 WhiteD: open a terminal then look in /var/log/dist-upgrade/
 WhiteD: err nevermind that
 WhiteD: for installs theres a different location & i don't remember it offhand
 nowherefast: well trying wicd instead of networkmanager doesn't tell you anything
 nowherefast: wicd gets less eyes, i trust it a lot less than n-m
 nowherefast: try and connect with n-m, then grep -i networkman /var/log/syslog
 nowherefast: it's very noisy about what it does, if you can't figure it out paste the output to a pastebin
 cmykify: try running something like htop in a terminal, it shows more information
 nowherefast: indeed, you know those cards have problems with wmm/qos/power saving and some other things, do you have them enabled on your router?
 FloatingGoat: ayatana?
 chotaz: use the classic desktop session, pick it on the login screen
 nowherefast: post the output to a pastebin please
 chotaz: not if you installed it, theres a lot more than unity in play, just use the classic session
 WhiteD: are you running apt-get or synaptic, or aptitude or anything at the same time?
 entity: mount understands UUID=<uuid> for the volume name, no need to use that path
 WhiteD: ok 1 sec, theres a quick way to check
 WhiteD: fuser -v /var/lib/dpkg/lock
 nowherefast: as a rule i don't trouble myself with forums, but i'll make an exception this time; please use paste.ubuntu.com in the future
 cmykify: it says at the top where its's being used
 cmykify: be sure to run it w/ "sudo htop" as by default it only shows your usere & no kernel threads
 chotaz: choose the user, then look at the bottom
 erik333: and netbooks, they outsell notebooks, and notebooks desktops
 WhiteD: ok then that message is wrong or not the real error
 cmykify: the cpu usage bar at the top is one solid color?
 WhiteD: that is very old information, even if it was correct at the time, be careful
 nowherefast: you haven't identified a problem yet, just a symptom
 cmykify: because it shows 4 types of information, irqs and stuff
 WhiteD: good luck with kde guys D:
 nowherefast: have you tried the backports?
 nowherefast: well with the proper package name, but yes
 nowherefast: are you sure it's any wifi and not one particular router?
 erik333: there is no panel in unity
 cmykify: it is not displaying as i expected, if it were it would show whats doing it
 nowherefast: but your eee doesn't have an intel wifi chip, theres another problem
 erik333: yea, it's only superficially similar
 nowherefast: so changing your drivers would do what exactly?
 nowherefast: things to check: if its wireless g/n, make sure b interop is on even if you're not using b, disable wmm, disable wireless power savings
 nowherefast: there aren't different drivers practically speaking, there is one, and less good options, like madwifi, vendor drivers or ndiswrapper
 nowherefast: separate concern, and the mainline one will be fixed some day
 nowherefast: you need to open your routers management pages, it has loads of options
 kaiyin: yes, but not generally; purging ppa's is nearly a must for upgrades
 nowherefast: any change?
 kaiyin: unfortunately it's down to what you don't know with ppas :\
 nowherefast: lsmod
 kaiyin: ppa-purge ppa:that/youadded0itwith
 conical: enable remote assistance
 Mikaze: if that was it, why bother with ubuntu?
 nowherefast: it might use the same name, but it wont be the same driver
 WhiteD: ahhh, good deal
 kaiyin: look in /etc/apt/sources.list.d for the ppa entries, just get their names don't delete them; ppa-puge does downgrades & it needs them there
 nowherefast: of course, but it's not just the driver; those chips are a pain too
 nowherefast: they won't work in windows unless you disable the thruoghput boosting thing for routers made in the last 6 years or so either, it's great
 nowherefast: what router do you have?
 Spaz_Dynamic: get skype from the partner repo & it'll get upgrades automatically
 SinnerNyx: /etc/issue?
 SinnerNyx: grep /etc for bits that you already see on logon :]
 nowherefast: if you wanted to do that, but what are you going to do for your netbook? you need to find out what external problems there can be
 turning off all optional features of the router is a good start
 pfifo: generally no
 pfifo: but with php caching things or fastcgi it can get weird
 pfifo: if you're using the threaded mpm it might need a restart, i haven't messed with the new (as of 4 years ago lul) stuff in apache 2
 pfifo: the package likely modified php's configuration and if it's never reloaded during its normal lifecycle you might need to force it
 nowherefast: best ratings? i have two atheros devices and the mac80211 drivers are great
 nowherefast: if the problem is know it will end up in module backports as soon as it's available, picking an alternative only picks the worst possible compromise
 nowherefast: if you want me to offer anything else i'll need to know something about the router
 likki: windows
 likki: be sure to report a bug if you find one
 conical: if you didn't already install ssh or some other remote access, you don't
 likki: it's a monoculture, what do you expect there to be a bunch of independent windows implementations so you can pick which one sucks the least? what is your actual problem
 they don't have enough engineers to fix sound problems and stuff; that's just reality, give them money or code if you need to
 conical: well you normally see a greeter, but since you're in with ssh, you need to start an x session manually, but even then that's probably not what you want, what are you trying to do?
 a _repeater_, i see
 nowherefast: well take the repeater out of the equation, can you reach the router?
 conical: go on
 nowherefast: i mean can your devices reasonably speak to it over wifi
 SinnerNyx: motd is generated from other files, let me look real quick from where
 SinnerNyx: dig /etc/update-motd.d/
 Soothsayer: it can be set up any time, what do you want to put on it?
 SinnerNyx: the release name isn't part of the file
 SinnerNyx: no waste :]
 freeman_: look in ccsm for the options of the unity plugin, last time looked you could pick the edge and whether it autohid
 LAcan: are you using backtrack?
 kaiyin: rdiff-backup?
 kaiyin: you might look at duplicity / deja-dup (a ui for the former), it's great
 freeman_: compizconfig-settings-manager, it lets you edit the compiz settings, one of the plugins happens to be unity
 kaiyin: i highly recommend duplicity even, if you're looking at using rdiff-backup; unless having the last available version available with its original name is a hard requirement
 Hello71: they are like all the other packages
 OchoZero9: if you have a touchscreen you don't need a special version
 OchoZero9: oh kubuntu, then you probably want ubuntu-desktop and to log in with the main session
 freeman_: yep, the command is called ccsm, in the package compizconfig-settings-manager
 kaiyin: insanely much faster
 kaiyin: plus doing baackups every hour is fast enough to do it every hour :D
 Soothsayer: keeping data safe takes a lot more than just raid-n, i'm not really comfortable offering advice
 Soothsayer: i will say though, raid is useless without backups, so if you think it will help you avoid them, that's a common mistake
 freeman_: the big purple logo with Unity on it, that's the unity plugin
 soreau: click on the top left then type it in
 soreau: oh yea
 soreau: you can click the power button too, it offers a system settings entry
 freeman_: no idea there, i don't use unity
 a7ndrew: then ready for what release?
 a7ndrew: the netbook version had most of the ideas for unity already in it and used, except it as hacks with maximus and stuff
 a7ndrew: the unity plugin for compiz does almost all the same stuff but it's not a hack
 a7ndrew: you might as well be the only one using multiple monitors, because a lot of people don't on netbooks
 a7ndrew: also testing versions have been available for a long time, you should have spoke up then
 a7ndrew: netbooks outsell notebooks outsell desktops
 katsrc: the edid information for your monitor is incorrect or unavailable, you'll have to add modes manually with xrandr
 gogeta: shrug, people are buying netbooks faster
 a7ndrew: so use the classic session & what you're familiar with
 SinnerNyx: great
 SinnerNyx: props for figuring out the .d thing, most people don't even look around
 gogeta: thats most of what i see at the schools :D
 gogeta: but still, large target, and cheaper machines with smaller screens are becoming more prevalent
 gogeta: natty has a first class omap4 target this time around
 soreau: are you using metacity? long story short, the panel applet with the application/places/system menu on it does that
 conical: to do what you want to do you need to use xvnc
 soreau: #ubuntu-offtopic
 a7ndrew: there are no panels in unity, just something that looks like one
 Guest50068: firefox does its  own ui
 Guest50068: clearlooks will apply to buttons and some things, but not overall
 Spaz_Dynamic: because it extracts all of the package information to do an atomic application of the packages
 Spaz_Dynamic: it's faster, and it needs all the packages to apply to do it
 Guest50068: not in a manner that will probably get you what you want :\
 Spaz_Dynamic: done in one go, or not done at all
 Spaz_Dynamic: installing 100 packages one a ta  time is different than installing them in one step
 Guest50068: that'd be something your window decorator needs to be told to do; either from compiz or if it's metacity, in it's gconf settings
 Slimcea_boy: only the alternate
 Slimcea_boy: the livecd is cloned to the systen with a regular livecd, the alternate has packages on it
 MarcN1: what wifi hw?
 andrew__: it changes the release name and switches to that releases package versions
 MarcN1: ah, you could try installing bcmwl-kernel-source, it's the proprietary driver, but i've had luck with it on my netbook (namely it doesn't drop connections in a manner that would seem to suggest the wifi chipset is overheating)
 MarcN1: was that an upgrade or a new install? if the former it might like a firmware update
 PovAddict: gnome is 99.99% of what makes ubuntu go
 PovAddict: unity is 0.001%, and it's a plugin for an alternate window manager, compiz
 MK``: the shell is still separate, but it does meld a few things; it's just a plugin for compiz
 OchoZero9: why would that be?
 PovAddict: no they weren't (modifying)
 PovAddict: in fact you can still go look at the patches ubuntu maintains outside of gnome and that they couldn't get upstream
 MarcN1: dunno, chances are it's the bios or something; crashing problems are really lame
 MarcN1: really lame that they crash for one, but also generally really lame as to the root cause
 Herbs: linux is a kernel, what you think of the shell is probably a getty on one of the virtual terminals
 OchoZero9: afaik there are no special steps, if unity 3d doesn't run on your device you can always try unity2d
 gogeta: what?
 gogeta: you know gnome is a huge collection of software, the window manager and nautilus are small but important constituent parts
 gogeta: that's your opinion, and it doesn't bear repeating; go talk to them about how you think you can improve them
 MarcN1: ah, ath9k? i have an ath5k too and it works great
 gogeta: why do you need to? do you even know what the terms you're using are?
 gogeta: gnome3 is a deprecation and migration effort largely centered around gtk and the libraries nearly always used alongside it
 gogeta: there is also gnome-shell
 gogeta: no they didn't
 nowherefast: dunno if that's weird, i do know there was a firmware transition in that timeframe
 soreau: it is offtopic, we support it, we don't care what you think about it
 gogeta: you don't know what you are talking about, at all
 gogeta: gtk is a library software uses, it's not going anywhere
 gogeta: i know that, you are making statements and i am reading them
 soreau: "unity sucks" is not a support question
 gogeta: yea just like everyone did last time, quality matters
 ChronicSyncope: isn't that awesome, i've had a hell of a time with compiz .9 too
 gogeta: you are thinking of a past that didn't exist
 gogeta: do you remember qpl?
 gogeta: and you remember how it was a joke that e17 was never finished
 ChronicSyncope: it should have already, but eh, you could try alt+f2 and typing in compiz --replace
 gogeta: good thing it's not a poll huh
 soreau: 18:30 < soreau> What a constricting piece of garbage unity is
 soreau: #ubuntu-offtopic is for those statements if you would like to keep making them, particularly the adjective is useless to anyone in here
 extraclassic: lawl
 gogeta: oh you've shown your cards then, you really do not know anything and merely believe you're above the fray
 soreau: i quoted you, i trust that you know what an adjective is
 soreau: i am not, what can i do to help you with a constricting piece of garbage? i think there's not much i can do! if you had forme dit as a question i could have said something
 soreau: you thanked me last time i answered a question you actually asked
 atpa8a: can you rephrase that in the form of a question
 atpa8a: which one is it? you probably need to install firmware
 atpa8a: in 11.04 you can too, but you should try the included drivers
 spungo: they are not
 spungo: if they are they will not be here in that capacity
 atpa8a: well the kernel has drivers, it needs the firmware; but theres also bcmwl-kernel-source which is the proprietary driver, i thought you were talking about the latter, but then you mentioned fwcutter
 atpa8a: ok, well in the fwcutter package theres a script that will install it for you
 atpa8a: dpkg -L b43-fwcutter will list the files installed & the script's name will be in there
 MarcN1: i had a freeze problem with mine too; it would prevent it from booting though, ssb/b43 had a problem that when they were loaded it'd succeed without a freeze less than half the time, that' was awesome
 MarcN1: but i got it fixed by talkingwith the developer :]
 MarcN1: oh that's what you posted, thanks for filing a bug
 MarcN1: can you try installing linux-backports-modules-net-natty-generic and see if it still freezes after a reboot?
 MarcN1: that's one of the first thing someone will ask you to try
 Soothsayer: yep, i do
 Soothsayer: i also tried to ask you before you left, what crashes?
 Soothsayer: you said you were doing raid for robustitigitation in face of crashes, what crashes?
 Soothsayer: ah
 Soothsayer: for each disk you increase your odds of disk failure :D
 spungo: you shouldn't have to enable anyhting it should just work
 spungo: try installing powertop and running it for a while, it might be able to tell you what's keeping it from clocking down; and will tell you what states it's been in and for how long
 rileyp: he should, sandybridge and ironlake are supported by the drivers ...
 spungo: it might at any given time; that's not an appropriate way to check it
 Soothsayer: good idea
 Soothsayer: it makes you think about it too; it's a handy device
 zapradical: i don't know about any themes, but there are a handful of appearances that come with it that you can pick from in the options
 zapradical: from the mainui, edit -> preferences -> themes tab
 SuBmUnDo: don't spam the channel please, with away messages or url's
 ChronicSyncope: ccsm, enable the wobbly plugin
 gogeta: arand knows a lot about using btrfs, and the different filesystems generally aren't comparable on those terms; you should just listen to him
 ChronicSyncope: you should be using the opengl plugin, i really don't like how they split that in .9
 arand: noted
 ChronicSyncope: just enabling it should be enough, if your video card can actually manage
 celeryman: nobody has seen your problem, most likely; i know i havent, and i use shotwell
 ChronicSyncope: yea but it might not with nouveau; so you'd additionally need to try the proprietary driver
 HyperSh0ck: the mime type for folders got changed to open with gedit, if you right click on a folder you can have it open with nautilus again
 ChronicSyncope: dunno what to say
 ChronicSyncope: then it's probably using nouveau; i don't know how to make it "in use"
 xsinick: #ubuntu-offtopic, this is a support channel
 xsinick: there were many months of prereleases where you could have provided feedback
 (but still not here, t his is a support channel)
 ChronicSyncope: the open source 3rd party nvidia driver
 ChronicSyncope: it's finally shipping in natty, it can do quite a bit :]
 xsinick: there isn't one, it's not a panel; it just looks like one
 xsinick: you need a panel if you want that, don't use unity; pick the classic session on othe login screen
 ChronicSyncope: paste the output of glxinfo to a pastebin (run it in a terminal)
 Surlent777: it's not really dumped, it was just never added; it's a new implementation
 ChronicSyncope: ehhh i don't care, but a lot of people do talking about cracked software and stuff
 ChronicSyncope: right, people don't understand the distinction generally; just a heads up
 ChronicSyncope: i know
 ChronicSyncope: that's advice from other users, upstream would prefer bugs that keep copy protectionf rom not working being fixed
 mordof: look at the vendor string, it should signal rather clearly if it's the proprietary or nouveau driver
 spungo: OK, did you do anything to disable acpi?
 Herbs: that is offtopic
 Herbs: this is a support channel
 spungo: post the output of dmesg to a pastebin
 OchoZero9: i don't know what to say
 OchoZero9: it should come back itself, but alt+f2 and run compiz --replace
 Herbs: "i don't use, but isn't it buggy"
 Herbs: that's not a fact, and shouldn't be presented as such, that is your apparently not personally informed opinion
 mordof: if it says nvidia corporation it's the proprietary driver
 ChronicSyncope: that was gone a while ago iirc
 Herbs: please, if you don't have any questions or need any help, don't speak; there are lots of people talking
 Herbs: one need not ask; this is a help channel, and we all know it
 Herbs: please, if you don't have any questions or need any help, don't speak; there are lots of people talking
 spungo: hmm, i dunno, everything that'd make it work is there; i don't personally pay attention to the eee stuff, but eee_laptop might have changed between then and now, i'd look there first
 Herbs: this is a help channel, it's not a free speech thing, what you are doing right now is completely antithetical to what the channel is, and you don't even suggest that you are here to get support for a problem you are having; that annoys people
 spungo: it surely is interesting :]
 xsinick: you probably can, just turn on the unity plugin in ccsm, and use compiz as your wm, it's not designed to work like that, but it might be OK
 xsinick: or it might not, if the unity plugin draws the boxes that are in the middle, then you can't just get the bar
 Herbs: do you need help? i simply asked you to stop speaking if you don't need help, there are already a lot of people talking
 Herbs: is that a question?
 fezzik02: you're getting a black screen, right?
 lestat__: do you need help?
 xsinick: most people are complaining about cosmetic issues; they're not trying to convince you to switch or anything
 xsinick: it's just simpler and more forward looking, with tablets and netbooks
 fezzik02: boot how?
 ChronicSyncope: no, you can still use it as your window manager
 dasy2k1: i don't recall that entry ever, what kernel were you running?
 fezzik02: so after an install?
 xsinick: fwiw it doesn't suit me without a proper panel, the panel is make or break for me
 dasy2k1: hmmmm
 dasy2k1: ah the governor options
 dasy2k1: theres one for each cpu, and /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice_load
 dasy2k1: find | grep ftw
 xsinick: in old versions using compiz or not using compiz?
 xsinick: nvidia dirvers have some awful gotchas with multiple outputs, and they don't do xrandr 1.2+
 ChronicSyncope: i had lots of compiz crashes when i was trying to set up my old settings, i don't think they tested much more than what unity would use
 CrouchingTiger: we don't support a lot of variants like backtrack here
 afroman: the best way is to melt it
 afroman: and as been mentioned, dban; but there are also secure erase commands oyu can give most newer drives
 afroman: then the drive firmware erases it
 dasy2k1: the molecules don't move :D their magnetic domains do
 Herbs: no need for ad hominem or calling people names, if you have a question ask it; or please be quiet, or take your outbursts to #ubuntu-offtopic
 cylob: how did you install it?
 Herbs: i didn't even say what she said; and it doesn't matter
 cylob: you might be interested in googleearth-package, it will make a .deb for you, it's cleaner to install and remove that way; also it will depend on, and thus install fonts it depends on
 cylob: yea, it's also the package name if you just want to apt-get install it
 cylob: it contains make-googleearth-package, which you run to make the .deb for you
 KM0201: you know about the classic session right?
 Herbs: do you have a question, please take your outbursts elsewhere
 ncg: nvidia or ati card?
 KM0201: the panel and stuff will stay around for a long time, even with gnome-shell
 KM0201: i hesitate to say indefinitely but i can't see some developers leave it behind
 anonemoose: i'm not sure what part would "make" it incompatible, it tries very hard to make images/disks that will play in dvd players; what problem are you having?
 bittyx-laptop: iirc you can assign shortcuts to each ime in the options
 anonemoose: ahh, well in that case make brasero burn to an .iso image file; then burn that to the disk
 anonemoose: then you can skip the huge transcoding task in the middle if you have to try again
 bittyx-laptop: ah i just looked, just enable/disable and next/previous
 bittyx-laptop: maybe something other than ibus can do bindings like you want
 !resetpanels | soreau
 bittyx-laptop: i know the other one can do it, i can't even remember the name at the moment though, i've been using them through ibus for so long
 soreau: your session manager should have restarted them
 soreau: if you've got some brain death going on there i don't know what to tell you
 soreau: i meant with whatever session manager, or lack thereof that you are running
 soreau: what session manager are you running? it should have restarted the panel
 thien: directory
 soreau: i do not know why your panel didn't restart then, not without that information, i'm sorry it didn't
 !ot | soreau
 Nostromo: wiped and installed natty again?
 Nostromo: that's unfortunately a common problem, intel video right?
 soreau: don't badger people
 Nostromo: ok, you can try installing xorg-edgers and running the kernel they package, it has updated driver components
 Nostromo: but it might not, and you'll need to file a bug; i've told 3 people to file today so it should be getting lots of attention :]
 kyle___: yes but you won't tell us what it is!
 Nostromo: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa in a terminal
 Nostromo: then apt-get update, apt-get upgrade
 Nostromo: it might not fix it
 Nostromo: and in any case if it worked, it would just be something to report with the bug, because the fix needs to get from the updated drivers to the version included in ubuntu
 soreau: it's part of a hueg combo applet
 Herbs: it contains updated drivers, it is semi official in ubuntu, they have a bleeding edge and stable driver update ppa; and all the people rolling packages in it are ubuntu developers
 soreau: if you don't want the big one add the ones the big ones include
 multipass: gnome is still there, it's 99.99% of what ubuntu is, unity is 0.001%, a plugin for a window manager, compiz; and you can pick the classic session from the login screen
 Herbs: that elaboration was for you, i didn't need to justify suggesting it
 multipass: versions for review had been available for a very long time before the release; any particular reason why you are reporting your issues with the decisions made now, and on a help channel?
 Herbs: sure why not, it's not as if ppa's aren't signed by the uploader like any other pakcage
 multipass: that's unfortunate, now that natty has shipped they're working on oneiric though; if you want to try and get your input taken as part of it's development, now's the time to start doing it :D
 stbain1: generally you have to have a lot of user changes for it to break; user changes you should undo before you upgrade, next time come around i'll tell you how to fix it, rather than just telling people to be careful since you had a bad experience
 izinucs: the next release code name
 Spaz_Dynamic: openjdk
 stbain1: i'll take your word for it; like i said, next time, i don't know the circumstances for when it broke for you
 multipass: you probably just want to use the classic session instead of unity then, pick it on the login screen
 superproxy: a long time, depends on the computer & internet connection; mine took like 2 hours but i had lots of packages installed
 superproxy: oh installation, nevermind me, that was much faster
 GI_Jack: install bootchart and see; i didn't notice any change, if anything it's slightly faster
 ACameron: launchpad.net
 freeman_: rar is nonfree, you need to enable the universe repos; i don't know if software-center does that, or looks there
 mordof: only if you enable the extra repos
 i've typed a small novel in here today, gonna go do something else
 Chilaquiles: that would be nice :D i doubt spacebar and stuff would work the same, i like th emulticolumn mode
 GI_Jack: #ubuntu-offtopic, if you have a help question please ask
 GI_Jack: does it? what sata controller? (btw, this would be udev's rules scripts and possibly kernel changes, only coincidentally ubuntu changes because it includes both)
 GI_Jack: and gtk3 is just deprecation and cleanup of things, and they're rolling some libraries that were almost always used together into gtk where appropriate; otherwise it is unremarkable, same thing happened with gtk2
 fruitwerks-web: go :]
 Wickedspawn: OSS4 is a junk, that's why
 Wickedspawn: (i lie, that's probably not why, but you'd rather fix what works right and is free)
 GI_Jack: if you find out let me know, it was clunky when first installed but it got better much faster
 GI_Jack: it's overlay-scrollbar, i don't think you can remove the package, but there's a conf file you can turn it off or something i'm sure
 Wickedspawn: i hesitate to say you are full of crap, but you are certainly deluding yourself; and i bet you haven't even objectively measured, you just think your statement is well supported
 pomke: you'll have to talk to whoever supports those packages, ubuntu proper doesn't
 Wickedspawn: did you measure a great improvement? you are making a statement common to fans of OSS(4) and it's never supported by more than a gut feeling, there are ways to measure things however
 Wickedspawn: it's interesting you went out of your way to mention oss3 too, very interesting
 kellnola: make something up! you saw the early release names right? they weren't always alphabetical, it was just a fun thing to do
 Wickedspawn: since you've stated you merely like it, i apologize, as long as it's not presented as fact
 Wickedspawn: but it is definitely contraindicated, if there is a problem with alsa or one of the drivers it will need to be fixed anyways; people in general aren't going to switch over to oss4 even assuming it was bug free and always better than alsa
 Wickedspawn: alsa is in tree and supported by free software developers interested in fixing bugs they know about, and quite quickly i might add
 Wickedspawn: it's really no different though, you were on your own before when you used it, now you're just a little bit more on your own
 fruitwerks-web: can you elaborate?
 fruitwerks-web: do you mean nfs or cifs or something, people have been giving you suggestions for samba
 stbain1: you are the second person today having trouble with the 4311, did it freeze your computer when you weren't using the sta driver?
 kellnola: well he said nfs, which is a real thing; i didn't see him mention anything else
 kellnola: i asked him to elaborate, i could have probably told him what it wasD:
 lumbert: yes it is
 stbain1: after you installed natty but before you installed sta?
 stbain1: oh i thought you were having a problem with your wifi, that's while you're trying to install then, no?
 stbain1: you need firmware if you are using the driver that comes with linux, there is a script in the b43-fwcutter package that does that for you; or you can try installing bcmwl-kernel-source, which is the vendor driver
 teddyroosebelt: it still works for me
 greylurk: you have too many primary partitions on your drive
 stbain1: ok, i never used thata; and it works for me, dunno what to say
 stbain1: dmesg should say if the driver is finding its firmware
 teddyroosebelt: luck is a figment of peoples imagination and want for lovely coincidence
 audhi: no clue, i just hit customize in the appearance applet
 xsinick: do you even use empathy?
 it sure does
 i was getting to what Jordan_U said already ...
 xsinick: what point in the video are you talking about?
 xsinick: or rather what video are you talking about at all, i don't see any video on the front page
 RexAlters: well ubuntu doesn't do it, but there are some programs that you can install on ubuntu that does; like musicbrainz picard
 xsinick: thank you
 Macer: well how do you know nfs is down? the kernel tries its best to get it to act like a regular filesystem, and that means possibly waiting a very long time if the server isn't reachable
 Macer: you still can't really ask "is nfs up?" that's the basic question you need in order to find some software that can do what you want if it's there or not there
 stbain1: raw??? never use ndiswrapper if you can help it; argh
 Macer: it's possible, but you have to decide what it would be, you probably want to copy/cache/sync files from nfs before log on, not try and use nfs and fallback
 Macer: no, it's not a simple question, as there is no fallback mechanism and you can't check if nfs is up or not
 stbain1: bcmwl-kernel-source works for me
 Macer: what happens when nfs comes back when you're using the local directory? what happens when it goes away when you are logged on?
 Macer: what you really want to do is cache offline; and lots of people have done that
 Macer: well you can buffet that with pam login/log out scripts that update the cache too, or not even have periodic syncs
 Macer: there are fuse filesystems that can do caching for you, but they likely wouldn't be enough for your circumstance
 Macer: so you want them to be able to log in but not have any of their information or store any changes they make back at the real server?
 Macer: you could just log them on with a guest session if nfs isn't available
 xsinick: family channel ...
 Macer: the . files in the home directories can be arbitrarily large; sounds like the problem you actually want to solve is ill defined
 Macer: in any situation i've seen, if the files aren't available then work can't be done anyways, so they just aren't allowed to log in, you want some sort of middle ground that still allows them to log in?
 Macer: once there are local changes what will you do? if nfs was down for 6 hours the changes might be against files from 6 hours or earlier ago, if they're applied to current files they'd have a nonlinear history that would possibly cause data loss that people would not realize
 Macer: then you should probably find a way for nfs never to be down :O
 tanath: what's that?
 tanath: i can try and fill you in if you can give me some things
 Macer: then have them connect using a guest account, it is easy to do that even
 Macer: guest accounts create temporary directories & people log in, their changes are obliterated when they log out
 Macer: there are also larger unfixable problems, like the nonlinear file history
 tanath: ah; allow me to allay those fears, even with gnome-shell nautilus and the panel will still be available, as they are now with unity
 Macer: not if you modified a file from 6 hours ago, but you save it over one that has been changed outside of the cached copy
 Macer: the problem is offering older copies to the client
 Jordan_U: oh he was talking about the gnome webpage D:
 jeeze that's annoying, and why do they have to publish videos for that stuff? are they trying to be mozilla without actually doing anything interesting?
 tanath: well, that's something else; and you don't have to worry about it, you can just use the classic session
 tanath: theres not a lot of room for that, they're designing an experience
 nmvictor: you can change your password to match your keyring password, or vice versa
 fedora does have a lot of upstream oomph
 but i'd hate to dip outside of the repos for something as trivial as ffmpeg or stuff that uses it
 Cr3al: the thing at the top with unity is not a panel
 Cr3al: it looks sort of like it,  but the panels are gone; if you want them then you probably also want the classic session, which you can pick from the login screen
 sta11: did you hear that from someone with your exact machine, and did he tell you all the circumstances that made it slower? if not, you weren't told much, and should just see for yourself
 Varth: chrome draws its own decorations, t heres not much you can do about it
 jiltdil: install the gui for ufw
 jiltdil: it only does simple block and allow rules, but you can add custom rules to be applied with them (man ufw-framework)
 jbeatty: do you need help? you might try #ubuntu-offtopic otherwise, this is a help channel
 jbeatty: #ubuntu-offtopic
 Neo_: well, you should have looked at your other options before building it yourself; for example, the xorg-edgers ppa already builds it almost daily, and it installs it in the right place / works; so if you can clean up the mess, try the ppa
 Neo_: ehh, just use the ppa
 Neo_: theres another ppa they run that just has stable driver updates in it as well
 Neo_: then you add the sources and use package pinning; but it is still somethingn you don't want to do, there were 2 xorg abi updates that natty rolled in iirc
 Neo_: unfortunately due to changes in natty the ppa stopped doing daily builds for maverick and older some time ago; otherwise you could just use it for updated drivers for mav as well
 vivid: there's a ppa, but it's not really supported here
 vivid: we? ubuntu still ships gnome2, if you want it use the classic session; newer versions will include gnome3 after it's had some time to breathe, it was only just released
 vivid: it was not
 tripelb: filesystems already store everything all over the disk; theres really no distinction between filesystems in that regard, you're probably thinking of extents which are new in 4
 vivid: i said gnome3
 vivid: gnome-shell 2.31 was from 2010, and was a development release
 vivid: gnome-shell might be the distinctive feature of gnome3 _now_, but that doesn't mean it was then
 RyanCM: open software properties and have it display updates that aren't lts releases
 vivid: because its dependencies aren't, gnome3 is not; gnome-shell 2.31 ran largely on top of gtk2 and all that stuff, for the developer previews
 RyanCM: ah well you should have said that :] most people would interpret your original question as the button you're expecting not being present
 RyanCM: not really; it sounds like a generic failure message that is clobbering the real message
 engammalsko: pick the classic session on the login screen
 _Mr_Proper_: that was just to switch the wm to compiz or run ccsm, you can do that yourself too :] they have tests for compiz now, i think it just automatically runs if it can, then you would need to edit the settings with ccsm
 RyanCM: yes, but i haven't used it
 TheRedOctober: no, they cannot share firefox profiles, you can create multiple ones, but it sounds like you have a problem you're trying to brute force
 RyanCM: there are logs in /var/log/dist-upgrade you could look at, i'm not sure if they'd have been written to by the time you get the message you are getting, but it's worth a look
 RyanCM: then you'll need to look in /tmp, if logs still aren't there, then your machine isn't able to even fetch the upgrader
 rye: and if that's the case, you don't have an internet connection for all intents and purposes ... cuz you can't get the file from ubuntu's servers for the upgrade :D you could try changing your mirrors, i'm not sure where it gets the upgrader bundle
 mello: it's probably clementine, not the filesystem, though you could rule out the filesystem by copying all of them to another filesystem and trying the same thing, but it's not the filesystem
 mello: did you remove all songs from rhythmbox to see if they all loaded when you readded them?
 mello: rhythmbox keeps track of songs that have been added and just checks if they're still there; which is different from loading them all originally, it may have worked at one point in the past & rhythmbox may have been able to load all of them, then the disk became damaged
 mello: if you want a clean test run rhythmbox with --dry-run or --rhythmdb-file <newdb> so it wont' use the original database of song information
 MnCC: pick the classic session from the login screen
 MnCC: at the bottom, after you click on your name
 JoeCoolDesk: if you don't have a question or need help, #ubuntu-offtopic
 JoeCoolDesk: did you use lvm for / or have some other ad-hoc setup?
 JoeCoolDesk: what is /?
 JoeCoolDesk: dual booting shouldn't matter or anything, how your filesystem is assembled might have been would be
 JoeCoolDesk: i didn't say it was, but if you want to be beligerent i've got other things to do
 Kyubey: pulseaudio uses alsa to output sound, it's not an alternative
 Kyubey: open the volume control and go to the hardware tab, do you see any devices?
 Kyubey: that's the first step, find out how to do it so your sound can be fixed
 Kyubey: ok, are you using kubuntu?
 Kyubey: ok, open a terminal and run fuser -v /dev/snd/* paste teh output if there is any to paste.ubuntu.com
 ActionParsnip: i got this one, and that'd be 100% useless in this case, have to start at the top, pulse is failing to start or blocked on opening the devices
 Kyubey: ok, don't worry about pasting the rest, you have flash player interfering with pulse
 Kyubey: yeah, so close whatever is using it, pulse goes to sleep by itself after a while and something can open the device directly under it
 Kyubey: well, i'd stop using nspluginwrapper, but that doesn't really have anything to do with it; just kill flash and pulse will do everything itself
 phibxr: it's not going to be "supported" for a while, it's oneiric
 Kyubey: you can, but like i said; pulse goes to sleep when theres nothing to do, and that means a bad app can open and hog the device under it
 Kyubey: you should use the native 64bit plugin, it's less problematic
 engammalsko: sounds like you need to enable the window decorator plugin in compiz
 engammalsko: it's an option like any other in ccsm; can you actually move windows and switch their order at the moment? compiz could have crashed too
 engammalsko: "effects"
 phibxr: you can't disable the decorator separately with metacity
 engammalsko: could be
 syn3rgy: in unity the top bar is not really a panel, it just looks like it; if you want the panel pick the classic session on the login screen, after you click on your username
 syn3rgy: not really; it's just different, i wouldn't try to look for things i'd just try and use it as it was intended, as close as you can like a new user
 ActionParsnip: things are opening the sound device under pulseaudio
 trae: if you don't need help, #ubuntu-offtopic
 trae: there was a long long long review period before the release
 engammalsko: moving windows is another compiz plugin
 FunnyLookinHat: you'll find that any time that question is asked it will always put something like unity off, into perpetuity
 tase: with md5sum, compare it to the version on the website; or use the "check disk for errors" entry on the initial boot menu
 tase: the thing that asks for your language? you might need to press a key to display it
 alaruz: it should work with both, but the changes would be mutually exclusive, it would get the authentication/wifi information only from one however
 Dominater: install ccsm and edit the settings for the Unity plugin in it
 Kyubey: i told you what the problem is
 Kyubey: what part of the answer did you not like?
 tase: there should be a message just after the cd boots that offers to select a language, try, install, or test the disk
 ActionParsnip: that's not the best advice to give without also telling them to report a bug if it does work, if they roll with it and don't report a bug it might never be fixed
 Kyubey: flash is the problem, it's opened the sound device under pulse
 Kyubey: kill flash and pulse will start, but you'll probably run into the problem again in the future
 Kyubey: i've used the native plugin and have not had that problem in a very very long time, and nspluginwrapper is garbage
 Kyubey: ok, then repaste the output of fuser -v /dev/snd/*
 alaruz: they can and should be able to add it for themselves, since the nm-applet they run provides all the information for networkmanager to do the work
 Kyubey: ok you have yet another problem with a browser plugin opening the device under pulseaudio
 Kyubey: keep killing it until it says pulseaudio in the output of fuser -v /dev/snd/*
 mello: are they all mp3 or are there wma, ogg, flac and stuff all in there
 Kyubey: ok then try opening th emixer
 raylee_: linux is an important but small part of what people would call an "OS"
 alaruz: that's probably right, it's one device; it cant' really be shared, but i dno't know how it decides which gets the wheel
 Kyubey: ok open a terminal and run pulseaudio -k && pulseaudio
 alaruz: i'd presume that the current foreground user would get access, it might be a bug if that isn't the case
 Soothsayer: it's faster in some circumstances, theres no comppsite number and it's also slower in some circumstances
 Kyubey: well there's your problem, pulse is refusing to start because you don't own your home directory, or it's permissions are too lax
 Kyubey: are you running it as root?
 it's a user level service
 it'll be a fun day when that does something really bad
 Kyubey: then it started normally?
 Rockj: you probably wan't the classic session then, pick it on the login screen after clicking on your name
 Kyubey: pulseaudio -k && pulseaudio tries to kill it, then run it again
 Kyubey: that is fine, forget it, just run pulseaudio -vvv and see what it isays
 Rockj: yea, ubuntu still is 99.99% gnome, unity is a plugin for compiz which is an alternative window manager
 Soothsayer: it doesn't require a separate partition, but you should use one if you can
 Soothsayer: so you can hibernate to it
 haroon: install the firmware with b43-fwcutter or use bcmwl-kernel-source
 Soothsayer: sure, i did 6 because i have a lot of stuff that lives on swap most of the time
 Rockj: well, there was a design and they fleshed it out, and a review period that was long and before the rerlease so theres not much to say about it now :\ they might bin it if it's no good ;]
 Kyubey: ok pulse is running now
 Kyubey: try and open the mixer
 Kyubey: ok now close the mixer, hit ^C in the terminal, then open the mixer again
 Kyubey: fuser -v /dev/snd/* again
 alishah: it all comes down to what you browse pretty much regardless of the browser; the internet is getting more complicated
 Kyubey: then pulse isn't autospawning properly by itself, did you do anything funny like try and get it to run in system mode or mess with it's config files?
 Rockj: i said the time for input has mostly passed for things like that, it's not faulty it's just new
 alishah: then you need to use something like links that doesn't even load images or anything but text; but seriously once you start doing anything else you're pretty much loading what you browse regardless of what's doing it
 Kyubey: well if nothing has been messed with it should be auto spawning; i don't know what to say
 Rockj: no, they didn't remove anything; it's entirely new, that's a red herring
 Rockj: and even asserting it was a good idea when it was added "in the beginning" is another red herring, you simply like it, therefore it is a good idea
 Rockj: i sympathize but it's not a useful way of thinking if you want to improve it, you simply want what you like and use added to the new thing, which kind of defeats the purpose a little
 Rockj: it's a mistake from your perspective
 Rockj: it's a design decision from someone elses perspective
 haroon: installed which one? b43-fwcutter has a script you need to run to do it, and bcmwl-kernel-source would need a reboot, or at least an rmmod ssb & b43 then modprobe wl
 pattysmatty: if you need help or have a question please ask, otherwise take offtopic things to #ubuntu-offtopic
 Kyubey: highly unlikely re: hibernating
 Rockj: theres ayatana which is the cabal running the show, but they're designers and programmers, i don't think they're much accepting that sort of idea, they have a concept already; you at best can ask for them to account for your use-case, if you provide it
 Kyubey is going to be back next time pulse closes & doesn't auto spawn :[
 Rockj: i think you're making the common fallacy of assuming that your use is the same as an uncounted number of users
 Rockj: while that may be true, you can only make the case for yourself; not use these untold number of people to seemingly firm up your position
 AaeRohn: they might, but you need to tell them the issue first
 lucas: you can't distribute that
 lucas: and instaling the proprietary nvidia drivers involves a lot of ugly, you can't generally have both; but there are a bunch of python scripts that try and pick the right one to use
 lucas: then why can't you just install ubuntu to the usb stick, then install the nvidia drivers?
 lucas: the proprietary drivers are decidedly not nice, it's probably a situation you'll have to live with if you use them
 lucas: nouveau ships with natty, maybe you can get by without any proprietary drivers
 gross
 it was obsolete then
 you can still put configuration options in an xorg.conf but you shouldn't want or have to; if something is broke it's probably a bug
 rgr: i'm confident you're filing them instead of just complaining about them
 rgr: the bugs are cases where people need to do workarounds, the default should work
 rgr: if you need one, you are doing something wrong, full stop
 rgr: i do, sorry to break it to you
 rgr: you'll notice that the manual pages for the xorg drivers are still there so you can add workarounds in exceptional situations
 rgr: you say "many", but it's just nvidia's proprietary driver re: xrandr
 rgr: that is an exceptional case with the proprietary nvidia driver, and that's nvidias problem, complain to them
 rgr: that's great, you know nvidia's driver is awful; good on you
 rgr: users have nouveau and xrandr
 ActionParsnip: multiple monitors & static config?
 ActionParsnip: then you don't get the pleasure of what we're talking about
 rgr: you're on a moral crusade my friend
 lucas: indeed, but now it's in wide use
 ActionParsnip: my condolences
 rgr: nvidia is garbage because it doesn't do xrandr 1.2+
 rgr: but one is free and can be improved
 rgr: in many EXCEPTIONAL cases, you may need one
 rgr: but you don't want one if you aren't in an exceptional situation, it's highly higly contraindicated
 rgr: if you're literally talking about an xorg.conf being loaded and read, you're right; it still does that
 rgr: i thought you were just talking about being on a help channel
 !google | rgr
 rgr: if you have information you want to provide, provide it; google provides results almost unique to each user, it will find different things than a google search you run will
 ActionParsnip: what do you use xorg.conf for, adding modes?
 ActionParsnip: if it's not probed by edid or something else that'd still be one ...
 rgr: if you're not helping people it's probably not best to send them off in random directions either
 ActionParsnip: roger, that's why i asked; it's a far more common special case than any of the other ones, and only needed for drivers that don't do xrandr :]
 Caly: hm?
 syn3rgy: #ubuntu-offtopic for opinions, this is a help channel
 Caly: shrug, people rarely know they're the exception to the rule when they're talking about their own habits
 syn3rgy: it should, compiz changed but not to that degree
 syn3rgy: you'll just need to set it up again as compiz changed from .8 to .9 and while theres a settings migrator, it does not migrate a lot of things, and .9 has all new settings
 Rockj: re: usb devices showing up as storage, they often do that now, and the disk mode contains drivers, then the drivers tell it to switch to the actual device; linux does that too, but it needs to know about the device to switch its mode, usb-modeswitch has a database of them, but this new device may need adding
 stittel: -96 uses the old server abi and nvidia said they're not going to be updating them, so it conflicts with the server with the new abi
 AaeRohn: if it only shows up as a usb drive, it needs to be added to the modeswitch database so it can be told to act like the actual device
 stittel: it does work, it just conflicts with the only server api available, so yea ... heh
 stittel: ask nvidia to support the new abi in older drivers, iirc they've already refused; you might have to live with an older release or nouveau
 stittel: good question, but that's the conflict on the package, has been for a long time; there just hasn't been a new server until natty
 stittel: you could probably report a bug and have it removed for natty
 AaeRohn: ah no idea, i was reading into it something you hadn't said; my bad
 Rockj: udev/consolekit should already be applying the correct permissions to those things without him needing to be put in some group
 stittel: sorry theres no good news, does nouveau not work for you? it's getting a lot of attention with this release and should start improving even faster
 arch_is_awesome: run /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh
 arch_is_awesome: no, it just grabbed one package from it
 demlasjr: intel or nvidia?
 timholum: did you try smb://192.168.1.50/ ?
 timholum: nice; haha, well i don't have much to add sorry, that format uri would work in nautilus
 rgr: #ubuntu-offtopic for opinions
 rgr: also unsubstantiated assertions don't help anyone
 rgr: it sounds like you don't really want to be here to help people
 rgr: you need to enable remote access
 rgr: ubuntu uses ufw/
 Nesto: enable remote access first
 Nesto: then you would use a vnc client
 Nesto: what client did you use?
 rgr: save your opinions
 rgr: if you want to debate it, #ubuntu-desktop
 Nesto: right, but what vnc viewer; mstsc wouldn't be expected to work
 !ot | rgr
 Nesto: from realvnc or something?
 Nesto: did you set a password or to ask you when someone connects in the remote access options?
 !ot | rgr
 Nesto: hm, try it without a password, but to ask
 Nesto: i don't know what vnc protocol stuff the builtin vnc server uses, i've just used vino and it worked
 rgr: url to said wiki?
 rgr: trial and error is garbage
 rgr: namely because nobody knows what "error" is, so when they find something that works they've found a nonsolution or work around
 Nesto: it's the vnc client that comes with ubuntu, i just start it from applications -> internet
 !google | rgr
 rgr: i'll ask again if you aren't going to help people to please not speak at all; there are a lot of people looking for help
 Nesto: yes i know, and you said realvnc doesn't work; i said you could try to set it to "ask" instead of taking a password to see if it asks, you haven't done that yet
 Kevin147: not helping
 Kevin147: if something doesn't work that is supposed to work, you don't just try something else
 Nesto: let me know if it asks you to let someone connect if you connect without a password assigned
 ZenGuy311: see what i said to Kevin147
 Kevin147: right, but i'm trying to figure out why the one thing isn't working; suggestions appreciated but distracting people is not
 aaaouhrouarh sigh
 Nesto: good luck, you won't get any support for that, maybe Kevin147 and ZenGuy311 will help you, but it's not software ubuntu distributes so they won't be doing it here
 Nesto: hopefully the problem you're having isn't a genuine bug, as it won't be found and won't be reported now :[
 Nesto: could be, easy enough to check; try and connect to port 5900 on the machine with vnc, though realvnc should have told you if it failed to connect
 Nesto: if it's just your lan i think it's something else; different authentication options and stuff are supported and if theres no common set between the viewer and the server it won't let you authenticate and stuff
 Nesto: okie dokie
 Nesto: can you post the output of sudo iptables -L -v as ran from a terminal to a pastebin?
 Nesto: over wifi, and with an ath9k atheros device?
 Nesto: i don't have a solution, but if it is an ath9k device i can say you're not the only one ;]
 it's like christmas!
 nesto1000: ok thanks, fw is not involved at all and rgr was steering you into the weeds :]
 nesto1000: the firewall is not in the picture; there are no rules in it, so rgr was leading you to a dead end
 Daekdroom: only on bad media i burned at it's "rated" speed, try burning it at 4x or lower
 Daekdroom: the optical drives age can affect how fast it can actually burn too, a rarely used drive might only be able to manage half it's speed reliably
 Daekdroom: i see
 Daekdroom: where did you get the image?
 Daekdroom: for ubuntu right? not kubuntu or some 3rd party derived version?
 Daekdroom: are you verifying that the burned cd md5 matches on the same drive that is reading it when checked from the boot menu?
 Rockj: you can change the compiz settings with ccsm, only some settings are migrated between .8 and .9 versions of compiz
 Nesto: nice :]
 Rockj: that's it
 Rockj: you probably need to bind it, alt+click(+drag) starts a drag for the move plugin too
 Rockj: hm dunno what to say, it raises windows here
 Rockj: the general options have raise & focus behavior tab
 Rockj: and the binding tab has binds for window raising stuff
 Rockj: then look at the bindings page :]
 thejonb: that's normal
 thejonb: unless you get an error reported from apt or whatever is fetching packages you can ignore it
 Flare183: this is a help channel
 Flare183: also the review period for changes in unity was very long, this is the release
 djr013: 11.04 will be supported as it is now, just like any release would; features are generally not accepted for stable release updates, only fixes and for security issues
 Rockj: there was no standard behavior, it's always been up to whatever window manager you were running
 Rockj: right :] just saying, a lot of stuff is grandfathered without too much thought, until it isn't
 djr013: then you'd probably get into an argument with someone over a definition of "bug" :]
 djr013: when working from a design you have one large creative work that pretty much stands alone, you can disagree with the design but it doesn't get to the level of a bug, which is sometimes unfortunate
 quellhorst: ubuntu-desktop
 hah he didn't even do it right
 he just got a lot of people to connect to 81.178.210.42 though
 stravant: is it doing it right now?
 Rockj: it wasn't in irc clients, but the router
 stravant: ok, can you post the output of fuser -v /dev/snd/* to a pastebin
 stravant: ok do the same for pacmd ls
 stravant: thats fine, fuser was just to see who was using controlC0
 stravant: "pacmd ls"
 superlou_: theres deja-dup if you're looking for an alternative ;]
 superlou_: well it's simple, and it will backup when a volume is plugged in if it missed a regular backup; and i can mess with the backupsets with dpulicity, it served all my needs
 stravant: i don't see anything there that is muting anything by itself, finding out what's doing it is going to get ugly, you need to kill pulseaudio and run it in the foreground with logging, so you can see what client is muting it
 unc0nn3ct3d: you could have just asked how to do it
 raymondjtoth: there were changes outside of ubuntu with the 3945 driver that affected ubuntu
 jrenner: ssh will not be accessible if you suspend or hibernate
 jrenner: for all intents and purposes the computer is off
 jrenner: WOL is something else and it can wake computers up from hibernate or suspend, if your bios supports it
 raymondjtoth: you might listen to bazhang, i just know there were some changes and some people had problems
 raymondjtoth: if there was, i don't know it
 jrenner: well i think the OS can have a say in wether WOL will bring the machine out of suspend, but i think it's still down to the bios
 aj00200: it means that each backup won't be a full copy, generally it means it will only store changes to a file, yes
 stravant: yea but it doesn't say what client sent the mute, add -vvv so it's noisier
 Lantech: the kernel and filesystems in it would handle discard and stuff; newer does more, but the long short of it is you'd be looking at kernel changes between versions
 stravant: do you have multiple ovlume controls open? i saw 3 in pacmd ls
 SinnerNyx: if it doesn't depend on anything, rc.local
 SinnerNyx: if it does you probably want a sysvinit/upstart script to start it after the resources you need are available
 magicka: the drivers are there and don't need to be installed, they do need firmware though
 stravant: first 2 have to do with storage volumes, not volumes volumes, i was talking about connected clients in the output of pacmd ls
 oneliner: to update your installed packages
 plummerb: you don't have to do anything
 stravant: i don't know why g-v-c would be muting it by itself; something else is doing it
 stravant: that's what it says, what it doesn't say is why; theres no functionality to automatically mute your sound every 5 seconds in it ;]
 przemoReX: that's a bug in compiz, it sucks; you need to restart it at the moment
 rgr: don't tell people to google
 rgr: if you are not going to personally instruct them, then don't offer any advice
 przemoReX: hm, that's all i've had to do; it breaks drag & drop on the panels too
 rgr: you have an exceptional case and you don't except that, i said that if you mean that it is still read if it is present you are correct
 rgr: but it is highly deprecated and you should never have to edit it, in your case you have to; that's a shame
 rgr: you should talk to your gpu driver vendor
 przemoReX: there are some bugs on launchpad about it, but i haven't looked too closely, restarts have been good enough for my use
 przemoReX: it's been mentioned that it might have something to do with the panel being restarted after compiz; but that's as far as i've seen people looking
 rgr: google returns different results for different people, if you have something in mind for them to read; google yourself and provide it directly, they will not find it no matter how specific the query
 karma_police: join it :]
 karma_police: though it did not work well for me until 10.10, what version are you using?
 karma_police: i connect to my phone all the time; it's rooted with wifi tethering though
 i don't know what barnacle wifi is
 that'd be the place i'd look first for problems
 Kratos: backtrack isn't supported here
 Pierewoj: broadcom or atheros?
 pattysmatty: the one that's packaged is better in my opinion, as it will be updated and stuff :D
 pattysmatty: ff4 is already auto updated like any other package
 madsy: unfortunately your ability to record your desktop relies heavily on the DAMAGE support in your video drivers, and some are very poor
 rgr: wonder somewhere else.
 madsy: what screen recorders have you tried?
 madsy: so you've tried vnc2swf?
 madsy: and istanbul?
 Sledge: ccsm is in the compizconfig-settings-manager package
 and there are no global compiz options, they are all stored in your user session so reinstalling is going to do nothing
 madsy: odd
 madsy: if you can find something that does that, yes :]
 madsy: but you can help recording a lot by disabling compositing and stuff like compiz before you do it
 madsy: damage works kind of well when theres no 3d involved, and something like vnc2swf will have a very low overhead for recording the results in terms of disk space and complexity
 stravant: it's another client, unless you have something binding mute and are hitting it all the time
 rgr: this communication doesn't take place over dbus, so before you call someone silly know what you're talking about
 stravant: it's simple to see, if g-v-c is closed and it still mutes, its' not g-v-c
 stravant: you can see ALL connected clients in the output of pacmd list-clients, that includes all mixers and apps playing sounds
 rgr: my intel card is great
 rgr: did you have an i810? refrain from offering "advice" like that please
 stravant: you can unmute it with the applet, without opening the properties
 rgr: please don't suggest people try sgfxi, it will likely just make a mess someoen else will have to clean up
 osse: fwiw, re: grub, os-prober being in the mix with the menu builder has made it much better :] not just grub
 rgr: please, refrain from speaking at all if you aren't going to be helping people
 Froq: apt-get source linux-image-* (depends on the version you want)
 Froq: that'll check out all the files used to build the package so you can rebuild them yourself; if you want to maintain modifications it might be easier to familiarize yourself with the debian maintainer tools, and stuff like pbuilder
 osse: shrug, just meant to hilight os-prober's role
 rgr: apt-cache search is generally more comprehensible without introducing all the complexity of something like synaptic
 rgr: you referred him to search with something else
 rgr: think about telling a frail old lady to use a computer when all she wanted was a calculator
 rgr: if she already knows about computers it's a bonus, otherwise it is needless trouble
 gurmal: you have garbage characters where there should be spaces
 rgr: synaptic may seem simple to you, and you even know it can search! but if telling someone to run a command that directly shows the information they are interested, and is comprehensible, it is preferable
 Um_cara_Qualquer: "operaco fim de jogo dublado" or so says the gooel result associated with it
 Um_cara_Qualquer: i've found quoting filenames can often get you to the page that references them, doesn't mean you'll fidn anything though :]
 Glowball: they're next to the .iso files in the mirror directory
 Um_cara_Qualquer: np
 Glowball: well i never found a great way to get it without going to the mirrors manually, one sec
 cntrational: ubuntu doesn't detect the resolution, your monitor may or may not have EDID information or the driver might have known modes, lacking these it needs to be told which modes are valid
 Glowball: from the front page "Get ubuntu", "Download and install", "Alternative downloads"
 rgr: the xorg.conf is not there unless you have a proprietary driver (practically speaking, just nvidia) or a custom configuration, on a default install there is no xorg.conf and it's all hot detected
 carandraug: you'd have to create it, but X will still read it
 MrBean: you need room to fetch all the new versionso f packages you have installed already and then some, so if a fresh install had less than half the disk left; upgrades might not be feasible
 MrBean: you can arrange for your package cache for the upgrade to be put somewhere with more storage, though; increasing the disk size is the best idea
 rgr: don't conflate your experience with "grub" "updating" hosing systems, people upgrading and doing things hose systems, if grub or the upgrade process actually did it, it is a bug, and i hope you reported it
 rgr: don't tell people to use sgfxi, other people will have to undo the damage it does to fix their problems
 Froq: iw phy phy0 info
 osse: there often are none, yes; but with upgrades special attention needs to be made if you use ppa's or mangled some of the distro files (which you can do unknowingly if you followed bad advice/workarounds in the past)
 rgr: the point of an upgrade is for them to be the same thing in the end, so what you just said is antithetical to the entire process
 [thor]: and "upgrade" is a strictly utilitarian thing that changes the packages to new versions, it says nothing about functionality
 the important distinction is the things that you can do to break things for an upgrade, which happen; that you sidestep entirely doing a new install
 rgr: quantify "clean"
 [thor]: bummer
 Glowball: that higher power usage amounts to about 3 minutes here, the part that bugs me is the extra 1deg or so it entails on the system/hd temps
 Froq: theres a ton of files in it :] like tons
 Froq: not a million but over 50k
 rgr: it is extracted and prepared if apt-get source is used
 osse: no banshee will get installed as it's a recommend from ubuntu-desktop; but you can remove it, or use rhythmbox, it's really no actual distinction, just that it's a recommended package now
 Glowball: i'd take that with a grain of salt, but i've also seen people reporting 2 separate issues, one of which is their processor being in turbo mode when it shouldn't be; that will account for a lot, since theres no turbo on my cpu it accounts for no additional use here
 Froq: he asked how to get the source code, not how to browse it
 Froq: theres the upstream kernels git browser and launchpads bzr browser for it's local kernel branches
 Froq: first message was meant for rgr
 rgr: you're getting on peoples last nerve with giving people google links
 !google | rgr
 rgr: if you have a link in those google results that you intend to give to a person, give them the link
 rgr: if you have a link in those google results that you intend to give to a person, give them the link
 Froq: if that's all you wanted, you might be interested in http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=tree
 Froq: that's linus' kernel tree; and doesn't include ubuntu patches (they're in their own tree) but if you're not interested in building it or anything, it should suffice
 rgr: #ubuntu-offtopic
 Froq: well it's a very general question, i assumed it was ubuntu related and you wanted to rebuild it or something :] no harm no foul
 lame, the firefox 4 update page no longer has a link to the bugs fixed in that release
 stravant: it didn't "fix" them, it sidestepped the real problem
 stravant: theres nothing special you should have to do; you have software running that is muting things, if its g-v-c and it's doing it without you clicking on mute, find out what it's fighting with
 stravant: i gave you what i thought was all the information that was needed to troubleshoot the problem
 beta____: why do you need emerald? support for transparent themes has been promoted to the other window decorators and you don't need to theme it separately now
 rooly: do you know for a fact that such a patch exists?
 rooly: you should try the module backports and see if it still freezes, but if it doesn't, still file a bug
 rooly: how come you didn't lobby to get it included?
 rooly: if it was known it should have been included
 stravant: ah, it is an sblive isn't it
 rooly: it's not a regression if you needed a patch before ... it's just the same thing?
 rooly: ok if it's broke again in 11.04, then the same patch probably won't work anyways; you should try the backports to see if it's fixed already, and file a bug
 stravant: so some cards treat 0 on the volume as mute, instead of having a separate switch
 stravant: better post the output to aplay -L and pacmd ls again to a pastebin then
 beta____: no solution to install emerald, perhaps you should state why you wish to do that, as emeralds functionality has been in the other window decorators for a long time
 LinuxHack3r: what version of the driver did you try to install? there was an xserver abi change and i don't know if any of the nvidia drivers made it
 LinuxHack3r: generating an xorg.conf isn't going to help if this is your situation
 LinuxHack3r: yes, or use nouveau if you can, it should suffice for the desktop shinyness
 arkanabar: what's l_x_input?
 arkanabar: xinput can still set input device properties
 LinuxHack3r: i think 270 is already ready for the new abi; can you post the contents of /var/log/Xorg.0.log and log.old, and Xorg.1.log?
 arkanabar: oh, you'll have to figure out why it broke with them then, as far as i know nothing important changed with the proper way to set these things
 LinuxHack3r: the log will only be useful from the broken runs of xorg
 LinuxHack3r: copy them somewhere they wont be overwritten
 stravant: theres an existing bug regarding some auto mute & independent output thing that sound chip does
 LinuxHack3r: and lots more, eugh
 MrMist1: it's still done with /etc/hdparm.conf
 stravant: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/609173 don't try the deb though, and there are probably other bugs
 MrMist1: oh it's definitely read, every time there is a power event; your settings probably don't allow the drive to spin down
 MrMist1: post the output of sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda to a pastebin
 MrMist1: there are two other power settings that keep the drive awake, setting the sleep time isn't always going to do it by itself
 stravant: you should probably try contacting diwic, or at least commenting on that bug
 stravant: pulse is just following what the driver is doing, you could probably get an audience with the interested parties (including diwic and themuso) in #pulseaudio, be sure to reference the bug so you don't have to explain it again
 j0nr: atheros broadcom or intel?
 j0nr: a bcm43xx device? you probably need firmware installed
 rgr: if people are asking they generally don't know what they've changed, or they would have undone it then redone it to confirm their suspicions
 j0nr: ah nope, realtek
 j0nr: lots of people have been having problems with those, all i can suggest is trying the module backports and filing a bug
 mikebot: where are you having problems clicking? nobody but me has reported a problem like that with regard to input, and that was with touchpads, and i got it fixed ;]
 j0nr: install linux-backports-modules-net-<version>-generic, reboot
 mikebot: ok, the way sensitivity was measured changed a bit upstream
 mikebot: unfortunately the only way i know to set the sensitivity again is with xinput set-prop, because there is no ui for the changed settings
 rgr: then practically speaking you have said nothing
 rgr: this is a help channel
 illmortal: if you have a question or problem, be specific
 mikebot: mine needed a patch to back out changes, it was doing 2 finger heuristic detection and sending spurious right clicks
 MrMist1: the apm settings can affect how a drive chooses to spin down, the hdparm manual (man hdparm in a terminal) explains in what way
 luisgmarine: you should probably report a bug about that
 illmortal: the top bar in unity isn't a panel, it just looks like it
 rgr: recommended by who? recommended packages are installed by default
 luisgmarine: i can't speak to that, but it should be reported :] then it can be fixed, you're more than welcome to try other spins of the cd to see if it's broken
 rgr: if you need to provide someone with a specific page in a google result, provide the page; even if it is the top or only result for you, it will not be for other people
 ActionParsnip: because one is supported, it's not an opinion; what rgr stated was an opinion held possibly only by himself and he should say as much
 rgr: it is no claim, it's for exceptions and you should never want for or have to change it, if you do, it's a bug
 ActionParsnip: don't go off on the weeds, i meant something specific when i said supported, you took it to mean as it just being in the repos
 rgr: that isn't what i said, i'm sorry we have different definitions of supported
 stravant: there's apparently a mixer control available to alsa to toggle the mute logic off; and make the outputs act independently too
 ActionParsnip: that's not what it means, but i think LjL just settled it enough for my purposes
 LjL: thanks
 ActionParsnip: you don't set Recommends on ubuntu-desktop and upload the package though ...
 ActionParsnip: that doesn't mean it's in main, and it doesn't mean it's "highly recommended" by anyone but rgr, #ubuntu-offtopic
 ActionParsnip: you really just need to ask yourself, are you supporting ubuntu or all the things people can run on ubuntu; if the latter you have an unbounded set, much like backtrack isn't a supported variant, people would rather know the former well and tell people how to use what is supported, to keep the possibilities small
 LjL: i meant things outside of universe, not this particular discussion in general; the overarching one
 LjL: certainly people can also draw the line at main / universe ... but i don't; just minimal support for doing stupid things :]
 ActionParsnip: i was talking about things like teamviewer, which are recommended to be used a lot; but aren't in the repos, i won't help them do it
 ActionParsnip: as LjL said the distinction between main / universe may not matter here; but i was speaking of "support" with the package, and that does involve where it is in the repos
 ActionParsnip: i "support" both, but that was never the sense of the word that i was using, we should take this to message if you have anything further
 MrMist1: press /-B and hit enter in the manual viewer; it will take you right to it
 rgr: in your opinion, be clear
 MrMist1: seagate drives can be pretty weird
 MrMist1: you need to set your options with hdparm initially, if you want to check immediately if they take effect
 MrMist1: to test my hdparm.conf changes i just unplugged and replugged in my power cord on my laptop, that isn't practical for everyone and you can still run the power script manually to apply them immediately
 MrMist1: but best practice, set manually with hdparm, then migrate your settings to be applied to hdparm.conf; and to note that hdparm.conf has settings for when it's on battery and when it isn't
 MrMist1: i dont' know what to say, i'm using 11.04 and it works here, let me triple check right now
 MrMist1: they are being applied here
 my apm level switches between 254 & 128 on ac and off, like i set, and my AAM level is statically set to 128, as i also desire and put in hdparm.conf
 MrMist1: yep, hdparm -I
 MrMist1: well it's run during power events, which as far as i know is at least once during boot
 MrMist1: oh, i dont think it does, but acpi power events might not run on the server version, i do not know
 rgr: do not suggest people use sgfxi, _someone_ has to clean up the mess afterwards, if that someone is you, tell them in private, but not here
 MrMist1: you need not give me any justification, and wasn't your problem that it wasn't being applied?
 MrMist1: well, unless you want to waste your time, let him wonder; let me poke around a bit
 MrMist1: ok didn't have to look much! udev applies hdparm settings when drives show up, so it should apply at boot
 MrMist1: barring udev not working, or you not using an intitramfs or some other odd special situation you've created for yourself, it should work
 MrMist1: don't change those files, they will be overwritten on an update
 MrMist1: er nm that's probably ok
 MrMist1: you can just ask udev to be noisy about what it's doing, and do it without a reboot even
 MrMist1: sec i'll whip up something to run
 MrMist1: udevadm test /sys/block/sdd it will run udev and tell you everything it does, here it says at the end: udevadm_test: run: '/lib/udev/hdparm'
 MrMist1: well test doesn't actually run it, it just says what is done when the device name shows up, ie. what's done at boot
 MrMist1: let me look some more, i don't know of any circumstances where it might be disabled, but it very well may be for some reason on server
 cabbagemoonlight: what's to set up?
 cabbagemoonlight: well key and interactive authentication is enabled by default, so you shoul only need to set it up for extremely specialized situations
 LjL: server has settings for allowed encodings and authentication methods that can be used by the client,  but they rarely need changing
 Augustuen: is it a newer version of a package already in ubuntu?
 !google | _Mr_Proper_
 _Mr_Proper_: and there is a server guide :]
 LjL \is beating me to everything today
 Augustuen: oh 1.2
 Augustuen: what program is it?
 Augustuen: is there something wrong with the version in the repos?
 Augustuen: the version in the repos uses gtk2, what's wrong with the already built packages?
 Augustuen: ah well, i'd be really surprised if it didn't offer a way to build with gtk2, and isn't the ssh part separated from teh ui? is this something you cant use openssl or nss or gnutls for?
 MrMist1: you could but it wouldn't fix whatever problem is stopping it from working as it is now
 MrMist1: rc.local, drives get reset at runtime and stuff so it might not stick forever past boot
 Rehan: i don't think one of the goals was efficiency over existing things
 MrMist1: yea, bonus if you can find the cause, searching to see if there is one already would probably be good
 MrMist1: if udevadm test says it's running the helper then it's not udev
 Rehan: not
 Glycan_: click on the top right thing with your login name, options are at the bottom of the menu
 MrMist1: right, looking into that now; had to get something to eath
 MrMist1: if you do "DEVNAME=/dev/sdd /lib/udev/hdparm" does it apply your settings to sdd?
 ebiester: move it out of the way
 MrMist1: already ate, forgot i was helping someone :o
 ebiester: you shouldn't need an xorg.conf
 ebiester: welcome to this century ;] what do you need a .conf for?
 ActionParsnip: what does that have to do with anything?
 MrMist1: eh ok, with sudo you need to do sudo sh -c 'DEVNAME=/dev/sda /lib/udev/hdparm'
 ActionParsnip: point of fact, he was asking about xorg.conf
 ActionParsnip: i really don't care, this isn't helping this person
 MrMist1: sudo -- sh -c 'DEVNAME=/dev/sda /lib/udev/hdparm' agh ;]
 ActionParsnip: i'm at my wits end, i'm asking why he needs a conf so i can tell him how to regenerate it. seriously back off
 ActionParsnip: if he has an exceptional situataion and needs one, guess what! he needs one
 ebiester: ok
 ebiester: either video card you are using should work with unity, something else is going on
 MrMist1: paste your hdparm.conf to a pastebin
 ActionParsnip: he doesn't have an exceptional situation, he has a vga switcheroo
 ActionParsnip: now kindly do without the interjections of opinion, i'm gonna write you off entirely if you keep it up
 rgr: again, #ubuntu-offtopic, if you have anything to say; lets make it something to help people, that's the entire idea of this channel
 ebiester: well, first, open a terminal and paste the output of glxinfo to paste.ubuntu.com
 MrMist1: you have a stray } :O
 Soothsayer: gnome3 is only available from a ppa right now, so you won't get much support for it here
 Soothsayer: you can try just asking your question, but don't expect a lot ;]
 MrMist1: you need to read the spindown time with a command other than hdparm -I, -I was just to check to see if aam/apm was on, which can impact drives spinning down
 MrMist1: sorry if i wasn't explicit before, i thought you added apm settings to allow spindowns
 MrMist1: try the DEVNAME thing again with the stray } removed
 ebiester: ok so it's not using either of your video cards, but vesa or something; did you use nomodeset when you booted or otherwise have to do anything special to get it to start?
 Soothsayer: no clue on that one, you can create a .desktop file and put it in the right place; that's all the old panel "create launcher" thing did
 Edd: if you don't have a video card or have one without kms, that's a normal message
 rgr: even when you have the potential to answer ... D:
 ADSDS: 11.04, it was released a few days ago
 Soothsayer: ah you'll have to look at other .desktop files that do, something with bamfdaemon does that i think
 ebiester: hm ok so you need to nuke the bits of the nvidia driver left around, did you install the .bin from nvidia or something from a package manager?
 Soothsayer: heh it may not be consoling,  but it's actually simpler now
 Soothsayer: it's at least defined and theres software to do it for you :\
 notlistening: theres no distinction for new windows, it's done as they're all rendered
 notlistening: so if you do per window it's just that window, or the entire desktop it's the whole thing
 Soothsayer: if the launcher is right it should work as expected
 notlistening: if it's to the desktop it still applies to the new window, but let me try here to confirm
 notlistening: wow! that's a bug haha
 notlistening: please report it so i can mark it as affecting me as well, i use it often
 ebiester: ah ok that was probably jockey and it shouldn't have broken anything you can't just remove, sec
 notlistening: post a bug instead, on launchpad.net
 notlistening: that's a functionality change from .8 that i'm pretty sure wasn't intended
 Soothsayer: then it's missing some entries in the .desktop file to make that work
 rgr: who are you speaking to?
 rgr: you need to keep your opinions to yourself, this is a HELP CHANNEL
 rgr: ufw has simple allow/deny rules and hooks for more complicated rules that wont be clobbered by user changes
 rgr: you could argue that average people shouldn't be setting up more than allow/deny rules anyways; and neither should software packages
 rgr: "that good" is your opinion, it is not notable here
 ebiester: let me think a bit, and i didn't say anything
 Guest46633: default fw has no policy
 Guest46633: unless it's different in -server, that's all i know
 kwrite: b43 is the included driver, STA is the vendor one, did jockey used to offer the b43 driver? it only ever needed the firmware, which you can get by installing b43-fwcutter and running the included script
 rgr: that's great, ubuntu uses ufw; thanks
 ActionParsnip: how come you never chime in to undo the mess done to peoples computers by the nvidia drivers like ebiester ?
 kwrite: i don't have it installed here, but dpkg -L b43-fwcutter will list the files after it's installed, the script is the one ending in .sh
 notlistening: thanks
 notlistening: i did yea, but i haven't been able to use it satisfactorily with compiz .9, very very very awful slow
 LjL: i just figured after being so hawkins over xorg.conf he'd be really on top of things, but i guess that's just me
 MrMist1: you shouldn't need it mounted,  but your firmware might ignore what you tell it, or it might be entangled with the other power/noise settings like i said earlier
 notlistening: ah i didn't try it with unity
 kwrite: the firmware name might have changed, but on my netbook where it was required i don't recall ever having to rename it, dunno what to say
 kwrite: i could just be misremembering and i've been using the STA driver all along though ;]
 twiggydanger: natilus
 twiggydanger: you don't want to run it as root though ...
 rgr: address the person you're talking to please, there's a lot of people talking
 kwrite: ;] i use STA because my card eventually starts acting like the chip is overheating with the open driver, drops connection and stuff
 twiggydanger: it's nautilus, but what i'm saying is you probably want to do what you're trying to do some other way, nautilus is a big thing to run as root and mistakes are easy
 MrMist1: hm interesting
 MrMist1: there were some changes about delayed settings applications with libata way back when, it probably doesn't even try and talk to the drive until it's in use for something
 MrMist1: if you want your sleep settings to be applied be sure to run whatever you need to with hdparm to tell the drive to save the settings over resets; it still might not do it, but it's the best you can do given the circumstances
 twiggydanger: you can use chown -R ...
 FearXFactorX: of what? do you have a question?
 whinis: did yours break? it really isn't appropriate to take a poll here; mine didn't break though, fwiw
 twiggydanger: -R, yea, and it will only change the owner, you need to do something else to change the permissions; so it won't clobber any that might have been set on purpose, just the owner
 twiggydanger: well there's a manual (man chown) and it's chown -R user(:group) /dirorfile, but yea, that's it
 Rehan: you know that ondemand overall saves battery by completing work quicker right, or do you want to do that for thermal reasons or something?
 Rehan: hm you should probably troubleshoot those then, they can usually be fixed
 rgr: #ubuntu-offtopic
 rgr: ufw is also a firewall, gufw is a gui for it, read about ufw if you want to know why
 agh @ when they do that
 Rehan: well that's not really the knob to adjust if heat is your problem, that's what i'm saying
 Rehan: finding out why it's so hot, and stopping whatever you can that's making it hot; last time this came up someone had a problem device that was burning cpu, and he was able to just disable it
 Rehan: i know it's not ubuntu specific when you asked it ;]
 Rehan: is it really poorly designed or are the thermal zones incorrect in the bios?
 asdf_msc: you'd probably fare better asking in #winehq or checkign out the appdb, that's pretty much just a wine issue
 Rehan: the bios contains tables that tells linux about the fans and the zones they manage ,and all their trip points and stuff; it's more than just the settings
 asdf_msc: it'd still be wine; they're the ones fitting the square peg in the round hole :]
 rgr: #ubuntu-offtopic
 rgr: those don't have anything to do with the session manager
 kfizz: it wouldn't be there
 rgr: i wish you'd hold your tongue, you lead people off into the weeds & other people have to bring them back, you're deliberately creating work for other people with more interest in helping than yourself
 Cale: open synaptic and see waht it thinks are being held or pinned
 kfizz: if you're trying to get your applets back with unity, you probably cant; it's not a real panel
 owner: if you have a question, ask it, otherwise #ubuntu-offtopic
 Cale: not that i know of, i don't use synaptic much; probably why i've never had a problem :O
 owner: dunno what to say
 Stereocaulon_: that's the presence menu, i dunno that you can
 jbsoum: you need to turn on the decorator plugin in compiz, did you actually uninstall all the packages with *unity* in the name or just use the other session?
 rgr: keep your opinions to yourself
 jbsoum: ok weird, the window decorator shouldn't have been messed with then; but you just need to turn it back on
 Stereocaulon_: well it's been available for review for a long time, most people only care after release though
 jbsoum: open ccsm from compizconfig-settings-manager and tick on the decorator plugin
 ActionParsnip: he probably doesn't have +x permission for the directory
 ActionParsnip: that lets you list files in a directory :]
 Stereocaulon_: well protest ... i don't think that's really effective, people inflate themselves into "tons of people" who happen to agree with them, even if you don't people don't take it with much weight; only thing you can really do is not care or get involved in the decisions made in the next version
 ActionParsnip: you can't list files in a directory without +x for your user, but you can create files there, and everything else; it's a tip for you since you're helping the guy
 ownwhat was it?
 rgr: people can't usually infer who you're talking to unless you address them, channel often moves past what you're replying to pretty fast too
 ActionParsnip: i could be mistaken, that's my understanding btu i haven't checked
 Stereocaulon_: agreed, which is why i'm not using anything that doesn't have gnome-panel in it
 ActionParsnip: well, shrug; yea i guess, but it's grandfathered from classic unix permissions
 ActionParsnip: there are other bits with special meanings on directories, x just happens to overlap directly with one that can be set on a file too
 ActionParsnip: i think it's cute you can have a directory you otherwise have full permission to aside from listing its contents; makes lots of things easy
 ActionParsnip: you can still directly modify files you know the name of, or execute them or whatever
 eamon_: theres nobody that can quantify how secure it is, that's a decision someone makes knowing full well what it does, and deciding for themselves how secure they need it
 eamon_: and while encryption may be mathematically resplendent, when people are involved they compromise it greatly; so you can't evaluate eitehr one in isolation
 Stereocaulon_: np, everyone has lots to go around :]
 eamon_: if you really want some data you have to be secure you should segregate it and store it securely, that need not even include encryption, but often does; if you just go and encrypt everything the information you want to protect becomes as important as everything else, or the whole volume becomes very hard to secure
 eamon_: ehh well theres lots of files with information people can use; that's why its important to choose what information you want to protect
 eamon: even stuff in /var/log can contain identifying information as to usage patterns, when you turned your laptop on or off, what wifi you were connected to; that might not seem like anything at all but it does give away quite a bit
 eamon: best advice i can give is decide what information really matters, and keep it separate and secure, you can get mozilla/ff to use pcks11 and stuff as well
 cached: what if they did and they came to a different conclusion than you did? there's a funny thing about human behaviour ...
 Senix: wherever you got the software should have instructions on how to install it; what software is it?
 manOwl: don't you just drag it after you searched for it?
 or click on it or something, after it's launched
 Senix: ah
 Senix: well run it as instructed, but you could use checkinstall as well to track installed files and uninstall it later if you wish
 Senix: probably just sh file.run
 manOwl: you should have spoke up during prereleases D: it's not like it just came into existence when natty was released
 manOwl: fair enough, but there's only so much you can ask for if you opted out of the entire process
 manOwl: i've been finding that out over the last year or so :]
 manOwl: please do, the blank icon thing you just mentioned sounds like a real bug
 much appreciated
 manOwl: and in a manner of speaking, unity is not ready for primetime yet, insofar as they wanted to release it and people to use it; it's not an LTS afterall, all these eyes on it now, and yourself and others filing bugs will straighten it out pretty fast
 manOwl: well it's a design, they need to flesh it out as a whole to see if it works, which is a tough thing to do
 manOwl: yea theres not a lot they can do about that, those are provided files; they did put a lot of icons for popular software into the main ubuntu icon theme though
 manOwl: ehhhh that's not something that's really done unless there's no maintainer, and everyone has a different idea of what's good and what isn't
 manOwl: yea what guntbert said, this has kind of ran off from me explaining things to a mini rant, which isn't appropriate here
 manOwl: i thought that was weird too :D it searches uninstalled software
 manOwl: fixing that will probably come with popcon and ratings from software-center, which are new; but will eventually rank used software to some degree, then they can be sorted when provided as suggestions for not yet installed software
 rgr: address who you are talking to
 rgr: please
 !who
 Aikar: on launchpad.net, you can use ubuntu-bug to fill in some default fields for you too
 Ultimate_Chaos: i don't know much about practical use of unity, as i don't use it myself
 Juest: you don't need to justify what you want to do, insofar as that people might want to know what you're doing so they can offer a better solution
 Juest: the problem with lilo being so ancient is you have constraints on what filesystems it can read to get access to its boot files, chances are it's not going to work
 rgr: it's still in the repositories, if you don't have anything to add please stop
 Juest: i doubt it
 Soothsayer: yes, and the group is "admin"
 Soothsayer: you mean people who are able to sudo, no?
 Soothsayer: you don't want to do that
 Soothsayer: you want to add a user to the group able to edit files there
 Soothsayer: or set it up so it looks for files elsewhere for your user
 id10t: http://isup.me/www.linux.org
 Soothsayer: i presume the group is "www", no?
 rgr: apache doens't follow symlinks by default, and you have to setup mod_userdir otherwise
 whatever you do, don't change permissions on those files, change the users you want to access those files
 Soothsayer: theres a ubuntu server guide to setup and do most tasks with apache as well
 Soothsayer: i suggest reading the user guide, it tells you  how to setup virtual hosts, and they can store their files in your user directory; don't go modifying the in place files
 Soothsayer: then use the tools to do it :D don't stick symlinks in random places
 Soothsayer: i suggest leaving the default and creating a site for the actual host it'll be reachable by
 Soothsayer: it's important to never mess with deployed files permissions, they come from the maintainer and are set appropriately, you might introduce a security problem changing them
 notlistening: it has a "Recommends" in ubuntu-desktop, that's all it amounts to ;]
 derp
 o hai
 JoseeAntonioR: xorg.conf still works in 11.04
 JoseeAntonioR: can you restate what you're trying to do for me?
 JoseeAntonioR: that's really odd, your server is running right now with the nouveau driver?
 JoseeAntonioR: open a terminal and run glxinfo, copy its output to paste.ubuntu.com
 JoseeAntonioR: ok you aren't using nouveau, or the intel driver; where did you read that it was using the nouveau driver?
 JoseeAntonioR: odd, that might be a bug in system testing; theres no visible to the OS nvidia card in there
 JoseeAntonioR: i see that theres only software rendering going on, so likely no gpu drivers are being loaded, did you boot with nomodeset or do anything related?
 JoseeAntonioR: oh nevermind, thats i810 hw
 Jettis: afaik i915 still handles i810 on the kernel side
 jetole: ^
 JoseeAntonioR: all i've heard about i810 is it not really working for 3d or anything as of the last year or two; i don't know what to say
 celthunder: that may have been true 2 years ago (before support for anything but kms was dropped in the intel drivers)
 i810 might still be a special case but i don't think so
 nyquist333: if you're going to disable all of the caching you need to disable all of their generation in the first place
 nyquist333: are you having a specific problem?
 nyquist333: i can probably help you with t he original problem
 nyquist333: hurf
 nyquist333: whats the scenario where this information you're concerned about gets disclosed? maybe something can be done about that
 nyquist333: it's not tracking you, even if it might be called tracker
 or zeitgeist
 nyquist333: i talked with ebassi about getting a blacklist aqdded for that, but it's Hard(TM), i want it so video i'm logging doesn't push out useful entries in the recently used list
 nyquist333: you aren't protecting your privacy doing that ... le snoop on your fils and you leave your session unlocked with many people to poke around on it
 nyquist333: use inotify-watch from inotify-tools to do the cleanup you want
 nyquist333: theres also a record of the volume in gconf for your view preferences ;]
 nyquist333: you could always use a guest session, it's wiped out after log on; theres going to be an unbounded list of things to clean up
 nyquist333: check out /apps/nautilus/desktop-metadata
 nyquist333: i hope you don't have a swap file ;] really if you take this to the reaches of silly ness it will be quite silly
 not a good idea
 nyquist333: it's just the volume name and some things
 nyquist333: it's not bad to remember where things are
 nyquist333: it's just to keep the user from having to set it again, over and over
 JoseeAntonioR: it's not just your monitor; it's not using an accelerated  driver, that may be the only mode
 JoseeAntonioR: you on't get a solution but you might try asking in #intel-gfx what the status of the driver for your hw is
 nyquist333: ugh are you joking about encryption
 kneaux: use ccsm from compizconfig-settings-manager, the unity plugin
 kneaux: if you mean the thing at the top that looks like a panel, it's not a panel :\
 cthuljew: configure what?
 nyquist333: humans are the weak link, encryption is no panacea & encrypting everything is a liablity
 razor__: this is a help channel
 kneaux: after it's installed run ccsm from a terminal or alt+f2, it's also in system -> preferences
 nyquist333: no, liability, encrypting everything means its all as valuable as the most valuable thing in it, or as useless the rest in it
 nyquist333: things "leak" only if you let them, if it's important for it not to show up on a computer perhaps its prudent not to involve a computer
 nyquist333: you control assets that  are important and segregate them, you don't mix them with other stuff then put a bandaid over it
 nyquist333: firefox also supports pkcs11
 nyquist333: it's good
 nyquist333: if your browser will contain important information you can't keep out of it, it's a good thing to use
 tyr: top right menu, with your login name; click it and pick settings
 nyquist333: no
 nyquist333: i have no idea what people consider normal, but my grandma expects to be able to search here computer & is quite coonfused when it doesn't include email and other things she's done
 nyquist333: if the stuff is on your computer you don't need indexing or caching to find it; it's still on the computer
 i have porn and other things on my computer i'd be a bit embarassed about, but it's a calculated risk
 xust-: is there something wrong? do you have a question?
 nyquist333: if you store it and your storage leaves your custody theres little to do
 PythonPup: who mentioned wayland?
 rondinelli: because natty isn't maverick, do you still need the backports?
 rondinelli: it's net-natty now
 rondinelli: but the backports in mav were from the natty kernel, you probably don't need them now
 PythonPup: a very silly answer, it implies it's useful at al
 rondinelli: were these instructions for maverick?
 jrt4: a regular apt-get update style upgrade should carry you all the way
 Jordan_U: fwiw i've seen a lot of people having trouble with ath9k stuff in 11.
 Jordan_U: nobody ever got back to me after trying the backports in natty
 cached: they didn't switch from gnome
 cached: they wrote a plugin for compiz and made a session to start it with it in a new session
 PythonPup: ehh
 cached: na; that's just the WM
 cached: 99.99% of the rest is the same
 cached: the time for those comments passed a long time ago
 cached: plus we don't really "help" with past design decisions
 cached: you can switch back, right now unity is where the action is
 cached: the old session with panel & nautilus goodies will remain
 PythonPup: lets not speculate, and by lets i mean you :]
 thien: xrandr if your driver can do it
 thien: if you still need to do it you'll probably need extra for other outputs too
 PythonPup: nein
 PythonPup: unless ubuntu is rewriting the 99.99% left that composes their user facing desktop
 PythonPup: gnome is a huge collection of software, which the shell is a small but important part
 badbandit: pick classic from the login screen at the bottom, after clicking on your name
 badbandit: it's not broken if it's a new thing :]
 badbandit: it's hard to unlearn
 PW-toXic: there should be a log somewhere that indicates why they started rebuilding
 mah454: that was something an app did
 mah454: most apps that put garbage in that area aren't in the whitelist so their icon doesn't show
 PW-toXic: /var/log, and dmesg if it was recent
 xust-: some people might expect you to ask nvidia for support for their drivers, too
 ugh that crap apport asks you with ubuntu-bug is awful
 PW-toXic: no clue
 crlcan81: you don't own the audio device after you log out, what sound can you make? :]
 mathews: networkmanager still does vpns, maybe you need to install the package for the type you need?
 newb_: gnome3 is only available as a ppa right now, and is not really suppotred here
 newb_: someone might answer if it's not too specific to gnome3 but it's still a pot shot here
 ASDF_: your statement doesn't match my own experience, perhaps it's an opinion?
 uabn93: purge any ppas you use :]
 ASDF_: please don't discuss your failures in here unless you can assist someone to  figure out what it is
 uabn93: ppas are unsupported 3rd party software, a good way to break things
 ASDF_: that's not true
 kz3: no
 uabn93: :] anything you manually install in directories managed by the package manager can cause troublr too
 ppk_: you shouldn't have to do anything for that
 ppk_: perhaps you should describe your problem instead
 ppk_: did you attempt to disable or remove pulseaudio?
 !best | ASDF_
 ppk_: no, i asked what you might have done; it was not instructive
 ppk_: vlc should not be blocking anything if pulse hasn't been messed with, or vlc has been configured to do a bad thing
 PythonPup: i'm not interested in anything but specifics
 ppk_: if it uses alsa and opens hw:0 it will make a mess, make it use pulse & lets find out what the crackling is
 PythonPup: good to know, i don't recommend people use vlc anyways ;]
 ppk_: yes, or don't change the defaults at all
 thegoodcushion: this is not the place for debate, this is a help channel
 ppk_: ok post the output of pacmd ls to a pastebin
 thegoodcushion: the "stable" part is a steady version of the software that receives backports and fixes
 ppk_: ok, first thing to test, add tsched=0 after load-module module-udev-detect in /etc/pulse/default.pa, restart pulse with pulseaudio -k
 ramin: there are gains and losses with shifts between versions; you didn't ask a question anyone can answer
 ramin: find someone who has ran benchmarks on eachversion against a feature you care about
 mathews: as much as you hear about failed upgrades, you never hear the circumstances or why; so if you could hold off on recommending that here i'd appreciate it
 sebastian: ccsm is in compizconfig-settings-manager, didn't it say that along with the error message?
 uabn93: because that's not what happens, new versions of any given package are generally not available after a release
 uabn93: if you have a real reason to want the new kernel there are things you can do, but i only recommend it if you can't get your video to work; and only to help finding a fix to backport
 op_amp: -d is only for upgrading to development versions
 carandraug: theres no real way to translate the different commands
 carandraug: as has been suggested already, you might just import anything into git for local work; that's what i do, even if i'm preparing patches for projects with other cvs
 ppk_: nope, see if the crackle is still there
 bullgard4: still doesn't matter; he stated he wanted to upgrade to natty not a development version
 ppk_: pulse might have not restarted from the sounds of things, see that it is; config might have got mangled with the edits
 ppk_: try running pulseaudio -vvvv
 ppk_: add it on the same line as the udev-detect one
 ppk_: yep
 Etherael: sounds like no driver for acceleration is being loaded, look and see if it says "software" in the output of glxinfo
 no idea brah
 ppk_: right, part of that is the reason for checking if it goes away with tsched too
 ppk_: except disabling tsched also covers another bad driver problem with timing & wakeups, that after you suspect you have it, theres another tool to confirm
 ppk_: try what you did befre and see if it crackles
 ppk_: yes, and pulse is running, play some sounds
 freeman_: right clck on a torrent file, properties, open
 er
 freeman_ -> freaky[t]
 ppk_: ok theres a problem with the driver for your device on that machine, remove the tsched stuff & restart pulse again
 freaky[t]: i can't help what you don't want; i told you how to do it
 Hoyt: look at the files in /etc/modprobe.d for examples
 freaky[t]: ;]
 ppk_: read the whole thing, tool to test is about halfway down http://pulseaudio.org/wiki/BrokenSoundDrivers
 freaky[t]: no harm no foul
 ppk_: apt-get install libasound2-dev
 ppkare you using 10.10 or 11.04?
 Rehan: theres a way to overlay local icons ettings but i don't know what it is, i'd read the icon spec on fd.o D:
 Rehan: freedesktop.org
 Rehan: soon, soon
 PST
 DeejayRoby4: more specifically, nobody answered
 ppk_: you need to run it on the idlest machine possible
 ppk_: but that could signal another driver problem too
 cadmium: ati or intel?
 grr
 Cairo|Mac: ati or intel
 Cairo|Mac: what was supposed to be on the screen? i've seen corruption like that but with defined contents
 in what?
 the ctrl-alt-f1 screen?
 alt-f1 opens the applications menu
 virgo: open a terminal and try running it from there (software-center) it will show some output
 Cairo|Mac: post the output of lspci to paste.ubuntu.com
 Cairo|Mac: no need to paste it from text mode, unless its all you can get
 Sharan: #ubuntu-offtopic
 Sharan: this is a help channel
 Cairo|Mac: sounds more severe than i can help you with at the moment
 ppk_: ok
 virgo: it looks like it's having a problem loading an icon
 ppk_: you should have enough information to start askingn about possible problems and getting them fixed on the alsa mailinglist
 bullgard4: find nhandler and ask him?
 ppk_: you send an email :] you could ask in #pulseaudio, coling or one of the other people might be able to help; or even file & follow up for you, but right now i've got to go to sleep
 bullgard4: hm?
 ppk_: thanks for probably getting the driver fixed! :D
 bullgard4: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/nhandler
 PythonPup: you can skip that step too
 Ubuntu_user: the sun jdk/jre is in the partner repos
 bullgard4: i've found all the ubuntu related people imminently contactable ;]
 Ubuntu_user: netbeans 6.3 is in the repos too
 PythonPup: with 11.04 you don't even have to do that, software-center knows how to enable sources that aren't enabled to get at packages
 Ubuntu_user: i didn't mean running it like ./
 Ubuntu_user: i mean sh ./whatever
 virgo: install the icons it's looking for
 Ubuntu_user: nothing changed with the shell that would break running it directly, other things, maybe; but not the shell starting it
 Ubuntu_user: you should use the jdk/jre in the repos, and netbeans 6.3 if it's sufficient; they will track and update installed files and you don't have to make a mess
 gn0: i don't know about vaapi, you can check the vaapi repo and see, it's pretty threadbare for answering questions like that; but generally the new cards are fairly well supported, engineers are working on drivers before general availability
 jwmto: can you describe the problem?
 peto_: are you using unity? that thing at the top isn't a panel and that isn't an applet; the old one still exists but it lives on a panel D:
 ActionParsnip: it's not weird when people have been trying random model options and not reporting bugs :D
