 hello
 hello, is there someone who can help me?
 on my laptop, I upgraded the new version, 11.04
 it won't boot up, and I have tried to re install using the cd, and it still won't work, I don't know what to do?
 I see the background first, and then it goes black and nothing
 I tried to reinstall the last version using the cd, and that won't boot either
 I can't even get to the grub
 hello
 is there another way to get help, I cannot follow this?
 thank you, I will try that
