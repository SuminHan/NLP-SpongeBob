 dear colleagues, please help configure dansguardian with privoxy on lubuntu 10.10 - i've done accroding to howtos, but either privoxy isn't used or doesn't let me go through it. i suspect there arte problems with iptables rules
 how to make lubuntu automatically connects to wi-fi network on my eee pc 701?
 ActionParsnip: thanks, u'r right. it was simple & done
 can sill anybody help me with privoxy? my comp is connected to a wi-fi network (i'm using a wifi router). i wnat to set up on my kids' comp privoxy and dansguardian. but no success so far
 well, i've read articles and manuals accroding to them squid is slower than privoxy
 the problem i doesn't work
 looks like i've got to set up iptables, too. done as in manuals - no connection, no internet or no proxibiting bad sites
 i need privoxy only for a local machine to make it work with dansquardian
 kellnola: privoxy is also simple in settings, but nothing works. i even tried tinyproxy. looks like i'm doing something wrong. i suspect i can't setup iptables correctly
 ok, any suggestions? i know that privoxy works as an adblock, too. what i need is a lightweight simple solution for parental control
 but this seems to be a pain in the ass on ubuntu
 tried several things, though
 firewall? what firewall i'm not using any unless there's a preinstalled one in lubuntu
 so in order to run a browser through proxy just changing browser settings doesn't work
 i don't think i have to look at anoither server cause the problem in setting, imho. on lubuntu there is no an applet to change proxy setting for chromium, i change it form the command line, and it seems to be fine. still don't understand why i enter internet bypassing the privoxy
 anyone still who can help me with my troubles regarding setting up dansguardian , privoxy on lubuntu,
 i'm in desperate situation. please help me finally setup dansguardian on my kids' comp running lubuntu 10.10. done everything according to manuals - nothing works. please help
 still no luck with dansguardian & privoxy
 all porn sites can be accessed, what am i doing wrong?
 i mean "can", dansguardian+privoxy is a web control filter
 i don't wanna my kids access porn sites
 coz_: i've installed dansguardian + privoxy (if these na,es tell you something) to prevent accessing "bad" sites
 but it doesn't work for some reason
