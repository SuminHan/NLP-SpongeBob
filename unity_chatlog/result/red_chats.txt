 Been a lot of traffic since the release? :)
 Big problems?
 I'm using ubuntu at work and wondering if I should upgrade to Natty? Could not find much info about what kind of files\settings I should back up
 bullgard4: is there any info what the worst bugs are for now?
 (apart from browsing the tracker)
 >bullgard4| red: You should not. Better wait and see if the many bugs get fixed.
 was refering to this :)
 I was under the impression I could continue using Gnome 2 if Unity didnt work well for me?
 Ok good
 Only time I've had problems installing from USB was when I checked the checbox to make it possible to save temp files on the USB stick
 bobby_: It won't erase your XP
 Unless you specify it to that it
 Anyone using Google Chrome with Natty and has chromes own minime\max\close buttons
 if I click "use OS menu bar" i get double ubuntu buttons
