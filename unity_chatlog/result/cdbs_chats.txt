 Witchsong: You mean in 11.04?
 PhoenixSTF: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/04/compiz-cube-natty/
 pindropper: Try sudo service apache2 restart
 pindropper: Just after installation there can be problems like that
 gaara: What are the problems?
 gaara: Which GPU?
 pindropper: modify /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and write in it: ServerName 127.0.0.1
 pindropper: then run that command again
 roasted_: There is some work ongoing to port it to Fedora, they've had quite much success
 gaara: did you upgrade or fresh-install?
 roasted_: Debian folks were also interested, but they didn't start work (yet)
 gaara: Does it work well from the LiveCD?
 gaara: So does nomodeset work now?
 roasted_: yes, just available, not default (yet)
 gaara: Try running sudo update-initramfs, then sudo update-grub2, then set nomodeset again, then reboot
 roasted_: They don't have an aim like us. Their main aim is to ship all the desktops out there (Debian) or provide something which is and was very much popular as GNOME (Fedora)
 !ot | roasted_
 roasted_: better move this discussion to #ubuntu-offtopic
 gaara: yep, should be enough for now
 gaara: Give it a try, I'm not sure about it
 gaara: but in either case, won't do any damage
 its safe to proceed
 mustafa: wait for a while, he'll test if a possible fix works
 mustafa: he hasn't come back yet
 raju: same problem here
 raju: Oh wait, its working now, wasn't working yesterday
 raju: Try asking that in #zeitgeist
 raju: I just started it normally
 ror: Just comment on that bug that its affecting you on Natty
 ror: BTW, #ubuntu-bugs is a channel for bug questions
 mustafa: I'm alsso waiting for gaara to come back, after that I'll know
 raju: I didn't get you. What do you want to do ?
 raju: Ask your question in #zeitgeist

 truepurple: yes, almost all applications have been updated
 truepurple: its much faster as well
 truepurple: I'm using it :)
 mustafa: Gaara not back yet :( Well, you can give it a try. What's the exact problem you're facing?
 gaara: Same problem? :(
 gaara: So how did you set nomodeset on livecd?
 gaara: hmm
 gaara: too bad, well, did gnome-panel session come up or did unity come up after setting nomodeset?
 MichealH: It doesn't do that itself?
 MichealH: Install ccsm, type about:config in Alt+F2, set option there
 gaara: shouldn't make a difference
 gaara: And is the problem with nomodeset set is the same as it came while installing?
 gaara: then I don't think a lot can be dome
 sfdsafdsafdsa: Select 'ubuntu classic desktop' session at login
 gaara: I am both
 gaara: pm
 MichealH: compizconfig-settings-manager
 mustafa: I don't think a lot can be done
 mustafa: Which GPU?
 ElNino: Normal Windows? Select Ubuntu Classic session at login
 mustafa: weird then. When you click 'Try Ubuntu' what comes?
 ElNino: screenshot please, I can't understand
 ElNino: which theme are you using?
 ElNino: Try running unity --reset from Alt+f2, if that doesn't fix it then re-check theme settings and make sure its ambiance
 ElNino: gaara  mustafa Okay, I gotta go, bye
