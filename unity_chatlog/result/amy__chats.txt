 I just upgraded to Natty Narwhal (11.04) and my desktop seems to have changed quite a bit. Can I revert to the classic look, rather than the scrolling sidebar thing?
 just curious, but are all the *BSD channels normally invite only?
 I havent been entirely fond of the 11.04 upgrade, myself. My flash player is a bit glitchy, but still workable, other than that, I just needed to reset my sound stuff and set classic login again.
 spikebike, my 10.10 was -perfect- with Flash, for some reason 11.04 messed with that a bit.
 bp0, yeah
 bp0,  thanks, i'll actually give that a go.
 bp0, yup, after doing a test/execute with flash-aid, worked like a charm again. Thanks for the tip :)
 is there any Ubuntu installations that exclude X/graphical stuff?
 could I do a net install for server/minimal instead of using a burned CD?
 Im thinking I'll swap my FreeBSD machine to Ubuntu server or minimal.
 bp0, also a good idea. I was considering disabling my screensaver altogether.
 bp0, thumbdrive install instead?
 I dont think I have any spare CD's sitting about
 when using the startup disk creator and it asks about updates, etc. It won't try and install it on the system I'm creating the USB startup drive from, will it?
