 atlef, that did not seem to help .. it looks right just after login, but then a few seconds later it is as if something crashes and it defaults to a gnome look
 ok
 a few seconds after login something crashes that cause my desktop to revert from ubuntu look to a default gnome look ... does anyone please have any ideas for how to fix this?
 what program creates the slick, dark grey ubuntu look with the monocrome icons in the notification area and so on?
