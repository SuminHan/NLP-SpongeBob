 hello
 Ubuntu 11.04 will not install for me, my laptops backlight will now work when i run the installer
 same here alex13
 the backlight wont work
 very unimpressive
 Intel, not sure exactly i got an emachine e725
 ive tried multiple times to get installer for 11.04 work but no go
 anybody got any ideas?
 maybe we should stick to LTS only and hope 12.04 LTS fixes this issue
 so 11.04 is a fail?
 well it doesnt work
 i would like for it to work, for me it is a fail
 i cannot even install it
 installer is black, ive tried redownloading, buring and usb
 nope not it
 intel
 Intel GMA 4500M graphics
 will do
 unity the replacement for gnome in 11.04
 correct
 i stand corrected
 but u cant install 11.04 because it doesnt work with my laptops backlight dont work with it
 i made the assumption that it would be fixed by final release
 next time ill make a report before final is released, because i did try the beta and alpha and had same issue
 internal server error on ubuntu bug tracker
