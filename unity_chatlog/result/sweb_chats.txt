 qin, i need stable v of gnome with good support

 BlouBlou, qin, i'm expert ubuntu user. i'm php programmer that i can compile complex mod, module and plugins for LAMP. i know where can i change the theme. System > Preferences > Appearance > Theme. all theme in list like Dust, Ambiance and etc.. gnome still have old icons and old colors. gnome looks like completely splinted
  qin, any idean ?
 qin, how can i reset gnome setting completely ?
