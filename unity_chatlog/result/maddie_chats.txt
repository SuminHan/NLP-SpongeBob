 Help help Launcher Icons Revert to Default Upon Login
 I've been looking for an answer for two days now and have come up with nothing. Essentially the launcher icons revert to default upon every damn login even when I uncheck them or check new ones!
 Does anyone understand what could be wrong?

 step 21, nope
 step 21, I used the update manager
 step21, okay, do you know of any helpful resources other than askubuntu, this irc, /r/linuxquestions, asklinux, ubuntu forums, and the ubuntu launchpad?

 terry hmm well... maybe that's part of my problem. okay, on a fresh install of 11.04 unity there are default icons (these inclide libreoffice, ubuntu one, etc) When I try to modify these, as in remove them form the launcher or add new ones to the launcher, all is well until I log back in - the same default sequence is there (libreoffice, ubuntu one)
 terry sorry for grammar mistakes it's early
 Can someone please help me? launcher doesn't remember custom icons!!

 In unity
 knifepoint for me I just get the default set that comes with a fresh install
 knifepoint that's not the problem - it's the actuall programs I pin to the launcher that get erased upon login

 knifepoint I've submitted the question 6 time in different forums and have spent a great deal of time here and still haven't gotten an answer.
 knifepoint, yeah. to be honest I was pretty enthusiastic about it for a while despite all the complaints from the community. This problem is making it hard to learn to love it.
 knifepoint, it's okay thanks anyways (:
 knifepoint, do you think I could somehow replace the launcher with docky in unity?
 knifepoint, alright thanks for the advice
 knifepoint, hope you get your problem solved too
