 Hello. Am I blind or that Unity bar is completly uncustomable? E.g. I want to add also folders there, edit width etc...
 removing gnome applets such as weather, notification area... sux :(
 sebsebseb: thanks... yeah, that sux :/
 I miss the notification area the most! How can I easily see what am I playing in Rhythmbox, if my Dropbox is synced or everything else is happening? For this I must go back to Ubuntu Classic
 hypetech: thanks man!
 I have a folder ~/Desktop/TV Serials/Himym - when i try to search "TV Serials" it finds the folder. When I search "Himym" it finds nothing. Does this happen to you?
