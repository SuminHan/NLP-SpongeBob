 hello...when i turn an interface down with ifconfig wlan0 down it does not STAY down, auto starts back up within a few minutes.  how do i prevent it from auto starting, thanks ?
 Chipzzz: i am in ssh not a gui, what is the service or command I need to stop it ?
 Chipzzz: that works and i got a nice message about it being converted to an Upstart job
 Chipzzz: so i'll use stop next time...i am now back to trouble shooting my upgrade.  reason i am in ssh session is because i got no desktop after upgrade
 Chipzzz: just my old wallpaper
 Chipzzz: lol no problem its not a critical machine just my Kids desktop
 Chipzzz: although it is annoying that it basically bombed  i have two distinct problems.. the network was excruciatingly slow on wireless nic and no desktop
 Chipzzz: been googling all day trying to fix it
 so in my upgrade to 11.04 i got wallpaper and that's it.  no Unity no old desktop nothin.  I can ssh in, and am wondering how I should go about starting a desktop ? any suggestions ?
 dagon: lol that's cool, i'd be fine with old desktop too
 dagon: right now i can't get anything
 dagon: its set to auto login...how do I get it to logout ?
 dagon: i can ssh in, but the actual console come up to wallpaper and that's it.  I can move the mouse but i get no context menus on right click, nothing but blank wallpaper
 dagon: where is the config file that specifies the desktop or X window manager ? if I can find that file perhaps I can change it and rebot ?
 dagon: ok thanks i'll keep asking and googling
 dagon: lol it sucks but luckily its just my 6 year old computer..she isn't too upset
 dagon: yeah ubuntu is great for kids because of the gui, but to be honest i find that the gui gets in my way...
 dagon: i know that the unity or whatever it is has a config file somewhere...just need to find it and turn it off or revert back to old window manager
 i found an article that says when you have no window manager to right click the dekstop and create a folder then enter the folder to get into the file manager...when i try to do this the context menu flashes reall quickly then disappers...
 ActionParsnip: who said i did not like linux ? i love linux and i like ubuntu is fine for my kids
 edbian: that holding down did not help...by the way the screen flickers i think i have a driver problem...the video card is old but its has 256 MB vram its an old nvidia...im going to try a different video card and see if it helps
 ActionParsnip: actually my kids love it
