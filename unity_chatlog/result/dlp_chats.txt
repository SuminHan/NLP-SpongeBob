 Fuck me this place is busy.
 I've lost my hardware graphics support.
 And encfs doesn't work properly (but then it never did). My hacks have been undone.
 Graphics didn't involve any hacking, so that's worrying :-s
 acicula: It's complicated.
 acicula: You can easily create an encfs filesystem.
 acicula: But do you want to use it for authentication and encrypt the whole home directory?
 acicula: I don't know how it works throught the GUI,
 acicula: I've done it manually.
 acicula: You have to set up pam_encfs
 Yeah?
 ohsix: So what would you suggest?
 acicula: Ignore me then. Apparently I don't know what I'm talking about.
 #
 acicula: Using it for auth *does* cause problems.
 acicula: It can be.
 ohsix: I see.
 oic
 There is a wiki somewhere.
 acicula: Be careful.
 acicula: I had problems with this. encfs has a timeout
 acicula: if it times out while you're logged in, you start getting lots of "Transport endpoint not connected" errors.
 acicula: And it doesn't seem to remount on demand.
 acicula: Possibly waiting for input (which is impoossible since it won't have a controlling term)
 I've got i915 problems.
 ohsix: A lost laptop could easily be an identity fraud bonanza without encrypted filesystems.
 ohsix: No, but it does make that information much more difficult to read.
 ohsix: Even if you don't encrypt swap.
 ohsix: Do you actually want me to calculate the statistics?
 ryanakca: It doesn't look like I'm getting any acceleration.
 ryanakca: I think X is using the wrong driver.
 ohsix: Rubber what?
 oic
 ohsix: Well if they've got my laptop they probably don't know who I am.
 ohsix: Until they've broken the cryptography.
 ohsix: I never said anything about a known adversary.
 ohsix: Shall we take this into #ubuntu-offtopic?
 ohsix: But the adversary does not have infinite time, because in a few years the information will be worthless.
 I know first hand why it's bad. For various reasons.
 ohsix: Unless "they" have developed an efficient interger factorisation algorithm, "they" will not be able to decrypt the information within its valuable lifespan.
 ohsix: Or unless "they" are prepared to come and beat me with a rubber hose for it.
 entity: What does /etc/fstab say?
 entity: Ubuntu 11.04 has probably enumerated the drives differently for some reason... so /dev/sda1 could become /deb/sdb1
 Use UUID's in fstab instead
 entity: When you get the boot menu.
 entity: Remount read-write.
 entity: If your root partition wasn't mounted you wouldn't be able to read /etc/fstab
 Or anything else, for that matter.
 entity: Use blkid to find UUID.
 entity: Replace /dev/sda2 with UUID=... in /etc/fstab
 entity: Make sure it's the right partition!
 entity: And could you paste /proc/mounts as well?
 entity: Yeah.
 xinel: Don't get him started :D
 chotaz: You're in an awkward position.
 chotaz: Depends when the power failed
 chotaz: You could probably recover the filesystem but the software will likely be in an inconsistent state.
 chotaz: I would, probably.
 chotaz: Use a liveCD to do a backup first (if you haven't already).
 chotaz: There's no simple answer to that.
 chotaz: How much RAM you got?
 chotaz: With that much RAM you don't really need swap unless you want to use hibernate.
 chotaz: Or you're running something insanely memory-hungry.
 I usually suggest some as well.
 My machine has 3GB RAM, and used swap is almost always 0.
 chotaz: If Linux runs out of memory it will kill a random process.
 chotaz: That is, when all RAM + swap space has been used.
 in which case malloc() will fail instead.
 :D
 I never use hibernate.
 Only suspend.
 ohsix: Interesting.
 I don't use suspend much either. I don't think my laptop has ever gone into hibernation that way.
 entity: What?
 entity: Make your fstab look like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/600524/
 ohsix: Who?
 entity: Try mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda2 /
 lol
 entity: Good.
 entity: Be careful.
 entity: You reboote3d?
 Um. Ok. That's weird.
 entity: You could run fsck on the drive, *DO NOT DO THIS IF THE FS IS MOUNTED READ-WRITE*
 entity: If you've got a backup the risk is limited.
 entity: And if you don't then a clean install is riskier.
 entity: Then breaking your filesystem with a bad fsck is worth trying.
 Because it won't take as long as a fresh install.
 entity: And the chances are it won't break your filesystem.
 entity: cat /proc/mounts
 entity: then fsck /dev/device-by-uuid/...
 entity: I am assuming the fs is mounted read-only. It's very important that it is.
 Are you sure?
 entity: ^^^
 entity: fsck will print a big fat warning anyway
 entity: If you just rebooted, you should be read only already.
 entity: What did the cat say?
 entity: And what error did you get this time?
 entity: Can you paste the line with /dev/disk/by-uuid on it?
 entity: It's read only, you can fsck it.
 entity: fsck might still complain it's mounted, but just ignore it.
 fsck /dev/disk/by-uuid/87d334b4-9a16-4621-967a-5f74491dd9e4
 entity: What happened?
 entity: Then it should have mounted in the first place.
 entity: Fair enough.
 entity: I'm defeated.
