 hi all, can  i  install the font Arial Narrow on ubuntu or is it just not going to happen?
 taglass: cheers thanks, i thought i read that arial narrow wasn't included in that.
 taglass: hmm, turns out i have both packages up to date
 taglass: do you know will a web page with arial narrow auto degrade to a similar font?
