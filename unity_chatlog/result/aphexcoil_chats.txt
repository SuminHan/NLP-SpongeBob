 hello!
 how's everyone enjoying Unity?
 actually it was a real question ... I'm about to upgrade :)
 you can still use Gnome, right?
 thanks escott
 I upgraded to Beta using the switch to show alpha and beta releases ... hopefully I can go from beta to the real release without any hitches
 are you guys recommending a fresh install?
 all my files are on dropbox, so it isn't a hassle to do a fresh install
 hahaha
 I'm using a PHC edition of the current kernal so that I can undervolt my laptop's CPU ... I'm assuming I'll lose that ability until they can compile something for 11.04
 the undervolting really helps keep the laptop cool
 why can't we add devices to the bar at the top or bottom in unity?  I miss the CPU monitors and weather, etc.
 that defeats the purpose of having Unity
 I'd like Unity to include those things
 lol kusanagi
 I'm just suggesting an enhancement for unity, Rockets
 oh
 you can still use Gnome in 11.04
 Unity is ready for some people ... it's going to take time to adapt to it like any new release
 !classic
 no Window
 you should be able to burn ISOs in the new version
 hey Calif!
 I had to log into a different server
 the other one was too quiet
 lol at apple fanboy
 I loved Apple back in the IIgs era
 Why can't you burn an ISO, Window?
 instead of repeating the same thing over and over, why don't you tell us what the problem is?
 are you trying this under Unity or Gnome, Window?
 it is optional
 it's default, but optional
 we used to always debug in production ... Like Bill O'Reilly said, "F it, we'll do it live!"
 I've been using software since Dos 1.0 ... everyone knows that when you install the latest and greatest, you're part of the debug team
 every time a new version of anything comes out, people are going to bitch about something
 I have a question.  Where can I find a list of minimum hardware requirements for Unity 3D?
