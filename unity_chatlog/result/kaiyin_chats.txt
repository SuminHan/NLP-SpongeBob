 what is the best gui backup tool for ubuntu?
 Will ppa sources conflict with system upgrade?
 ohsix: how do i purge them?
 ohsix: what if i don't remember those names?
 is there a way to purge every ppa source?
 i think a reinstall would be faster than an upgrade.
 i remember there is a backup tool often compared with rsync, having a name that also starts with r, but i've forgotten it.
 could anyone remind me?
 ohsix: thanks. that's it.
 ohsix: why do you like it so much?
 Please have a look at this: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/5906/
  is there any problem with the swap partition?
 is it possible to run ubuntu or xubuntu withou gdm?
  every time i open a file in midnight commander (inside xterm), i.e. reading a pdf file with evince, the application would feedback some info into xterm, and clobber the mc interface. Has anyone ever exprienced this?
 Very annoying. Otherwise i might make mc my main file manager.
