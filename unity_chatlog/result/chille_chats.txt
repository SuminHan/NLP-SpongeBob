 Hello guys! I just switched my workstation from a Mac to a PC with Ubuntu 11.04
 I have most stuff up and running, however i would need some help to find a few applications
 first of all i want some kind of application to monitor cpu temp etc, any ideas?
 conky.. okay..
 ah, sweet, conky does the job perfect
 okay next application on my wantlist list is some kind of password manager. is ther any one like keychain in os x?
 aha.. hmm..
 sweet, KeePassX does the job perfectly. however it would be awesome with better integrations with 3rd party applications, but i guess thats not possible? :o
 what development environment should i take a look at? is Eclipse the most powerful choice for C/C++ and PHP?
 dc5ala: okay
 is there any easy way to configure the shortcuts in Unity?
 for example, i don't want Super+T to open the trash, i want to use it to open a new tab in my terminal
