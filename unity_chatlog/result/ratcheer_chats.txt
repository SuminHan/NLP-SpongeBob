 I just updated to Natty. My main user still runs Firefox 3.6. But, I created a new user and that user runs FF 4. How do I get my primary user to run FF 4 instead of 3.6?
 pooltable: About 2 hours or more.
 Sexygurl2furl: Long Term Support
 pooltable: You are not supposed to.

 AmuletOfNight: No, just update aptitude and safe-upgrade
 I upgraded to Natty and could not run Firefox 4 as my primary user. I uninstalled and reinstalled FF, now I can Start FF with a terminal command (/usr/lib/firefox-4.0/firefox.sh), but the Unity Firefox icon will not start it. How can I reconnect the Unity icon to the app?
 xsinick_laptop: I like Gnome3 much better than Unity. I tried to like Unity, but I couldn't.
 andeeeuk: In what way does it destroy things. I am only having trouble with my Firefox appl icon turning generic.
 andeeeuk: How did you upgrade?
 andeeeuk: Sorry that happened to you. I've upgraded two systems to Gnome3 from PPA with only a couple of small problems.
