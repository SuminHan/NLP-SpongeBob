 Hello
 I installed XP and now when I upfate grub it does not find it. Any ideas?
 *update
 Jordan_U, I'll check
 parker@parker-G60VX:~$ sudo os-prober
 [sudo] password for parker:
 /dev/sda1:Windows Recovery Environment (loader):Windows:chain
 /dev/sda2:Windows 7 (loader):Windows1:chain
 parker@parker-G60VX:~$
 Sorry
 Here's the paste http://paste.ubuntu.com/602538/
 And I tried adding a custom entry with Grub customizer but it doesn't show there either
 Technically it is burg if it makes a difference
 I can try burg-manager. I just find buc a little iffy
 Jordan_U, It works just fine. Neither grub nor burg see XP though
 I like the look
 Jordan_U, Mind if I PM?
 Ok
 Jordan_U, Before I abandon burg I'm going to try burg-manager
 Just a sec
 What and where would I add to this to boot XP from sda3? http://paste.ubuntu.com/602543/
