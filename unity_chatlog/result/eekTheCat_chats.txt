 Would someone kindly reccomend an rss client..
 red2kic, thank you. anyone else with news aggregator reccomendations?
 red2kic, so lifera is what you use regularly? I prefer desktop apps, so that eliminates google reader
 red2kic, liferea is unresponsive right now. it's loading all the default feeds which I was going to delete anyway :(
 Could someone give the value of their errorformat in vim? :set errorformat
 stimpie, thank you. mine seems to be a bit screwy. trying to figure out if it's an ubuntu issue or something I did. :)
 Krishnandu, you probably want to check launchpad for something like that
 every new Ubuntu release seems to have a lot of regressions.
 auToeXeC, depends on what you have installed. it will tell you if you try
 auToeXeC, and give you a chance to abort
 Zahrada, a text editor :-P
 Zahrada, nothing is jumping out at me when I search the repositories. google says a few apps exist, but there don't seem to be official ubuntu packages.
 Ouch, major power regression, I'm definitely not upgrading to natty. http://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=15935
 jeremydei, maybe your hard drive is hosed?
 toggles, it says fix released for "Release Notes" not for Natty itself
 toggles, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NattyNarwhal/ReleaseNotes#Linux%20kernel
 toggles, So I guess that release notes bug was just a reminder to note the problem "Known Issues" section of the release notes.
 blip-, the letter R is a few releases away
 Defusal_, I don't have an answer. But I've found that using emacs style navigation works pretty consistently across shells, terminals, and remote connections. ctrl-p, ctrl-n, ctrl-b, ctrl-f
 Defusal_, what is $TERM when you ssh to that machine
 Defusal_, is that what it is when you ssh to other ubuntu machines?
 Defusal_, maybe that system is missing terminfo for xterm? ls /lib/terminfo/x/xterm*
 Defusal_, Do the emacs style keybindings work? ctrl-p for up, ctrl-n for down, ctrl-f for right, ctrl-b for left
 Defusal_, what is $SHELL on that system?
 Defusal_, that must be your problem
 Defusal_, on a standard ubuntu system it should be /bin/bash
 Defusal_, sh is ancient unix compatibility shell
 Defusal_, odds are it's bash in compatibility mode...
 Defusal_, what does "dpkg -l bash" say?
 Defusal_, So it's installed. Changing a symlink manually like maco suggested is not the right way to change shells
 Defusal_, usermod -s /bin/bash Defusal_
 Defusal_, by Defusal_ i mean whatever your username is :)
 maco, it's slightly safer that mucking about /etc/passwd :)
 wizworks, don't know, but it's probably acpi related..
 wizworks, someting in /etc/acpi maybe?
 studentz, there isn't much reason for an xorg.conf on most modern systems
 studentz, I don't have one
 AgresiV, the command would be find / -name xorg.conf
 lastoflast, i don't know what you mean either. just throwing Amarok out there as another possiblity
