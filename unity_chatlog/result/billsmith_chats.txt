 Does anyone know if changes were made to the 11.4 release just before the announcement?  I have a pre-release version that has problems with intel video.
 The screen is so broken that I can't get to a terminal.
 BTW, have been running SuSE 11.4 and there are boot problems and video problems with that release that have not been evident with previous versions.
 I'll try that again, but recall the previous attempt failed.  Don't recall what happened, so as mentioned, will retest.
 Am just curious if the same problems with SuSE are evident in Ubuntu.  From the comments scolling by, it may have to do with changes in the kernel.
