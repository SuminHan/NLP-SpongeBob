 I'm starting to get really pissed off here
 I am trying to play minecraft, with the .jar provided by the website.  It keeps up and just closing out on me.
 With NO warning.
 just BAM and it's no longer running
 what could be causing this?
 wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwawiohtqawoht
 tsaknorris, that wwwwwww is from it just closing itself agaimn
 tsaknorris, the same way I've been doing it all week, right click and run with openjdk.
 It ran fine for 5 hours tonight
 This started happening after I had to restart with the thing still running, because all the titlebars disappeared
 tsaknorris, i don't start it from command line
 tsaknorris, it's been running fine on open all week
 why is it starting this crap NOW?
 did restarting without closing it out do something?
 okay, hand on here

 do I have the right repositories for getting Sun Java?  http://pastebin.com/cwaDmyTX
 zvacet, done, and doing command, thanies
 thankies
 zvacet, which sun-java-* should I install?  sun-javadb-common, sun-javadb-javadoc, sun-javadb-client, sun-javadb-core, sun-java-demo, or sun-javadb-doc?
 according to that tinyurl in the trigger, sun is not available for 10.10
 Yes, I have openjdk
 I'm being told I need sun to continue running minecraft

 I keep getting zero results for java6
 how interesting
 terminal and synaptic both couldn't find it
 but the link on that page you linked me is getting it installed
 thankies :D
 zvacet, appears so
 zvacet, i'll come back if minecraft keeps closing itself under sunjava
 it usually closes itself after about 5 minutes
 so time will tell, zvacet
 zvacet, did it again
 zvacet, I'll try wiping and re-installing minecraft
 Yeah, I told it to launch with sun
 Yeah, I told it to launch with sun @ zvacet*
 zvacet, me either
 I'm trying a fresh install of it
