 where is the main premissions file located on ubuntu 10.04
 Im looking for the file that holds all of the premissions  and or user group info
 usr13,  says it dosnt exsist
 I need to find an informative doc on how to work the user accs / groups ...
 What is the difference between the file "group" and "group-"
 im guessing the one with the - is a backup?
 it goes live the 20 sometime
 the 28***
 Would it matter if i edit the group file  to display eachgroup on a diff line ?
 hmm weird  i DLed the file from my server to look at it
 and everything is on 1 line
 usr13, notepad
 Im guessing that when im viewing the group  doc that if there isnt a usr/acc type beside a group it isnt in use?
 hammer
 ?
 escott, aah true
 should i be making say a user called WEB for my web stuff and adding the group "www-data" to it ?
