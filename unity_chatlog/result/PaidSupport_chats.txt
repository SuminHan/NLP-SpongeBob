 Would paying Canonical for support help me if the issue was in the kernel?
 kk
 Gnea: Because I'm new to linux. Don't know who the kernel people are
 Gnea: I'm not. Just a home user with a laptop that the new kernel breaks
 Gnea: Oh, I'm more than willing to do whatever it takes to get the bugs fixed. I'll type anything, and break anything, if the end result is a working linux laptop
 Gnea: It's an acpi backlight issue. I've brought it up here a few times, but no one has any ideas
 Gnea: Gateway NV78. Ran 10.10 with 2.6.35 for a few days, all was good. Upgraded to 11.04 with 2.6.38 and I no longer have a backlight
 Gnea: Did a reformat and reinstall from the iso (on CD). Same problems
 Gnea: Nope. Only way I can see the screen at all is with a flashlight pointed at it
 acicula: Nope. Fn keys didn't work in 10.10 at all, but I had a backlight. After the upgrade I lose even that.
 acicula: I am positive the backlight is completly off. The only way to get it to work is with a nomodeset grub option, but that destroys my support for unity, and for anything over 1024x768
 rcmaehl: I did not.
 escott: after upgrading to 11.04 I lose /sys/class/backlight   It isn't there
 Jordan_U: Intel Mobile Express 4, not nvidia
 escott: after fresh installing I lost the old kernel. Only have 2.6.38 installed
 Jordan_U: Haven't tried the liveCD. Though I do know it works with the alternate installer (up until I reboot). Lose backlight after grub
 Gnea: Correct
 Gnea: Also correct.
 Gnea: I know of two other NV78 laptop users with the same issue.
 Gnea: I was really looking forward to migrating my network away from windows =\
 escott: sadly, as a very new user, I would have no idea where to begin
 Gnea: I figured if I was going to learn it from scratch, I may as well do it with the newest version, as Unity looks awesome (from what I can see by flashlight)
 escott: would installing the 10.10 iso be the easiest way to do that?
 escott: intel graphics, yes. And sorry to be such a noob, but can unity run on the older kernel?
 Exactly. Just 2.6.38 right now
 64
 escott: I have not tried installing from the 32 bit, though I have the CD. Would that change anything?
 escott: appreciate all the help
 escott: ok, got that downloaded and copied to my linux partition. Is there a command to install it?
 escott: alrighty. Taking off to give this a shot.
 ?
 escott: I'm still here
 escott: If you can get me prepared, I'll test anything.
 escott: Ok, have those all downloaded
 so just type that in terminal when I'm in the right folder?
 can do
 escott: You still around?
 escott: The install went flawlessly. Upgraded to 2.6.39. Still no backlight
 escott: saved the output from everything I did in case it was important
 escott: That's one more solution tried
 escott: so back to 2.6.35?
 escott: could be 37, not sure. I know 10.10 was running 35 I think
 escott: Alrighty. Downloading the three for .35. I'll give that a shot.
 escott: I am. trying to figure out what a header file is
 escott: Only found just the one .deb at that link
 escott: ok, I'll be back
 I'm on natty this time =)
 Escott: Running 2.6.35 and I have a backlight, and unity
 escott: so, about that header file thing you were talking about. Is that something I need to do?
 escott: where can I find the kernel team?
 escott: sounds like an adventure.
 Will do
 escott: thanks again!
