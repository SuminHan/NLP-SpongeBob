 I have just downloaded ubuntu desktop iso. I created a bootable USB with it. However, when booting it, I get error: ubentry1: file not found
 How do I fix this?
 What should the md5sum of the desktop iso be?

 IdleOne, when I boot it from a USB it gives me the error: ubnentry1: file not found
 What to do?

 Where do I get the netbook iso?
