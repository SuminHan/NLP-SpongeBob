 Does the Unity interface have a built-in way to enable desktop/visual effects like you could with the GNOME interface?
 I did something, and now Windows + A and Windows + F key combinations don't open Find Applications/Find Files anymore.

 For example, I cannot use Firefox's back and forward buttons.
 conorhogan: You can upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04.
 conorhogan: Just boot from the DVD and the setup will give you the option to either wipe your existing 10.10 install before you install or just upgrade it to 11.04.
 Does anyone else have the issue that the launcher area cannot be used by other applications? Like there is an overlay which won't let you click through?
 Yes.
