 Hey all. I'm out in New Zealand and it's the 28th, how do I get from Mav to Natty?
 rww: But it's supposed to be out today yeah?
 sweet, anyone know where a countdown is
 dammit, I was hoping to get an hour or two down time while I upgrade. Gah, will have to get back to work
 Is upgrding using the update-manager -d risky? like it will use the same repo yeah?

 bazhang: how do I change to a different Mirror. I was hoping to get from a NZ one if possible
 HELPP!!!!  I can't upgrade, it just dies but here's the result from my sudo do-release-upgrade. http://paste.ubuntu.com/601236/
 doesn't dreamhost use some ubuntu?
 Incarus6: ty, will post
 Incarus6: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601238/ please help. I had only just switched to the fastest mirror which was near-by
 Incarus6: it's more than I can fit in my bash window. How can I save it to a file for pasting
 Incarus6: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601253/ thanks for looking into this eh
 Incarus6: I have installed and uninstalled as you mentioned. What should I do next?
 Incarus6: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601255/  have uninstalled all those packages
 Incarus6: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601259/ cheers
 Incarus6: Awesome, thanks, your a credit to this OS
 Incarus6: I'm in the middle of a upgrade which is caluclating changes, can I still do what you mentioned safely?
 Incarus6: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601263/
 Incarus6: It still fails the same :(
 Incarus6: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601266/
 Incarus6: ah, should it not ignore it as a 3rd party app?
 Incarus6: Is it not normal to have non standard packages installed? I don't understand why my system is having issues, Just want to try 11.
 Incarus6: Does that mean I can just untick the repos and update before trying upgrade or do I need to uninstall anything not from official repos?
 sweet
 man, if thats all thats' stopped I will be pissed, the upgrader says it does it for you
 Incarus6: it's calulating changes still :|
 Incarus6: Nope, hmm, is it possible to upgrade from mav? what could have I done to make it so impossible?
 Incarus6: nope, still fails
 Incarus6: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601281/ thanks for sticking about man
 yep
 Incarus6: yeah, on sat night, sad huh
 Incarus6: or is that leet? ;)
 Incarus6: sweeet
 Incarus6: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601293/ If I remove that lib you menitoned I lose about 1gb of apps. So I didn't
 Incarus6: Does this mean I really have to uninstall all those apps?
 Incarus6: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601296/ should I hit yes or no?
 Incarus6: ok, now I'm confused
 I don't mind if I have to drop some apps and reinstall. I just need to make sure I get to a stable state for work
 Incarus6: thats why I not worried if I have to drop them, you reckon I should just drop the GB and pick it up on the other side?
 Incarus6: what a nigtmare
 a mirror at a university here in NZ? surely that would be ok
 Incarus6:   a mirror at a university here in NZ? surely that would be ok
 Incarus6: it doesn't output?
 Incarus6: phew
 Incarus6: I tried removing and reinstalling where needed to all those files with no thirdparty repos available. Trying upgrade again now
 Incarus6: will do if it fails
 Incarus6: still fails, need sleep though so will try again tomorrow maybe. thanks
 I'm upgrading to Natty, should I keep my own debconf or go with package maintainers one??
 should you when updating generally stick with your own or go with maintainers when asked during upgrade process???
