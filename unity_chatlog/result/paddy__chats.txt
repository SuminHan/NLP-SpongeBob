 I have an i7 processor which is not loaded much at all during disk writes but my 3-disk raid-5 array write speed is 30mb's whereas its read is 2oomb's
 _ruben even with a fast processor?
 _ruben how so, is it their seek time?
 greentea: FANTASTIC
 oh you must disable twinview before uppgrading if you are using it
 bangLUCE: if you do not have root permissions you cant
 _ruben what can i do increase the speed?
 _ruben, so if i add another disk to the raid 5 array it will be faster on the writes?
 mbrochh: i have tried that for hours and could not get it to work
 Psychobudgie: whats not to like?
 _ruben i have a ssd can i use that as  a cache,  how do i use a cache?
 _ruben: what about lvm
 what is the best way to use a ssd as a raid 5 cache?
 _ruben: do you think i should buy an other disk and switch to raid10?
 dualscreen unity works really well
 bencc yes
 bencc there is a package that lets you
 bencc search for unity 2d in software center
 To everyone who has had difficulty using dual monitors! You must not use twinview, it will make compiz segfault
 Soothsayer: backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf then delete it, log in again
 Soothsayer: install them, if it does not work do what i said befire
 Soothsayer: try and find an option to enable it
