 odd... why would I need 2G for a USB thumbdrive under Ubuntu when if I create the same one on Windows it only needs 1g (to make the same said USB thumbdrive system)
 odd...  so on Unity I have to have an icon ON the desktop as well as ON the launcher?  that's ridiculous.
 FunnyLookinHat: how can I add a launcher to the panel in unity WITHOUT adding it to the desktop first.  And, giving it a custom icon on the panel.
 FunnyLookinHat: cause when I remove it from the desktop, it goes away from the panel.
 FunnyLookinHat: odd... I only get "keep in Launcher" when I right click
 FunnyLookinHat: lol
 FunnyLookinHat: yeah it's a fix... but.... sheesh... I hope Miguel didn't make these Gnome3 decisions  or I'll have to beat him and Nat.
 FunnyLookinHat: seriously though, I appreciate the need for something new and flashy, but I'm not so sure why we had to push this alpha software out with 11.04
 anyway :(
 FunnyLookinHat: I may try though...   I do like you, in spite of your funny hat.
 FunnyLookinHat: thanks for the hack work-around, I thought of that but felt very dirty to even try it.  lol
 I've been using Linux for a long time, what 95?  And well... I've never seen as silly of a move as this in a major distro for the default UI.
