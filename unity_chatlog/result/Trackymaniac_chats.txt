 Hi
 anyone care to help? I can't pick "Ubuntu Netbook edition" in the windows Wubi installer. The version is 11.04. Anyone have time? thx
 No netbook edition of the 11.04.. or?
 thank you Buddhacz.. hadn't noticed
 Buddhacz the problem is that the 11.04 runs pretty slowly on my netbook..
 which newest version is sans unity?
 ok Buddhacz, good to know. Just to clarify: does the 10.04 LTS download on the ubuntu website allow for me to pick the "netbook edition" from the wubi installer?
