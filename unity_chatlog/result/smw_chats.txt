 It is 1:54PM in china
 theGreatDane, troll. (anything not bashing windows is trolling)
 aroman, if you ever figure it out let me know. I want to kill HP so badly
 aroman, I have gotten used to it overtime...
 aroman, apparently "no one uses the function keys"
 aroman, agreed
 BarbaraBush, when it happens, it happens
 I came up with a good idea to beet the fact that all the apt mirrors will be overloaded. I will setup an ec2 instance with apt-cacher and download from the ubuntu ec2 mirror. What are the chances the ec2 mirror will be overloaded?
 beat*
 AustinWolfclaw, yeah, but you still can't install other packages
 AustinWolfclaw, but do you plan to install anything?
 AustinWolfclaw, the mirrors slow to a crawl
 aroman, what you really need is something that makes the fn key always pressed
 aroman, when you press the fn key, it should then be un-fn
 aroman, yeah
 aroman, I am thinking of how caps lock works
 AustinWolfclaw, correct
 !ask | Spaz_Dynamic
 any AustinWolfclaw can you see why torrent does not help? What they need is to have apt use torrents!
 Spaz_Dynamic, ok, not very funny though... I was kind of excited
 ayecee, but it is not in general use...
 Spaz_Dynamic, ok
 ouyes, this can't be determined
 aroman, if you do it, let me know!
 ouyes, one googol (10^100)
 Spaz_Dynamic, I would say not. If I really wanted to put work into it, I would get the alternative install cds and combine them
 Spaz_Dynamic, I know very little about ubuntu's usb thing. Does it run a iso in loopback?
 Spaz_Dynamic, for combining them, you get the alternative install cds, you look at the "pool" directory, and you combine them (they have the same file structure, some files are the same)
 Spaz_Dynamic, you then need to put all the preseed files in (with different names) and make menu entries
 Spaz_Dynamic, It is not easy, however, you will learn alot about the debian installer and automated installs ;-)
 forceflow, on the main page there is a link to the beta
 buhman1, it is not the 28th in California!
 forceflow, buhman1, "Ubuntu 11.04 release is scheduled somewhere in the time period when it's April 28th somewhere in the world, not at a specific time"
 dani_,  "Ubuntu 11.04 release is scheduled somewhere in the time period when it's April 28th somewhere in the world, not at a specific time"
 Spaz_Dynamic, we are both correct
 Spaz_Dynamic, in 24hours and 40minutes it will not be April 28th anywhere
 Spaz_Dynamic, not in 24hours and 40 minutes
 Spaz_Dynamic, maybe, I don't know hawaii, I thought they were PST
 Spaz_Dynamic, I am east coast too
 Spaz_Dynamic, because lubuntu is lxde which is hard to use?
 Spaz_Dynamic, Well, it is too simple
 Spaz_Dynamic, not specifically hard
 Spaz_Dynamic, I am not saying that makes it bad. It makes it the opposite of ubuntu
 tuckaway, is it just a simple desktop install? There is little to secure.
 tuckaway, what do you mean "secure". What types of attacks are you afraid of?
 tuckaway, what would you do to "secure" windows? What types of attacks do you fear?
 tuckaway, those are not run by default
 tuckaway, I don't even think those are installed by default
 tuckaway, if you were making a kiosk or something where you are afraid of people with physical access, there is alot to do.
 tuckaway, yes, probably. For public computers, it is way to easy to gain root if you have physical access.
 tuckaway, so a school, internet kiosk, etc, would need some work.
 lwizardl, "Ubuntu 11.04 release is scheduled somewhere in the time period when it's April 28th somewhere in the world, not at a specific time"
 rww, can I have that as a bot cmd?
 that would be sweet :-)
 tsimpson, yep. Still you have got to admit that would be a nice factoid :-P
 tsimpson, fine, I will keep it in my clipboard
 vibhav, it is under the server configuration
 vibhav, server -> network list -> choose a server -> edit
 vibhav, it is the "connect command"
 DirtyDawg, then they can stop splitting their attention and just help in #ubuntu
 vibhav, stream what?
 sobersabre, as in when it is not running in the gui?
 sobersabre, that needs to be fixed in grub
 sobersabre, add the option vga=??? where ??? is a 3 digit number representing your display
 vibhav, I know littel about that
 sobersabre, that is the only way I know how and I have done it many times
 horse_play, "Ubuntu 11.04 release is scheduled somewhere in the time period when it's April 28th somewhere in the world, not at a specific time."
 soreau, um, it has always worked for me...
 horse_play, read my quote
 sobersabre, yes
 soreau, yours looked better anyways
 soreau, much better than a random 3 digit number
 proq, lmao
 DirtyDawg, one day. X must die
 elzoog, "Ubuntu 11.04 release is scheduled somewhere in the time period when it's April 28th somewhere in the world, not at a specific time."
 kaatta, /etc/apt/sources.list
 robert05ad, you mean vim?
 kaatta, that is the file location
 kaatta, sudo nano -w /etc/apt/sources.list
 then ctrl O to save and ctrl x to exit
 kaatta, ^
 kaatta, nano is easier to use than vi
 Rziz, why do you want a cli install?
 nyquist333, where is that file?
 trailoryo, I suggest you set the server password to trailoryo:xxxxxxx
 trailoryo, that can be done by clicking on freenode in the list. and then clicking edit
 trailoryo, np
 FoolsRun, export DISPLAY=':0'
 FoolsRun, yes, it is a command
 FoolsRun, different line
 FoolsRun, or export xyz; java -jar x.jar
 FoolsRun, are you the same user?
 FoolsRun, the same user as the person who is logged in
 FoolsRun, if you are not the same user, I don't think it works. I know very little about x
 FoolsRun, in the past without doing anything I have run stuff by setting DISPLAY as the same user who was logged in
 FoolsRun, I don't know the answer then.
 FoolsRun, It works when I try to run firefox
 l3, try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
 l3, you removed all your kernels and it started removing everything else, right?
 l3, the ubuntu-desktop package should have everything you need.
 l3, are you sure?
 l3, do sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop. Then, do sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
 kalib, do sudo apt-get update and pastebin the results
 !pastebin > kalib
 [snake], downgrading is not supported
 [snake], it is actually very easy... if you are doing a reinstall. Otherwise, I would call it impossible.
 [snake], only attempt if you think it would be fun to learn everything about the internals of ubuntu and want to try the impossible ;-)
 [snake], I don't know of any user account linker thing...
 [snake], yeah. I have a better idea.
 [snake], backup /home, reinstall, restore /home
 kalib, I do not speak your language ;-)
 [snake], I still have not updated to 11.04 ;-)
 [snake], That is good to know. My opinion is that ubuntu needs to choose between "just working" and being on the "bleeding-edge". That used to be the same thing ;-)
