 Right now, in Ubuntu 11.04 (with Unity), I have to hover over the top menu bar before the menu options appear, overlaying the title. Is there a way to get them to be there all the time, without my mouse hover?
 Ah, I missed it Dr_Willis. Can you link me once more?
 Thanks, Dr_Willis. :)
 Dr_Willis, I find that's true with Chromium. :\
 Firefox plays quite nicely, but not Chrome. I'll get around to fixing it someday, but for now I'll use Firefox because of it.
 Dr_Willis, I don't want to uninstall Global Menu completely. I just want to make it so that it's set the menu never hides. So that I don't have to bring my cursor up there before the menu shows up. Do you know how to do that?
 Right now the window title shows constantly, and the menu doesn't come up until my cursor's there.
