 what's the difference between mutt and mixmaster.  FYI only my 2nd week on IRC
 is there something like mutt and mixmaster for emacs?
 is there a solid program that i can run in emacs to send anonymous email?
 [4-tea-2]: i suppose you are right, but there are ways to anonymize your email.
 botcity: what is 10minitemail
 [4-tea-2]: yeah, mixmaster is a pain in the rear.  i do not use vi/vim either.  prefer to use emacs
 botcity: that website is useless
 what is considered to be the best email client for ubuntu

 tensorpudding: i am not looking to "poll". looking for possibilities.  what is out there?
 ubottu: how do i communicate with a bot?
 bazhang: good suggestion. thanks
 bazhang: i am a bit confused with these "bots"
 how do i get evolution to show in the system tray
 xangua: i do not understand what you are saying
 xangua: are you saying by default it is in the system tray.  i do not see an envelope on the right corner
 xangua: any ideas?
 yes
 bazhang: no. sorry. i mean the "notification area"
 bazhang: when you run xchat or whatever it automatically docks in the "notification area"
 is there a user friendly equation editor in ubuntu to input discrete math or calculus HW
 LAcan: thank you for your response.  could you please expound on that.
 LAcan: you are the man.  how about learning functionality?  is there a good guidebook or tutorial?
 LAcan: would prefer not to hop around google trying to find what i need for the next 30 min.  the last equation editor i used was in Microsoft Windows.  not quite ready to make the full jump to latex, but would like to transition smoothly.
 i would like to do my discrete math HW with an equation editor.  i really do not know where to start. openoffice appears not to have the necessary symbols, perhaps i am ignorant of what it has.  would really appreciate assistance.
 nemo: thanks for the suggestions.  mathjax appears to be for someone putting equations on the internet.
 nemo: correct me if i am wrong
 is there something like firemath that is in openoffice or any other program in the ubuntu repository
 nemo: exactly what i needed -> firemath
 nemo: how can i convert the text from firemath to latex?
 nemo: exactly.  why?  b/c i want to jump on the latex bandwagon so i can feel self-important (joking).  what do you mean exact opposite goal?
 nemo: i see. so why would anyone care to use latex
 nemo: there were editors to support it?  what do you mean?  sorry for needing a history lesson.
 nemo: is there something like mathml that is built-in for openoffice, emacs, vim, or any other program that does not require a web browser?
 nemo: i understand that mathml is xml, just not sure how to use that in another program.  also, i am reading http://www.mathweb.org/wiki/LaTeX and am not really sure where to begin.  some of the english links hit documents in german.
 nemo: i do not see anything about mathml at http://www.mathweb.org/wiki/LaTeX
 nemo: this is my 2nd or 3rd week on IRC.  i appreciate your patience.
