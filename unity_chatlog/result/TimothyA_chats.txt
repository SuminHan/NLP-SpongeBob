 how do I stop the shell from flashing when I'm press tab for filename-completion and there are alternative spellings?
 How do I stop ubuntu trigger seizures in people?
 I would like to have Ubuntu stop triggering a seizure on anyone who comes within viewing range -_-
 KM0201: then what?
 partial filename + tab = seizure-triggering blink
 I wish to disable the seizure-triggering link
 *blink
 KM0201: I'm serious here, bash is giving me a headache and making me temporarily blind whenever I tab for file completion
 sipior: I have... it's still blinking
