 Camer0n,  just open the case and look at the network card.
 or just look at the card
 should have make and model
 i see.
 Realtek RTL8187SE Wireless LAN ** - that is the wireless card
 Realtek RTL8102E (Onboard) is the lan card
 its the regular ethernet card.
 not for wireless.
 the one you plug the cable into
 the ethernet cable
 Lillymon,  look into lubuntu for that system with 512mb.
 its a lightweight alternative.
 honestly, i tried running ubuntu 11.04 on my p4 3.0g 1.2g of ram, and it ran TERRIBLE
 lubuntu runs like a deram.
 jibadeeha,  maybe.
 Simkin,  Yeah,  it was bearable but still slow.
 jibadeeha,  integrated intel chipset, cant think of the exact model off hand
 jibadeeha,  it ran terrible though. Even with classic mode withno effects!
 but, lubuntu has saved me. I love it.
 Ubuntu was 90% of the time using 100% cpu
 test
 .
 what graphics card?
