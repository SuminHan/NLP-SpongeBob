 hi
 how can i set unity as my default desktop?
 choosing "Ubuntu" from gdm combobox doesn't work
 velcroshooz, only if you have 3d acceleration, which i didn't because nvidia drivers were not working
 i have 3 options, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Classic and Ubuntu Classic (no effects)
 i was using the "no effects" option because nvidia drivers were not working, the package was broken in the repository
 i was able to install nvidia-173 package today and got 3d working but if i choose the default desktop, it goes to the classic, and not unity
 how can i set unity as default by hand?
 jaredquinn, doesn't work, there must be a way to defined it somewhere in a file
 jaredquinn, but they are working properly because i can run unity from the terminal and it works perfectly
 jaredquinn, maybe there is a key in gconf that defines the default desktop, do you have any idea?
 jaredquinn, i've found the problem, i had "exec metacity --replace" in my .xinitrc because unity was not working
 jaredquinn, i'll just delete my .xinitrc
 jaredquinn, thanks ;) (let me try it)
 jaredquinn, didn't work, i've also deleted .dmrc and didn't work
 jaredquinn, what do you have in your .dmrc? i have "session=gnome"
 jaredquinn, i'll try deleting the session=gnome then
