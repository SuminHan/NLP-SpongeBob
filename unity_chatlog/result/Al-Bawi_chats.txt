 hi there , i have a problem upgrading from 10.10 to 11.04 , it says The upgrade has aborted. Please check your Internet connection or installation media and try again. All files downloaded so far are kept.
 Dr_Willis , you mean that i should try any time later?
 is there a problem with the server for upgrading ?
 can i upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 by using the CD , because i dont want to erase my current documents and games in 10.10
