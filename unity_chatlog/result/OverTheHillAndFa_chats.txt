 ehm... i used the prerelease for a while with unity-2d in lack of a working graphical driver. now i got one working. so i started to use unity-3d. but the 2d menu bar overlayed the 3d. actually two bars loaded. so i uninstalled all unity-2d packages and reinstalled unity-3d. but i am not able to get i loaded from the login screen.... help?
 unity will not load at login... how to fix? it starts fine from terminal
 narwhaller: probably a driverproblem if you have a clean install
 narwhaller: if there is more than one proprietary driver in the list try another one
 anyone able to help out with unity not loading? drivers is ok. but standard session does not load unity after uninstalling unity-2d
 is there a unity guru here?
 i uninstalled unity-2d and reinstalled standard unity. now it will not load from login. only from terminal
 nope
 funny no one in the ayatana channel did not suggest that?
 hyptech: seems like it might work. will do a reboot soon
 hyptech: now it just says: Setting Update "run_key" in terminal. should i just wait?
 hyptech: ok, thanks :)
