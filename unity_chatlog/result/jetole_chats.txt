 Hey guys. I just upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 and I don't know if I am in unity or gnome3 but does anyone know how I can revert to gnome2 / the gnome I had before the upgrade?
 freaky[t]: thanks. Let me try
 freaky[t]: thank god that did the trick
 linuasus6: see freaky[t]'s comment
 freaky[t]: seriously. That freaked me out. I knew ubuntu was moving to unity but I kind of didn't expect a change on upgrades
 abhinav: thats fascinating not that I asked
 I don't get it. freaky[t] answered my question followed by two people who seem to think it couldn't be done. weird
 Inphernal: run this and tell me if you get results: dpkg --get-selections | sed -e '/hold$/!d'
 Inphernal: well that was just checking for any packages on your system which may have had a hold on them so if nothing then I don't know what the next step would be to debug it
 Inphernal: on the other hand, you would have got one line for every package with a hold so we would have known what to remove the hold from but since you got nothing then not sure
 Name141: for 11.04 it's nvidia-current but I would install the binary from nvidia. Ubuntu is always behind on the latest nvidia driver
 Inphernal: and neither am I so good luck and hope someone else has a... wait, ppa, I thought you meant ppc for a sec, no I don't think that would be it. third party repos are automatically disabled during the upgrade
 Inphernal: meaning ppa's are automatially disabled during the upgrade
 Name141: what I meant is I wouldn't install it from the repos if I were you since ubuntu usually doesn't have the latest. go to nvidia.com and download the linux driver. If you really want to install it from the repos which is the ubuntu version then type: sudo apt-get install nvidia-common
 Inphernal: keep in mind we have determined two things. It isn't a package on hold and it isn't a ppa. At least you're narrowing the list of what it could be
 Guest29994: what?
 vultraz: because it was just released
 vultraz: if you want stable your best bet is 10.04.02
 vultraz: 10.04 is stable. 11.04 is not devel.
 vultraz: long story short I don't care if you like 10.04 or not. You asked for stable
 vultraz: and if you like the dev version then expect it to be unstable
 11.04 is a final release / not a dev version but it's also very new. It has passed beta and all the RC but I bet in the next 18 months of it's life it will receive thousands of patches
 vultraz: so now you know why it's not "stable"
 vultraz: I run 10.04 on all of the servers I manage, on my home desktop and on my laptop and am running, as of 20 minutes ago 11.04 on my office workstation. 10.04 is pretty damned good IMHO and only a idiot would run 10.10, 11.04 or 11.10 on a server
 vultraz: 10.04 is LTS or long term support release which comes out every two years and is designed to be stable from the ground up. The downside is it doesn't always have the latest software
 I'm going for a smoke. be back in 10
 celthunder: no packages are being held. I already made him do a check
 celthunder: As far as I helped was I made him check for held packages (dpkg --get-selections | sed -e '/\thold$/!d') and confirmed that PPA was not the issue since upgrade disabled third party repos when you upgrade
 celthunder: and that's as involved as I got
 celthunder: np
 JoseeAntonioR: if you are using /etc/X11/xorg.conf then you can edit that file. Ubuntu also has another means for configuring this but I don't know what it is since I use a pretty custom xorg.conf myself
 celthunder: rmmod shouldn't apply. In order for the card to use it, part of X has to invoke it which means it should be reloaded next time he starts X
 celthunder: for example if I have Nouvou listed in xorg.conf then it will load that driver each time I start X
 celthunder: nah X needs the driver when it starts. You can't really change the driver mid session
 JoseeAntonioR: well this isn't one of them. lol
 JoseeAntonioR: http://goo.gl/72RPO
 JoseeAntonioR: the module is nouveau but blacklisting probably won't help either. Sorry celthunder. I'm not trying to step on your feet here
 celthunder: the problem is that X thinks it should use this driver so we need for X to think it should use the proper one
 JoseeAntonioR: run: sudo lspci
 JoseeAntonioR: then put that on pastebin.com and send me the link
 JoseeAntonioR: xorg.conf works in 11.04. I am using it now
 xorg.conf should always work and should always be the over ride afaik
 JoseeAntonioR: sudo lspci -n | sed -e '/00:02\.0/!d'
 then paste that one line
 abhinav_: yes I do and it's usually not easy
 JoseeAntonioR: sudo lsmod | grep -e 'i[89]'
 JoseeAntonioR: sudo modprobe i810
 JoseeAntonioR: just tell me if it gives you an error or anything
 celthunder: I must have missed that part as I was looking into his problem. JoseeAntonioR so you're problem is resolved?
 ohsix: yeah I have read that his card is i810 and I have also read that there are a list of issues with i810
 JoseeAntonioR: you can try
 celthunder: thats an option but I don't think it applies though I could be wrong
