 Eathuz, whats the error message displayed?
 Captainkrtek, sure you can... bad bios flash
 Eathuz, is the usb device plugged into a front or rear port?
 Eathuz, no problem... sorry i couldnt help, though it may be a bios bug you may want to try updating, i cant think of any other reason if it worked fine on another box
