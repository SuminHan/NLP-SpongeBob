 Hello. Is it normal for the upgrade to 11.04 to download files at a speed slower than my connectivity is capable of?
 bazhang ah i see. it's because the servers are being flooded with requests? Okay got it. Thanks.
 I'm part way through my distribution upgrade... if i change the source server, do i have to cancel and run the upgrade again?

 lol wow! this upgrade is gonna take a atleast several hours for me. :) I think I'm gonna postpone it.
 I'm just so excited to try out this new release...
 efox29 was it worth it?

 tanath i did that... still slow.
 i live in hawaii... everything will be slow from here. :D
 efox29 i see.

 tomtit isn't it available?
 tomtit oh, nvm... u said xubuntu...
 i officially cancelled my upgrade. :D i mean officially postponed!
 feels like the right thing to do.
 I got an issue with the new ubuntu... I can't get into the gui. The new bar on the left keeps blinking as if it's constantly reloading. Is this a known bug? Any body know of a fix?
 anyway to revert my 11.04 upgrade back to 10.10??
 it's becoming more like windows and mac... using up alot of resources..
 i'll check it out action.
 i need gui for exam week. shiet...
 i shouldn't have upgraded yet...
 something to do with my video settings... got an issue with loading up gnome properly.
 ActionParsnip i upgraded from 10.10... i don't wanna just clean install.. I got data on here.
 i'm trying to make that my last resort.
 if only i configured those...
 ActionParsnip u mean put a new clean install on a separate partition?
 ActionParsnip i'll try what you're saying... i have no backups setup though...
 ActionParsnip does ubuntu have a backup process in the installation?
 naike :D I wish I was more responsible.
 lol
 Lcawte, u and I are on the same boat!
 I bet there have been a ton of graphics related issues yea? With the whole unity thing and docky crap.
