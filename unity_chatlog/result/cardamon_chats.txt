 Whelp, switching to 10.10 (11.04 lol) broke things.  I've got an invisible menu bar. I couldn't even get a terminal up, I had to come to you in a vterm. I suspect compositing.
 aj00200: alt-f2 isn't responding.
 Just ran the Natty Narwhal upgrade widget.  I've got an invisible menubar up top.  It's semi responsive, but I can't access any applications.  I can't even get a term up and alt-f2 isn't giving me a run menu.  I could use some help fixing it.  I suspect compositing might be an issue.  I usually disable it because this netbook is quite slow and the intel 945GMA doesn't like it.
 aj00200: No. I moved to Narwhal.
 aj00200: I don't know what.  Whatever's default.
 I heard it was switching to Unity, but at no point have I been given an option to make a switch.
 I was running Lucid, the thing told me an upgrade was available, I had time so I ran it.
 aj00200: Is it listed as something else? My options are Ubuntu, Ubuntu Classic, Ubuntu Classic (No Effects)...
 aj00200: That worked.
 How to configure Unity? If I can get compositing off it may work.
 plummerb: It's not.
 A lot of us seem to be experiencing bugs.
 Anyone know way to configure unity when running Ubuntu Classic?
 robin0800: I mean that in Unity, I've got invisible menus and can't find anything to run or configure anything.  I'd like to fix it.  I'm in classic pre-Unity gnome at the moment.
 robin0800: Probably.  I don't use compositing anyway.  My intel 945GMA doesn't like it.
 So I want to turn it off and I need to find where it is.
 robin0800: So what?
 Anyone know how I would switch from Unity 3D to Unity 2D?
 Need to switch from Unity3D to Unity2D. Already installed the packages, but it hasn't altered my login options, which remain Ubuntu, Ubuntu Classic, Ubuntu Classic (No Effects), etc.
 Unity 3D uses a lot of compositing which my two year old netbook's Intel 945GMA hates.
 truepurple: Dual, not Duel.
 Need to switch from Unity3D to Unity2D. Already installed the packages, but it hasn't altered my login options, which remain Ubuntu, Ubuntu Classic, Ubuntu Classic (No Effects), etc.
 Why should I have to do that?
 Still need a way to switch from Unity3D to Unity2D.  Already grabbed the packages.
