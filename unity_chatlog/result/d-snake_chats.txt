 Chipzzz: I don't mean the Unity Menu. I meant the global menu in the panel. I don't want to have main menu of gimp (just gimp) in the panel
 ciphergoth: just right click in the worspace switcher in the bottom panel. there you can configure the rows and cols
 ciphergoth: You use Natty with Unity? Then open a terminal > type in
 sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
 This will install a program to configure it. After this you search in the application menu for "compiz". There you will see the new program. Click on "General options" > switch to the last tab "Desktop size".
 ciphergoth: No problem :-)
 ciphergoth: in the old ubuntu (or Ubuntu Classic) you can do it as I described at first
 ciphergoth: Unity is not complete at the moment. It is very new software
 ciphergoth: Well, I think Unity is not perfect in the moment, but I'm sure it becomes much better in next months.
 snikker: It was removed since Karmic, I think ;-). But you can create one
 Opium56: But you see then the login screen? Whats your grafic card?
 snikker: Cause it will configure automaticly by ubuntu. For indiviual settings you can create one
