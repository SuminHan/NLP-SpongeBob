 karlo: it has, they haven't updated the site but the torrents work
 tsimpson: ? how do you figure
 main website has changed to reflect 11.04
 galumph: ? no it's updated, perhaps your cache is off, shift f5
 [Soma]: I agree
 hey guys, I just installed Natty and upon attempting to connect to the wireless it's asking for me to unlock the default keyring.  It's not the password I created on install and leaving it blank doesn't work either. I'm not using autologin which reportedly would create this prompt in order to create a password. Unfortunately I'm woefully lacking knowledge of the keyring system
 Soothsayer: should be
 arand: thanks I'll give it a try
 ImperialXT: I heard there's a PPA if you want to try that, I have no experience with it though
 ubuntutryout777: that's typical of the live cd, I'm not sure if you can force enable them, but after install unity and the like worked just fine
 ubuntutryout777: after I installed on the harddrive, it's on the iso but I don't think it's enabled during livecd runs
 Furry: yes, if you find the application via the unity search you should be able to drag and drop it onto the side there
