 I get lost with the differences in Ubuntu sometimes becaue Im so used to Red hat based distros
 hi all, have an ubuntu box that keeps respawning basically tty1 seems to be crashing and constantly respawning anyone got any ideas Im flumoxed
 oops forgot to mention thats when you try to login single user works fine
 sorry Squall5668 forgot to mention thats when trying to login when it tries to authenticate the user tty1 dies and respawns its an 8.04 server (not mine)
 sorry Squall5668 single user logins in fine the permissions on dev/tty1 look fine and the script in /etc/events.d/tty1 looks fine also
 sorry Squall5668 single user is recovery mode
 sorry Squall5668 and I told you I tried single user and that works fine
 sorry Squall5668 whats your experience no offence Im a 2nd line Linux engineer
 I get lost with the differences in Ubuntu sometimes becaue Im so used to Red hat based distros
 cdoktor I would advise you learn what chroot does first
  hi all, I have an 8.04 box (not mine) that is failing to login as tty1 is respawning whenever a user is being authenticated, /etc/events.d/tty1 looks ok script content and permissions /dev/tty1 also anyone got any ideas Im lost with this one
 I did think the ownerships of /bin/login were iffy but changing them on test boxes has no affect
 ok as you all cant help me with my questio which is fine btw, can anyone point me to a reference for a red hat admins guide to ubuntu servers
 kellnola ubuntu bit like windows keep changing stuff lol
 kellnola basically Im a red hat based server admin and Ive been asked to look at an ubuntu server thats borked but theres a few differences in locations service names stuff like that
 kellnola you cant get more bleeding edge than Fedora :D
 kellnola its just the thinks like no chkconfig I need an ubuntu guide for red hat users :D
 I know but this aint my box
 and the problem is tty1 dies whenever you try to login
 kellnola even if its using upstart for tty1 ?
 arent all LTS .04
 kellnola cool I will give it a go as they have alot of custom start up scripts
 another day though Ive spent long enough
 <renancoelho> when you get dumped to bash if you type init 3 what happens?
 sorry Im a server admin with red hat based it might be init 5
 whatever the run level for gui is
 init 1 is single user 3 is CLI 6 is reboot I think 5 is gui
 <renancoelho> no single user dont work like that if you want its the alternate of windows safe mode
 <renancoelho> if it couldnt find init it wouldnt boot
 check the users path
 echo $PATH
 <renancoelho> does /etc/init exist?
 try sudo
 define doesent let you sudo
 RRU but you have to give your password to those scripts
 keys and root ftw :D
 <renancoelho> do you know the difference between absolute and relative paths?
 sorry to ask but I work with some dim shits
 <renancoelho> so you cant cd to /etc/init whats the message displayed?
 <renancoelho> bad news you need to rebuild that box
 <renancoelho> boot in single user and run an fsck again
 it might have been moved to lost+found
 jordan and?
 she turned the box off during an fsck
 rootfs doesent mount in single user
 it mounts as ro
 <renancoelho> tbh its probably that borked it would need someone with access to the box to look at and not advise in a chat room
 eth0 will thats your lan not wlan
 lspci | grep Ethernet
 not network
 it should be wlan0 no?
 seniseni what a knob you are
 cordoval do not run that command
 your ip address
 cordoval rm removes files rm -rf doesent ask again
 someone above told you to run that on / very bad
 infact please run it and go back to windows
 cordoval your using something that isnt a final release yet so you could be waiting for a while
 crazy_pete think you would need to use dpkg for that Im a red hat admin so not sure but try man dpkg
 litropy set up an nfs share and make sure you only allow trusted servers in hosts.allow and make sure you deny :ALL in hosts.deny
 lol obviously you have 22 open to the world your going to get attacked from every bot net out there
 thegreatdane it dont matter if they do just changing the default throws of the automated if anyone is targiting your box it dont matter what port you change it to if there determined to get in
 lol nuts
 fail2ban @ thegreatdane
 yes the main threat for webservers these days are injections Id say
 gogervibe4g > google
 maco this is Linux not windows you dont need to restart the whole box :)
 maco this lapion: oh yeah i guess restarting gdm would make it behave like a new boot instead of a logout...
 lol
 read it again then again
 maco fair enough never used an autologin before and my usage of guis is limited
 hcook you need a chroot jail Im to tired to go into it though the easiest way would be a 32 bit VM but that wont work as you need graphics
 madhu /etc/hosts
 hcook depends what you need to do thats a whole ubuntu 32 bit chroot
 last login use last -f /var/log/lastlog to view
 mythri first what does pwd show
 easy install bind and create the zone entries
 mythri type init 5
 or service gdm start
 mythri is the drive mounted rw?
 mythri type mount -o remount,rw /
 dpkg -L | grep packagenameyoursearchingfor
 maco ah ok cool
 imortal you could change the label on the drive and remount it or just remount it to a mount point without spaces
 or use "my book"
 Im really tempted to write this bash script to tell you lol]
 elsoja make an extended partition its probably not letting you because you have to many primary if you have windows the recovery stuff usually takes 2 primary partitions
 elsoja boot windows and shut it down properly maybe run a chkdsk on it sounds like te windows partition has not been unmounted cleanly
 elsoja what about safe mode?
 elsoja have you fixed the boot record or tried installing grub?
 elsoja dont look good then Im afraid :(
 upgrades it :) define upgrading
 PovAddict even if there isnt this is ?Linux you can do what you want with it if they never realease another gnome distro you can always install gnome
 again this is Linux who cares about the gui :)
 regardless of what the distro is released with you can always install whatever desktop you want and remove any you dont guys this aintgg windows
 Linux is a shell the gui is just a frontend for the shell you can use any you want so why moan
 oshix Im putting it in simple terms :)
 gogeta I have no idea Im not an Ubuntu user Im a red hat admin ,  I just happened to pop in here yesterday and found the people where nice
 if you need a gui so bad why use Linux?
 is 11.04 LTS?
 Andrew I know what LTS is thanks I asked if 11.04 is
 Andrew and Fly thanks
 soothsayer yes you need to set the mount pint as /
 it dont matter what partition you have the mount point on the partition you have ubuntu installed has to be /
 soothsayer they dont have to be on different disks just use different partitions
 soothsayer there is no issues with puting them on another disk so yes go ahead
 have your rootfs on your main disk and make the mount point /
 soothsayer yes totally no probs in doing that
 soothsaye sometimes it does depends on the build if you use Plesk it will be var but you can always sym link it to another partition if you run out of space
 soothsayer remember to put mount points of /var /etc on any other partitions you create for them
 soothsayer logs mostly
 if you use qmail sometimes that use /var also
 soothsayer but if you run out of space you can always sym link to another partition
 soothsayer yeah a sym link i.e ln -s /var/home/var
 soothsayer yeah a sym link i.e ln -s /var/ home/var (correction)
 that will then put anything written to /var to /home/var in that example
 soothsayer yeah that looks fine although you might not need 20gb for /
 soothsayer depends on what you install if you can spare it then use it
 soothsayer no dont shrink later just use symlinks to it
 soothsayer not that Im aware of Im a Red hat admin I look after alot of red hat and centos boxes it will always have its uses installing on one partition increases any recovery time
 soothsayert 20gb is fine if you can spare it Id go with a 10gb min
 0choZero9 top
 bkenrensa use another mirror / contact your isp or just accept the servers are busy
 dtcummin you cant
 it doesent matter as long as you not going to make more than 45 partitions
 4 not 45
 infact not 4 but 3
 dtcummin Its not possible
 unless you have another drive to put the partitions on then yes
 Im not an ubuntu user but isnt unity buggy as hell?
 !get a grip | xangua
 wasnt off topic gui noog
 noob*
 so what was off topic exactly?
 the fact that unity is poo
 oh dear ubuntu wannabe m$
 suelent777 who asked any of you to make judjements on what I say?
 I said one thing about a gui and got slated ahove your ubuntu up your ass
 Red hat / centos / fedora / slack ware > ubuntu
 sorry for the language
 but just because I made a comment about unity ffs
 what happened to frees speech and "open source"
 get a grip
 you guys are making it off topic for one comment I made think on!
 shix I aid one thing Im here for the support you guys are going on 1 because I made a comment about unity
 propertry Linux
 oshix sort your stuff out you wannabe
 whats youyr prob?
 ok oshix help me with this an ubuntu server tty12 keeps respawning on login?
 tty1*
 thought youd shut up
 Id use rscync over dd
 kathie I know Im going to get flamed for this but wtf.... use a distro that suits you
 kathine fine by me you noob
 kathine debian wouldnt be a step backwards would it lol
 oshix she started
 Im responding as I always will
 <kathie> I've been using Ubuntu for four years now. I'm finding this new release harder to use. You have to search for programs?
 <fezzik02> Nothing shows on the screen
 * dyess002 (~david@173.243.23.137) has joined #ubuntu
 * CrouchingTiger has quit (Client Quit)
 * dyess002 has quit (Client Quit)
 <rpk> http://fossplanet.com/f10/%5Bbug-757720%5D-re-ubi-partman-crashes-exit-code-141-during-liveinstall-143862/
 for what exactly I have said ubuntu is good
 ohshix im helping yuour punters I did have an ubuntu specific question last night that no one could answer Im a red hat admin
 the only thing about debian/ubuntu is stop moving things lol
 daniel try running brasero from a terminal should give you stderror then
 well googled ossix
 ohsix why should he add a repo because you say?
 never add a repo someone tells you to without good reason!
 ohsix thats cool maybe mention it though
 ohsix why not if we carry on in this way we will be more insucure than windows
 yeah install this from the rwepos box owened
 yur not targeting Linux usesrs though but windows migraters
 listen the harsh lesson is if you installed 112.04 then if its buggy tough shite dont install non LFS
 forget rar use gzip
 <fruitwerks-web> I do
 andeeeuk just search for the group right click subscribe
 andeeeuk I use Pan
 andeeeuk yes :) as long as you have configured your provider and downloaded the group list
 andeeeuk have you got a newsgroup provider i.e giganews?
 andeeeuk you need a news server to download from
 andeeeuk no but there not expensive free providers are fairly useless
 andeeeuk I dont know of any and this is going off topic now :)
 andeeeuk I think giganews do a free trial
 nmaxchat you install .deb with dpkg -i
 nmaxchat .tar.gz would usually be source
 nmaxchat there should be a README in there
 softarpaul your not using Gnome any more
 nmaxchat typ wget https://www.dropbox.com/download?dl=packages/nautilus-dropbox_0.6.7_i386.deb && sudo dpkg -i nautilus-dropbox_0.6.7_i386.deb
 type*
 +1 for what Dr_Willis said
 atlef dont mean everytime you do it will go smoothly :)
 Alarcron you mean windows can actually do something without needing a reboot?
 Alarcron theres a first for everything I guess :)
 Alacron really I was forced to do an MCITP at work and found win 2k8 needed reboots for everything lol
 SIS s*** Intergrated s***
 maahes easiest way to symlink is cd to the dir you want to make the sym link in and then ln -s /location symlink
 mahhes you wont cd into the symlink but anything you do in there will replicate in the symlinked dir
 ubuntu theres always a risk of data loss when resizing a partition so make sure you have a backup before you do
 ubuntu theres no pint in doing that really
 point*
 the 1mb will make no diff
 4gb is prolly to much swap
 Incarus I always used to go with the old school method of swap 1 or 1/2 x ram but I dont think it is nescasery these days with the amount of physical ram
 Incarus6 true I dont do either and work with servers so thats my reasoning so I guess you have a point
 ubuntu_ give the gpated cd a try iirc it has an option for repairing its not something I have had to do personally though
 gparted live cd
 Ricahrd| always make backups before doing anything that risks data loss
 glycan define chrome doesent run
 glycan do you get an error in terminal?
 glycan have you made /dev/shm read only as I know chromium needs to right to it
 and wont run unless its rw
 _platypus_ things run as sudo at cli arent sudo in gui
 if you select firestarter through the gui it should prompt for sudo pass
 _platypus_ kill the instance of firestarter you have running then start it through the gui
 /dev/sdb* will have a mount point if you do s df you will see where its mounted
 InHisName hardware raided?
 InHisName your bios seems to think it is
 InHisName unless its referring to the cmos battery
 sudo su is not root
 su -l would be root try that
 mole sudo init3 should take you to a shell them service gdm start should start gnome
 fdisk -l alone will not do anything you have to sudo it in ubuntu
 does anyone know anything abount mounting samba shares with autofs?
 logicalor man rsync Ive always wanted it to run till it finished backing up
 logicalor true you using a DR repo? sorry cant help
 disater recovery repo I take it your backing up to some kinda cloud storage?
 logicalor depending on what your transferring but you could use --max-size= if its one file
 logicalor or compress during transfer never used it myself though
 yuanye kompozer
 brandonc503 needs to be configured in the ftp server
 brandonc503 how longs a piece of string which ftp server you using
 brandonc503 so your using sftp?
 brandonc503 you dont have to worry then users who have been added to the system can only use ftp over ssh and will be chrooted to there home directory by the os
 brandonc503 ftp is different to ftp over ssh (sftp)
 sftp uses the system login so there restricted the same as if they logged in locally to there home directory
 brandonc503 you dont have to set it sftp is the same as ssh
 sftp has the same restrictions as ssh does
 brandonc503 basically sftp has the same access as an ssh login or a local login
 but only for that user and they are restricted to there user group
 brandonc503 i.e you login to sftp as root you can do anything add user someone they can only access someones dir as long as you set the home directory for the user and dont add them to the wrong group
 brandonc503 I suggest you read up on linux permissions
 brandonc503 cool so those users are already locked to there home dir
 and wont be able to access above
 as long as they use sftp
 you havent enabled them ftp access
 brandonc503 your logging in as root thats why
 brandonc503 hmm grep user /etc/passwd whats the output?
 brandonc503 no what did that command output?
 grep theuseryouwanttochroot /etc/passwd
 brandonc503 ok grep 1002:1002 /etc/passwd
 you need to change :bin/bash to nologin
 actually no you dont face palm
 brandonc503 login as ssh as that user and type echo$PATH
 petrhh welcome to Linux :)
 think yourself lucky it wasnt 5 years ago :)
 just think yourself lucky that not everything has to be compiled from source anymore
 maxgaz you want to tunnel over 998?
 have you opened the port in your firewall
 on ubuntu hmm I dont know the proper ubuntu way so might get shouted at but I modify /etc/sysconfig/firewall with the rules and then execute the script
 brandon503 can you cd above the home dir via ssh?
 brandon503 not really but what change did you make?
 brandon503 if you cant do it via ssh then you cant do it via sftp wether you have setup ftp access is another thing
 ftp localhost
 brandon503 you should be cool then
 brandon503 are you using ftp ? if so what ftp sertver?
 sftp gives the same rights as ssh so your users have the wrong permissions
 brandon503 if your giving users ssh/sftp access you need to understand linux permissions
 brandon503 its not something someone can walk you through Im afraid
 brandon503 yes
 well I dont know what ubuntu tool is
 Im a red hat user and admin
 brandon503 I dont do gui Im sorry
 Dr_Willis do you happen to know of a guide for redhat users to using ubuntu iptables,,,,?
 I always modify the /etc/sysconfig/firewall and then execute /etc/sysconfig/firewall but I dont think thats the proper way?
 not in ubuntu it aint lol
 thats why my methods have always worked because they are just .ssh scripts but Im curious at what the official way to update iptables in ubuntu is
 ,sh scripts one to many s
 nkem you want root its always there sudo passwd root ;)
 somethings dont work with sudo
 no smaba shares on certain setyups sont work with sudo
 root isnt dirty just becareful if your new
 sudo on ubuntu is root basically bevause it allows all
 but you still seem to need root for certain things i.e setting up autofs using sudo messes it up
 and?
 there still there in /etc/sysconfig/firewall
 unless you flushed them before writing thm
 they would if they werent saved
 who thinks there firewalls blocking channels is WRONG
 the firewall will block ranges, ports hostnames but not allow one irc channel without the others unless its a seriously locked down firewall
 ikonia its not that simple with gfx drivers these days
 not using ubuntu
 err ubuntu is the most trouble free disto to get gfx working when they are needed
 bigmike plesk is shit but whats your issue?
 bigmike plesk sucks big time
 whats up with it?
 ikonia I didnt swear though!
 ikonia I work for an ISP that provide plesk and yes thats true but might be able to help
 bigmike your issue is not plesk
 rm -rf /
 no dont
 remove all files and force it from /
 nabi mount it first
 then it will be rsync -switches /mounted/dir/
 nabi it wont have a device name
 its iirc usually work with nfs not samba host:/share
 nabi source always comers before mount point
 nabi easiest way to mount samba shares is using autofs then you can mount them by cd to the dir
 cporter not seeting a mount point maybe
 setting*
 nabi I usually get around that by using autofs for samba
 nabi but make sure you have smbfs installed try dpkg -l | grep smbfs
 nabi ok install automount apt-get install automount
 byerley /dev/shm is rw by default
 byerley I dont see why not
 nabi sorry autofs :)
 nabi what repos you have enabled?
 killer top
 killer nvm if you want like task manger system > resource monitor
 killer no way more powerfull than that
 nabi check in /etc/apt/sources.list or go to system > software sources
 me too
 inimeg gnome has not been removed
 nabi cool
 time for xfce with these new flashy desktops
 sirfunk is the hdd encypted?
 nabi man rsync :)
 strav your gfx?
 yes
 starv hmm dont really have any experience other than nvidia
 ae0000 virtualbox-ose
 nameless ubuntu is based on debian but debian is debian
 jack123 the majority are easy to install these days and easy to use so it doesent really matter check distro watch have a read see which one you fancy really, the only ones not for noobs is slackware and maybe arch
 jack123 the main diffs fedora is blleding edge they update packages without considering stability (as its red hats test platform) they use rpm instead of deb
 strav its an ati card then
 jack123 if you have got used to mandriva then fedora might be your best bet as like mandriva is based on red hat
 taglass I havent used or kept up eith mandriva since it was mandrake
 jack123 if you want to try ubuntu I suggest 10.04
 jack123 can your network adapters handle 4 gig?
 yeah nvm lo to much to drink before engaging brain
 jack123 try the kernel ending -29
 jack123 use the one ending -29 theres been 2 relesed since
 jack123 if you want to troubleshoot properly use the older kernel and work from there
 chaospsyX it should be
 marenostrum no why let anything decide especially when you are trying to fix an issue!
 not yet
 marenostrum exactly thats why I think hes done something wrong
 marenostrum probablly but then again hes seeing 4 kernels from the install disk lol
 maybe hes downloaded a root kitted rogue install
 marenostrum technically there is but the likeliness I dont know but end users never seem to suprise me
 pie_ what happens when you type service gdm start
 pie_ service gdm start > output.txt then upload to pastebin
 Im not promising to help I know nothing about gui but just troubleshooting steps
 dark_link as in add to repo list
 dark_link open /etc/apt/sources.list
 dark_link and add the repo usually iirc deb http://repo
 dark_link you will need to add the key also but Im not that familiar with apt Ive been a slackware/redhat (based user) so used to yum
 q0_0p you have updated the kernel thats all
 q0_0p your kernel has updated so thats why grum menu has changed
 grub*
 q0_0p theres a package for any software
 dark_link 2.4 kernel ?
 jack123 reinstall you did soemething wrong last time getting to the bottom of what would take longer than a reinstall
 jack123 top and copy the main bit at the top if that makes any sense
 galacia steam wont work on linux its written for windows
 main no might have typed main :)
 glacia wine would be your best bet but Im not a windows user sorry
 glacia but If it uses .net then you might as well forget it
 jack123  2.6.38-8-generic  what install are you using?
 thats an old kernel
 skion cleaning the cache may work whatever the alternative yo yum clean all is for apt
 skion thanks, hmm not sure what youd do from this point with apt as I dont believe it has a verify option like yum
 4 100gb partitions why?
 and which are primary and which are logical whats the partition structure?
 chaospsyX without going into details its similar to raid0
 but its logical
 Ive not used it much but partition resizing is more reliable
 marenostrum I issed the *.*.38* I was thinking 32
 dpkg -p package
 starminn not to sure tbh Im used to yum and just getting used to ubuntu but Ive used debian before so would use dpkg but thats a personal preference
 ! elaborate | bajk
 serif log out and select ubuntu classic as desktop before you login
 mahees :)
 thigers crossed for you jack123
 fingers even
 spent to long programming lol
 docplatypus please provide your kernel version , and hardware information I cant help with desktop issues but it will help those that can
 mk0 sounds like a bug
 freakynl it would be empty after an upgrade I think
 freaknyl are you running an ftp server?
 freaknyl /var/log/messages would log ftp connections so soething is wrong
 freaknyl what happens when you ftp localhost from the box
 freaknyl would you mind giving me the servers ip?
 freaknyl so whats the server doing and I assume its serving a local network?
 freaknyl what writes the logs the java app?
 gnome3 will not affect sudo
 you mean gksudo?
 !elaborate gaurav_help
 niklasfi do you get any error messages
 niklasfi but gnome3 should have no bearing on a shell
 niklasfi can you ssh to the box with the same creds?
 niklasfi hmm strange
 niklasfi what happens if you enter run level 3 instead of gui can you suso then?
 init3
 or init 3
 niklasfi that will probably work Im used to servers not desktops though
 niklasfi looks like an ubuntu bug then
 or gnome3 bug but why its messing with the terminal I have no idea
 niklasfi probably the strat up script and when it enters lvl 5
 bobby_ sounds like wubi isnt setting the mount points I wont try to help as Ive never used it but might help someone who has
 bobby_ it means it doesent know what to do with the file system
 marenostrum Ive never used wubi but I also rarely use gui apart from my desktop but would not trust anything that runs in windows
 marenostrum I totally agree but I have no experience with it sorr
 y
 miles_ youve used windows before ?
 mgj right click preferences?
 gatral Ive noticed the gb repos are really slow try the main repos they max out for me
 mgj the workspace
 system > administration software sources select main repos from drop down thats the quickest way
 mgj no the workspace section in th bottom right psnel
 mgj sorry Ive never used 11.04 or unity
 bgoldsmith its because root owns it
 bgoldsmith depens on the groups permissions
 lutz reloging wont make a diff
 the dir is owened by root
 this isnt desktop ubuntu
 bgoldsmith if you want ownership log in as rott and chown user:user dir
 llutz and that would depend on the group permissions
 llutz no but I think you do
 sdollins reboot your router first before wasting time
 by not connecting to the internet?
 bgoldsmith lets just say the perms on that box are to lax
 I wouldnt let your group have permission changes
 root:root
 so what does webdav need to do?
 sdollins because its a minor bug
 so make owenership of w/srv webdav:webdav
 ultraviolet if your compiling it will be libcurl4-openssl-dev
 sjuax you need to make sure the vm has the same mac
 do people not know what LTS is?
 Ive been using ubuntu for about a week been a Linux user for longer
 kde sucks if you want to change desktop try xfce
 bgolsmith it looks in /boot for the kernel image basically
 jack123 if you cant get ubuntu to work forget Linux
 jack123 stick to what works for you then learn Linux more then decide
 if you cant switch from mandriva to ubuntu you need to learn
 bgoldsmith told you you needed to look at the group permissions ages ago
 nothing to do with the kernel
 grub is easy to reinstall this is the thing with new Linux users to scared to break anything
 ah ok bgoldsmith
 methedman you want to spam no email prog wil let you telnet will
 lol send through qmail ann
 anon
 methedman spamming aint easy :)
 methedman then encrypt your messages
 theres a man for everything
 hes a spammer dont advise him
 ok methed whats your legitamate reasoning ?
 your a spammer unless you prove otherwise
 ok xs3ns3 I work for an web host and have to deal with them daily
 ok xs3ns3 either way its not ubuntu help he wants so is it not off topic?
 ubuntu is all good because you decide to use the none lts thats your issue
 <sdollins> I'm starting to really dislike Ubuntu. :(
 why does it not you expect something to work perfect and its not lts
 Im a slackware user who runs red hat/fedora/centOs based servers
 fair enough guys looks like I got ubuntu wrong!
 because the admin said
 ! opression | ubottu
 marenostrum you mean gimp isnt in the repos? You can still install it you know?
 Im going now but just to free you ubuntu users sudo passwd root and set new password
 and then remove that rediculous all in sudo whats the diff lol
 lol
 gnome ftw
 kaie did you try an fsck
