 hello people! I have installed ubuntu 10.10 on my Samsung netbook and hasn't given me problems (wifi only has got a few issues). did an update today and I've lost the side menu. I don't know what to do... I have tried to restart many times but every time there is nothing but my wallpaper on the screen.. any suggestions???
