 does anybody know how i can resize the application launcher? it looks ugly as fck fullscreen
 izinucs: i dont see it... O.o
 izinucs: if its under i looked in behavior and experimental and both dont seem to have a related setting
 izinucs: kk thx anyways! i have a 2600x1200 screen and having it take my entire screen is just the most annoying thing on earth
 SOOOOOOOOOOO FUGLY!!!!
 izinucs, its a samsung. i dont think they make them anymore though
 izinucs, cost me a small fortune
 this lack of customization is killing me
