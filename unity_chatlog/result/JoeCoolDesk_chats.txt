 I upgraded to 11.04
 That was a mistake
 Now it's sitting on startup "The disk drive for / is not ready yet or not present"
 ohsix, I'm just dual-booting with windows
 The root of the filesystem?
 ohsix, it was working yestreday and it's not today after the upgrade.  The windows partition works so it's not the HDD
 ohsix, what aare you talking about?
