 What's the best way to write a BootCD of Ubuntu in Ubuntu?
 acicula,  Alright- I was just wondering if you needed another application to make it bootable like the Windows ImgBurn/MagicISO etc
 Thanks though
 Yo - I'm currently having an issue when booting into my Ubuntu 11.04 USB - The screen just goes all fuzzy like static but still static.

 DonDraper,  - Reinstall!
 Well it depends if you've ran it as root :P
 Glycan - If you want to delete the contents of a folder you do the rm -f but you do it like for example "rm -f /home/user/folder"
 I've a question here on the upgrade for some reason Ubuntu wont install from my BOOT USB it goes all static on my screen, apt-get dist-upgrade wont upgrade it, running the updater with my Boot USB fails from multiple attempts from multiple downloads.
 So what else is the best way to upgrade from the Beta of the Ubuntu 11.04 to the latest?
 ikonia,  - I've already done that will run it again though
 That command
 The dist upgrade
 And updating my apt

 That's the thing I know I'm not upto date
 If I plug my BootUSB into my laptop and run Update-Manager it tells me there is an update and trys to install it from the USB.
 But for some reason it chucks errors at me, I cannot install from the USB as the screen turns like static you get from a TV but it doesn't move.
 jrib - Can I pm you I can't read while everyone else is chatting and logging in/out of IRC
 Alright, that gives 500s on everything can pastebin it for you if you like.
