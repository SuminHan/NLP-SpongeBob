 woo! anyone upgrading to narwhal right now?
 i could get rid of docky right?
 shane4ubuntu, how do you feel about unity?
 shane4ubuntu, hehe
 i have no clue about unity :(
 shane4ubuntu, if upgrade to narwal, i could remove docky right? do i also still need compiz to do cool desktop switching?
 shane4ubuntu, eek!
 Herbs, those are concepts to stabilize society. much like religion. duh
 -_-
 oooh i just remembered something important (to me at least): will i be able to type in korean, chinese, and japanese when i upgrade?
 i use the keyboard input methods thing on 10.10
 will that still be around when i upgrade?
 dasy2k1, what do you mean? i can't search synaptic or something?
 Herbs, seriously, as long as you aren't flooding the channel, who cares what you type?
 ah ok
 dasy2k1, do you have suggestions for switching language inputs? or is keyboard input methods the best one?
 i like it because i can CTRL+space and type in 한글
 OMG this is taking soooo long to download
 and i have a final tomorrow. i kinda don't wanna sleep until i've figured it out
 lsheeba, oooh
 thanks for that!
 wooo! i'm almost done downloading
 yay
 oooh. 11.04 is now installing.
 wish me luck everyone haha
 efox29, anything i should look out for?
 i can lose docky right?
 also, anyone know of an easy way to switch language inputs?
 efox29, you're talking about the aesthetics or the actual functionality?
 oop
 anyway. anyone know a nice way to switch language inputs on narwhal? i use keyboard input methods on 10.10 i wonder if it'll carry over nicely
 noob question but if i buy a mac book pro, i could just install ubuntu over it and it'll work fine right? any issues regarding that?
 zachgretzinger, that's pretty much it. i just like the design haha
 OOOH i'm about to restart!
 this is so exciting
 wooo
 how do i make it so that i'm asked for a password every time i sudo?
 that seems to have been gone when i restarted into 11
 hi everyone! i'm on narwhal right now. things are looking pretty good except for zeitgeist. will i be able to remove it without incurring penalties?
 or is zeitgeist something we're not allowed to talk about :X
 o well. i'm removing zeitgeist right now
 i have made peace with zeitgeist...for now -_-
 Phylock, i'm looking into it myself
 anyone know how i can display bandwidth usage and system resources at the top in narwhal?
 ok i got an interesting problem. i use the windows key (Super L) as a shortcut for terminal. it also happens to be the shortcut for narwhal's dash. i tried changing the shortcut for narwhal dash to CTRL+SuperL but then terminal doesn't pop up anymore. when i hit SuperL, BOTH dash and terminal pop up.
 it's okay. minus zeitgeist
 so... since i can't change the shortcut key for terminal in control center > keyboard shortcuts, how do i do it using the terminal?
