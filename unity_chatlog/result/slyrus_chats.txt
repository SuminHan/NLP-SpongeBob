 what do package versions like 3.2.is3.0.1-0ubuntu1?
 how can I make my upstart script wait for my nfs volumes to get mounted?
 cheapie: hmm... sounds like a hack, but OK.
 yeah, that seems to be the only decent documentation on this thing I can find
 I'm troubled that 1) my script is firing when I have a start on (filesystem and started avahi) line and 2) it doesn't respawn until the nfs mounts succeed
 ok, thanks Cheapie
 Loshki: fair enough... but why use rc.local instead of upstart?
 Loshki: don't the same problems exist there?
 in any event, I think I've fixed that problem and am on to forked-daapd quitting for some other reason :(
