 just received the new update and now I have no wireless networking... I have the third party bcm43xx drivers installed but I do not remember what to type to bring up the wireless networking... thought it was something like ifconfig wlan0 up...but not sure
 litropy, it is enabled in the bios... the only change that I made to the system was to upgrade to 11.04... from 10.
 this is on my laptop and the wireless is not coming up when I press the button
 ok
 i will try that
 litropy, i guess i could uninstall and reinstall...
 [the driver]
