 would anybody feel magnanimous enough to help me with some problems with an Ubuntu 11.04 upgrade?
 I've just upgraded from Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04 using the Update manager and after the install, when the computer rebooted I got the Grub prompt and have been unable to boot into Ubuntu
 I am currently running 11.04 live cd
 I've just upgraded from Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04 using the Update manager and after the install, when the computer rebooted I got the Grub prompt and have been unable to boot into Ubuntu
 I am running Natty Live CD right now, is it possible for me to recover my old Home Directory from Ubuntu 10.10?
 when upgrading from 10.10 to 11.04, should my Home directory and files be safe?
 Soothsayer: after the upgrade (from Update manager) I rebooted but got stuck on the GRUB prompt
 Soothsayer: now I'm running Natty Live CD to try to access my old Home directory
 soothsayer: I can't find my home and data files now.
 Soothsayer: I didn't format.
 Soothsayer: It was just an upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 using the Update manager
 SoothSayer: I think that all of my data and files were wiped with the upgrade.
 Soothsayer: Not from CD, from Ubuntu Gnome Update Manager
 Soothsayer: Then after all of the new files were installed and old files removed the computer rebooted and instead of booting Ubuntu I got the GRUB prompt
