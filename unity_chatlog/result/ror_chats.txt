 what's the best way to report a bug? Got a repeat of bug #464064 but for 11.04 :(
 thanks cdbs; A bit concerning it's still "new" after 2 years tho o.0
 "could not download the release notes" < is that ubuntu being overloaded or is my conn being funny?
 Also, does anyone know if it's possible to upgrade from 32bit to 64bit? I'd like to do it without nuking /home if possible
 thanks :(
 my PC completely froze about 12 hours into do-dist-upgrade D:
 what's happened to the system > preferences menu? I can't find it now :(
 the new interface is horrible D: it does that "mac" thing of having all the application menus in a separate bar, but most annoyingly I can't seem to move the launcher panel to the top? What's with not being able to create as many panels as one wishes?
 booting into ubuntu-classic option I get no launchers, panels etc, I can't launch anything :(
 Is there anything I need to add if I remove unity?
 please can somebody help? I can't seem to get ubuntu-classic to work
 wtf, I can't remove unity without removing ubuntu-desktop?
 Right, how can I get the chromium launcher to LAUNCH A NEW WINDOW when I click it? At the moment it just brings back up the window I already have open
 this is exactly why I switched away from windows in the first place, because windows 7 was doing that
 Since when did #ubuntu become so unhelpful?
 ramshot: that did work for me, thanks
 ejv: I was just pointing out there seems to be a lot of regression this release to make things more like windows or mac, when ubuntu was better
 ejv: how? It's not working for me, even "ubuntu-classic" isnt' working for me
 I'd happily switch back, but trying to uninstall unity I got "also need to uninstall ubuntu-desktop" which worried me
 folivora: my gfxcard isn't at fault? And if I choose "ubuntu classic" I just get my desktop background and a cursor, and no panels/menus etc
 It just annoys me how Canonical are such clowns these days. Ever since the "megabug" over the naming of Ubuntu One, they've acted in their interests only. For example they just added a load of their apps to my launcher without asking, they now have a launcher you can't configure, you can't even move the panel to the bottom of the screen; Window switching used to be easy, by scrolling the mousewheel over the panel, you can't do
  that now. I guess the "solution" is to go to debian, but I've been using Ubuntu since edgy and I *liked* it.
 But I don't want minimal, I like all the effects and fancy stuff, but they've gone from applications where you can configure every last detail to applications where the application forces *your* behaviour
 that and not being able to scroll through open windows with the mouse wheel is horribly worse for me, it's the only way I used to switch windows
 right, thanks for the help some of you, I've almost got it back to how I've liked
 still can't work out how to get my scale switcher back, but that'll do for now
 btw to anyone having problems loading classic; the way I did it was to load "classic (no effects)" then in that switch off "unity plugin" in CCSM, then switch back to "Classic"
 Sik: In Administration > Login Screen, there's a choice for "Default"
 because it's regressive not progressive
 cybrhuman, no it DOESN'T
 with 16:9 it's more important to have icons across top/bottom where you can see them all; and I used to use left hand toolbars when I had 4:3
 the fact unity doesn't even allow you to choose where to have the launcher is crazy
 in gnome-classic I can have as many panels as I wish, configure them all as I wish; Unity takes away control
 with 16:9 people don't maximise windows, they have long top/bottom menus making the space 16:8 then split the screen into two 8:8 sections for windows
 cybrhuman, no they did NOT have to be there! You can add/remove/move them as you wish in gnome. In Unity you cannot move them
 green: it takes the worst of mac (single menu at the top) and worst of windows (launchers don't open new instances but switch to old ones) and combines them
 cybrhuman, sure, but you can put a small panel on the left/right/wherever in gnome-classic, you can't with unity, so how is unity an improvement?
 by simply forcing you to have the setup the developers want you to have without letting you customize it, is not a progressive step
 Sik: first time I had to boot to an older kernel, then dpkg --configure
 Ubuntu jumped the shark around the time of bug #375345 tbh
 let's take this ot then
 krad: reboot
 or if everything is frozen, ctrl+f2 to get to a terminal, then ctrl+alt+del
