 crazyrohila, well, some people say that it will kill my thumb drive faster
 crazyrohila, uhhm, ok, thanks
 Diosjoe, in my life I did 3 upgrades, none of these decisions were good.
 Diosjoe, well, you can upgrade, but be prepared for some things to get fucked up
 Soothsayer, you can change the size later
 Soothsayer, but yeah, swap must be a little bit bigger than your memory
 Soothsayer, for swap?? there's no filesystem for swap
 Soothsayer, for you system you'll be good with ext4
 Soothsayer, just choose SWAP, it doesn't ask for filesystem
 samtate, it's your laptop feature, you can't change this behavior
 samtate, oh, then try alsamixer or gamix
 Soothsayer, oh, when it asks for file system choose linux-swap
 Soothsayer, that's for swap of course
 Soothsayer, don't worry
 Soothsayer, after installation you can run live cd and change your partitions any way you want
 tauntaun, like someone knows what is itunes, lol, I never got a point of it.
 conical well maybe you need something smaller than ubuntu?
