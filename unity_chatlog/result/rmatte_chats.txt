 does anyone know of a simple way to revert to the versions of compiz/emerald that were included with 10.10 after upgrading to 11.04?  The new version of emerald is buggy with my window theme.
 billybob: glxgears is just an indication that OpenGL is functional, it is not an indication that compositing (which is required for Unity) is functional.
 billybob: are you by any chance using two monitors across two different video cards?
 billybob: or one video card that has two cards in it connected via SLI across two monitors?
 sorry, clarify?
 karthick87: not to be rude, but come on: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=remove+ppa+repo+from+commandline
 billybob: I didn't understand what you meant by "no one both"
 what is your setup?
 I have lots of experience with this sort of thing but I need to know what your setup is
 billybob: ok
 billybob: what kind of video card are you using?
 billybob: hmmm, what about unity isn't working?
 are you seeing artifacts left behind by windows and stuff?
 billybob: oh, that's really weird
 billybob: it ran on my work workstation which has no graphics acceleration of any kind (didn't run well at all, but it did start)
 billybob: sounds like possibly a package problem or something
 billybob: unfortunately Unity is too new... I don't have any tricks up my sleeve for that one, I'd just be googling around like you are
 billybob: have you tried using Unity 2D?
 billybob: apt-get install unity-2d
 then it'll be available in the list of session in your login manager
 so just logout, select it, and log back in
 billybob: yeh
 I have to take off for now, later
