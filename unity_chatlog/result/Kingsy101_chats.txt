 guys how do I set a static local IP address on my local machine?
 ifconfig tells me its changed from 192.168.0.11 to 192.168.0.4 I need to change it to 192.168.0.11 perminatly
 extraclassic - yeah I was looking at that but, my interfaces file only contains 2 lines
 it looks NOTHING like that example
 should I just add a "address 192.168.0.11" line ? and thats it ?
 anyone?
 extraclassic - so change    iface lo inet loopback   to     iface lo inet static     and then insert the other info below ?
 extraclassic - is that right ?
 extraclassic - ah ok
 thanks
 I am assuming my ubuntu pc is using dhcp.. however in /etc/network/interfaces there is only two lines --> auto lo      iface lo inet loopback        shouldnt there be another two lines regarding eth0 and dhcp ?
 i.e am I looking in the wrong file ?
 ActionParsnip - so what would you advise is the easiest way to get it on a static ip ?
 ActionParsnip - ok I will try..
 ActionParsnip - what is the difference between network and gateway ? when I am specifying them in the interfaces file ?
 I cant see reference to either in a ifconfig
 celthunder - how do I find out my subnet ?
 celthunder - I thought that was the subnet mask ?
 sorry mask
 celthunder - so if thats the case what do I put for "mask" ?
 can someone tell me where I find out    network and gateway  for the interfaces file? I cant see mention of them in ifconfig...
