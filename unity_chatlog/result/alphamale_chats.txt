 can someone help me with running ubuntu live on a usb, i already have grub and puppy running on it
 i dont want to partition
 and where do i perform the install from
 i can mount the ubuntu iso in puppy
 but then what
 soreau: will that wipe my usb partition? i want to keep the data on it
 yes, but does ubuntu need its own partition
 i want to run it as a live usb
 ok i could do that but i have grub already on it
 i just want to select booting into ubuntu instead of puppy
 can i just modify the grub menu entry that comes with ubuntu, add it to my menu.lst?
 and then put ubuntu in its own directory
 i just want a small debian that works well with python
 if someone wants to pm me that's fine it's too confusing here
 how can i install ubuntu on a usb from puppy linux
 i have the iso and a usb partition
 ?
 i can copy the iso onto the usb no problem
 but how do i install
 sorry i am not getting it celthunder
 can i just make a new menu entry in my grub file?
 i need some help installing ubuntu on a usbdrive, already running puppy linux and editing the menu.lst file
 i have grub4dos now
 i dont want to do that either
 i unmounted the iso and copied files to a new partition on the usb
 got the splash screen then problems
 i think im close it's just not finding some files
 what is the easiest way to install or run a live iso
 i have a usb
 i created a partition on it
 do i need to unpack the iso or can i just stick the iso on it
 i was trying to follow directions from here...https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromLinux#Troubleshooting
 but this line i think caused problems...
 /casper/vmlinuz boot=casper root=/dev/ram ramdisk_size=1048576 rw
 i dont have a /dev/ram directory in my usb
 i tried all day to add ubuntu to grub4dos
 couldnt get it working
 this seemed like the easiest way to do it...

 someone that can help me install ubuntu from a working linux system?
 i have no cdrom
 i want to install on a usbdrive partition
 i am running puppy
 grub4dos bootloader
 i used this site...
 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromLinux
 does the usb have to be formatted ext3?
 yes i would like to boot the iso too but failed
 i have grub4dos not grub
 i googled it
 found some sites but it didnt work yet
 you can supposedly boot from iso with puppy
 but i messed something up
 no idea
 i dont have grub2
 i am booting from grub4dos
 how about this portable linux app
