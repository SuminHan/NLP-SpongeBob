 heya, anyone able to help me check this issue out. I see a white _ on boot and my hard drive swirls a bit then seems to halt and no os is booted at all, what could be wrong?
 sgaap, nope
 sgaap, Im currently on a live but dunno if I want to dable with grub due to my dual boot setup, is it smart enough to recognize my win install?
 sgaap, so, google reinstall grub or something?
 sgaap, dunno, where do I find out / guess in the file system somewhere, or can I somehow boot into it from the live session?
 sgaap, no its the hd3 I think, but Im not sure how to go from here really, Ive got a live ubuntu usb stick in where I can access irc ^^
 sgaap, ah, I see, cheers
 sgaap, right, got grub installed now
 sgaap, just to be sure, what exactly did I have to type if I wanted to install grub on hd3?
 sgaap, hmmz, Im pretty confident that I changed the boot order in my bios to first boot from my hd3 disk is that the same thing_
 sgaap, right, lemmi give that a go
 sgaap, thnx for the help, appreciate it - but I think Im just going to revert my bios settings and format and do a clean install
 sgaap, got all my data backed up any way, grub and mbr is the next chapter of my linux learning experience me thinks
 sgaap, oh, really, package name listed on that wiki link perhaps?
 sgaap, thnx
 sgaap, yeap, brb and thnx again ^^
 sgaap, yay! :D Im in, thank you so amazingly much ;P
 sgaap, ch-something something mounting all partitions and installing grub that way worked like a charm =)
 sgaap, make sur to go to sleep with a smile, u did someoone else really happy today =) now Im off, thnx again
