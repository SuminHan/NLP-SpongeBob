 Vampire if you are running a daemon on your Linux box your localhost is 127.0.0.1 connect to that IP address.
 Hey guys I installed X11VNC and it worked and doesn't work. It has a mind of its own It has error warnings that seem quite stupid any suggestions besides using FreeNX?
 It also has an error warning to disable the error warnning. How stupid is that?
 Dr_Willis, I don't mind experimenting with anything that is worth while.
 Dr_Willis I have tried TightVNC in fact it was the first VNC device I used. It seems good, but with Windows it started to talk to some internet servers I never programmed it for.
 With a good Windows Net Monitor you can see what software is talking to who.
 Dr_Willis I block anything that is suspect.
 Dr_Willis, I was using SSH with Secure VNC with X11vnc.
 Dr_Willis when I installed the Ubuntu Repositories and stuff like that it stopped working.
 Dr_Willis I apt-getted the FreeNX but got frustrated with the operation.
 If FreeNX works I will use it.
 Dr_Willis I did a  sudo apt-get upgrade and    sudo apt-get upgrade    and     sudo apt-get aptitude.
 Also sudo apt-get update
 Dr_Willis the X11vnc worked just fine when I first installed Ubuntu, after installing the updates and upgrades it failed.
 Dr_Willis I am just experimenting and as you very well know when I come here I like to try diffrent things. I will try what is better or what is best.
 Dr_Willis, as you said it is just a tool.
 Dr_Willis I use it for lazy  minded people who pay me for my services.
 Cursarion, even if you boot up into a disk you still need to Low Level Format it. What are you trying to do?
 Cursarion, then you would need to be God to do that. How do you expect to install anything without a CD/DVD/USB   Unless it is a HD?
 I have done the floppy disk install and USB and CD and HD. Cursarion needs to provide enough information to let us know how he will fix his problem.
 Cursarion now you are letting us know what you are really doing. Having two hard drives is different.
 Cursarian,  SATA or IDE?
 Dr_Willis thanks for the advice. I always appreciate your input. Good man.
