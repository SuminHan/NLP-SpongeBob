 codex84: try classic ubuntu.
 codex84: switch to a terminal, reboot from the command line, and then change to classic ubuntu before logging in.
 codex84: Eh? GDM isn't even starting? Ugh-oh.
 kz3: I wouldn't.
 rgr: Well, not completely from the sounds of it...
 kz3: Give it a week or two.
 kz3: It's pretty hairy so far.
 linux: 9.10 is EOL.
 lduros: I got Classic working, but it's ugly... and enabling compiz brings on other issues, like missing window decorations (which can be enabled in ccsm.. but that has to be installed)
 lduros: Not so bad... I do everything but web browsing from the command line. :)
 lduros: Heh. That's why my wife is using Lucid. :)
 Atharva: switch to classic, install ccsm, enable them.. and don't forget to enable window decorations.
 bah. what's teh command to return a terminal to a usable state when you screw up and cat a binary file?
 Loshki: thanks. :)
