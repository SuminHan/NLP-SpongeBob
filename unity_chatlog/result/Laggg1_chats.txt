 hello
 I have upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 and I have lost my GRUB
 Im in a live CD right now
 I've mounted my SDA1
 but I uh, cant seem to go on with the right commands
 chroot isnt working
 Can anyone help me solve this grub_rescue problem since I upgraded to 11.04?
 escott?
 How would the commands go, proper order?
 mount point /mnt/ubuntu/dev does not exist
 escott: chroot: failed to run command `/bin/bash': No such file or directory
 im supposed to do this to the ubuntu system?
 Im doing this to the Win7 HDD
 I have two seperate HDDs.
 Am I supposed to mount the ubuntu HDD?
