 anybody using Full Disc Encryption on 11.04?
 @meraqlix, wat u mean menus missing?
 uhh. I'm so sick of gnome 2x
 ctrl+alt=F1 is for debugging isn't it? use ctrl+alt+F2
 repos
 ctrl+alt+T didn't work by default for me in 11.04. you have to add that shortcut.
 middle mouse paste working on my box
 @phed, try the Beta version of Flash available through flash-aid. Although I have blank screen prob too sometimes and don't know a fix
 lol snake
 @rhin0, if you want SSD, i think it best to use 10.10 or 11.04
 @Brandano, Unity is awesome. I was actually thinking of going back to Windows cause of sick of gnome2x. Unity is a huge improvement
 @AMAG  I have had nothing but trouble with NVIDIA graphics when trying 11.04. I'm done with NVIDIA.
 @Brandano, I never used Compiz before because it was too fancy. You don't have to use cmopiz for Unity. Just install 11.04. and it works
 @celthunder: that's what I've herad, nvidia better supported. But they give me nothing but trouble with Unity. AMD/ATI radeon and Intel integrated give zero problems so far with Unity.
 @celthunder: how exactly do I install the open source NVIDIA drivers? be great to get unity working on my nvidia machines
 rhin0, i think you best to use 1010 or 1104 to avoid trouble
 @rhin0: 10.04 kernel does NOT have TRIM
 @phibxr: you mean NVIDIA? what binary drivers?
 @celthunder: I already uninstalled the proprietary because they were crap. When I do this, graphics just work. So whatever default driver Ubuntu is using is working. BUT it won't do Unity 3D even though my graphics card supports 3D with the proprietary NVIDIA driver
 @phibxr: so the default ones are the open source ones? These won't do Unity 3D. Although the proprietary one do do 3D when I'm using Windows XP
 @1403: you can just disable sound. That is, system related sounds. You will still hear music etc if you play it
 @phibxr: no can't run nvidia settings since unisntalling proprietary. I can use the "Monitors" to set up res etc with the default Ubuntu drivers
 @1403: go to settings, look for sound. There is a setting to disable sound (ie system sounds). Then when you login for example no sound will be played
 @phibxr. hehe. lol. Can't get Unity to work 3D with the default graphics driver. But graphics card works 3D with proprietary driver on Windows XP
 @filosofixit, have friends try running the LIVE CD and see if he can fix it up that way
 @phibxr, well I tried the proprietary on Ubuntu. Problem I had, it would never remember settings after reboot :)  So for example every reboot my res would return to 800x600 or something.
 @phibxr, yes this is what I did but none of them worked to do 3D with unity
 NVIDIA Geforce 3 from 2001 :0
 Ivy Bridge graphics supposed to make gains over current Sandy Bridge. Hopefully this whole proprietary drive things will be a thing of past
 @phibxr, no. I'll give this a go tonight. Thanks for tip
 @phibxr, but wouldn't update manager install any updated drivers?
 @edbian, this channel is goin nuts! lol
 @phibxr, i def try tonight. thx :)
 @phibxr, Thunderbird released security update last thrusday. I still haven't received an update. Makes me wonder if I can rely on updates sometimes.
 @phibxr, ah, I worry about Google knowing everything about me. I wish I could sell my own info to make money. Instead everyone else sells me and makes profit oOOo
