 Question- is there anyway to make the Unity bar smaller?
 Does anyone else suffer a Widescreen effect up booting up?
 Belinrahs: When I load, and hit the login screen, I will have a section of black on both sides of the screen.
 Belinrahs: So that should make it where it remains full screen? And how would I do that? Under System Settings?
 Belinrahs: No problem. Thank you for taking the time to help me.
 Belinrahs: Thanks :)
 Is there any good way to drop straight to your Desktop? I keep having to minimize multiple windows to get there, and there has to be a better way.
 Firestarter on 11.04- can't log events, as it says I'm not root. Any thoughts on how to fix this?
 ikonia: Have tried, no luck.
 sudo firestarter, but when I hit the GUI, can't log events.
 Clicking on it. There is probably something simple I'm missing.
 ikonia: I will try that.
