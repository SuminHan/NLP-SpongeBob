 unity is just terrible and compiz no longer works....is it better just to wipe and reinstall 10.10 ?
 resistant to a terible gui
 i run linux to screw around with and have fun with the OS and gui
 not to be forced to conform to 2nd rate code
 galamar nope it's all gone
 switch to classic or reinstall 10.10
 yes
 jsebean most definitely a fail
 go back to 10.10
 *blackbox
 anyhthing is better then unity
 indeed
 no
 helo: give them 10.10
 unity needs years of dev and perhaps so testing next time
 unity is a useless window manager implemented in 11.04 to replace gnome the far superior window manager
 great it should be removed then easily and not be so huge
 unity wiped out the desktop sphperes and all the setting i had on my machine since 8.04
 really....
 cause right now i got for stupid desktop s side by each and my extra monitor won't open a thing
 er four
 unity not good with multiple monitor ?
 unity is useless they need to redo that whole section and put back gnome
 unity is a wannabe osx gui that's all i see
 i'd take beOS even over unity
 unity is a massive plugin that wipes out all your settings and forces you to conform to a new way of setting up your desktop
 really ? is that the canonical plan to complete against osx ? :(
 10.10 was awesome i wish they hadn't of done this
 perhaps making unity the new option to try insteaqd of forcing it
 seb no doubt: guess they are tired of hearing about the terrible rls
 the default should be the default i would be more then happy to test out and learn a new gui gradually
 so unity is a compiz plugin or a gnome plugin ?
 really ? i have cause running beta is a great idea
 why did unity wipe out my settings in compiz ? i had a sphere with 4 desktops and two running vbox windows in them
 how can i get all that back
 nuts: did that still have nothing
 and i opened ccsm all settings gone
 dotblank : should have*
 hrm :(
 guys i dunno if canonical see any of this ...but it's pretty sad i spent months perfecting my laptop and now it's shot after the 11.04 upgrade ...unity is terrible and shouldn't have been set as the default
 my desktop still has 10.10 and i will never change that
 yeah it's my fault
 i have a backup from 2 weeks ago will have to restore that
 i'm not now i changed
 but all my settings are gone
 laser you don't mount an rar
 extract it
 you can view the files inside without extracting if that is what you mean
 nope
 they've removed it
 it does not have compiz
 all setting are overridden by unity
 none of the features work
 you can keep saying it has compiz
 but you know why people run compiz
 for the fancy features and none work for uniuty
 i'm running it too no plugins work except the unity one which is lame
 he was hoping to alret you to my complaints about releasing beta software in a major release
 ccsm doesn't open on my second nor does anything else after the upgrade ...any ideas ?
 11.04 not able to do multiple screens yet ?
