 how is 11.04?
 NictraSavios: I thought the .04 was supposed to be the stable one
 NictraSavios: 11.04 isnt LTS?
 ok maybe its time to go back to slackware
 AbuMaia: I also read some bad reviews for 11.04.. I'll try the live CD and see
 thanks NictraSavios
 slackware is at v13.37
 L4nce0: gj
 izinucs: it depends on the size of your HD
 hiexpo: I dont complain yet, I try the live CD first
 izinucs: partition size
 hiexpo: I said maybe.. I will say for sure after I try the live CD
 hiexpo: does that sound fair
