 Hello
 I have a problem. I am on my touch so bare with grammar please. I just updated to the new version of ubuntu. My problem is that I am unable to get any sort of wifi connection. When I run my finger across the wifi button, it won't even turn on. Once again, sorry for the grammar.
 Hello, guys. I have a problem with the new release of ubuntu with my wifi connection. Before installing, my wifi was working just fine, but now I can't turn it on when I swipe my finger over the wifi button. I can swipe my finger over it to turn it on at boot up, but once I get to my login menu, my mouse wont move. Any insight into what my issue is would be great.
 Would someone mind giving me some insight into why the new release has issues with wireless connections?
 Also, I'm wondering if it's possible to go back a version. (10.04).
 I'm sure I'm not the only one having wireless issues with the new version of Ubuntu, right?
 Hey, guys. I've run into an issue while trying to install gnome3 on ubuntu 11.04. When trying to log in, I get an ICE authority error about how it couldn't be updated. I'm hoping there is a fix to this.
 Ahh. I think I can fix it now. ctrl-alt-f1 brings me to the terminal. :D
 I would like to convert from gnome 3 back to unity for the 11.04 distribution. Any insight on how to go aboutdoing this would be great.
 :D
 Hello, guys. I've downloaded ubuntu 11.04 and things work fine. The problem is, I swapped to the Classic Gnome theme, but don't like it at all. I would like to swap back to the Unity theme, but I'm unsure of how to do this. I tried to go to the login screen settings, but did not see an option for switching back to the Unity theme, unfortunately.
 lubuntu: I didn't quite understand what you said. Could you rephrase it?
 lubuntu: I think my problem is that I installed gnome 3. I need to uninstall it so that I'll have the Unity option again. Unity is broken with gnome 3.
 lubuntu: Thanks. I will try it. First I'm going to try to figure out how to uninstall Gnome3.
