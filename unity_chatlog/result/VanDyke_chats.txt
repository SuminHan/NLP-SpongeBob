 k
 there
 sdollins, I disliked gnome3 and unity
 staying with 10.10
 thegoodcushion, lsusb will tell if it's connected
 thegoodcushion, no idea
 sdollins, stop trolling :P
 sdollins, install ubuntu 10.10 and be done with it. Works awesome
 just install Windows ME. You'll be happy, I promise.
 sdollins, no, it's gonna be Clabuntu
 whoever came up with Unity was on heavy crack
 marenostrum, works fine
