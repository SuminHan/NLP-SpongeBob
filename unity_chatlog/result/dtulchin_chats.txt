 i have a question, after upgrading to 11.04, my compiz options for edges are gone...i try to install simplecompiz and it tells me i cant .... (options for effects like minimize all screens, see all desktops, etc.)

 i'm trying to get edges to work...
 anyone know how to get edges to work in ubuntu 11.04 without unity?
 is there a way to fix ubuntu 11.04 from the live-cd?
 is there a way to repair ubuntu 11.04 from live-cd?
 all the packages
 during upgrade...possible that packages got damaged
 my internet fell
 during the upgrade
 yes
 everything loads fine...for some reason my sources.list didnt get updated
 nit-wit: my sources list didnt get updated
 nit-wit: any ideas?
 is there a way to fix 11.04 completely?
 i can run command line
 yes
 nit-wit: yes
 nit-wit: it failed during the downloading of the upgrade
 nit-wit: i then restarted it and finished
 nit-wit: when i boot from the cd, i get options: try ubuntu, and install ubuntu...nothing about repairing ubuntu
 nit-wit: i am running a damaged 11.04
 nit-wit: thats dissapointing
 nit-wit: so my only other option is to reinstall an entire os?
 duckx0r: is it a desktop or laptop?
