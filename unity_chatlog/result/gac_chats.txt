 I tried installing 11.04 this morning and failed. Everything seemed to go OK, but when I rebooted, it appeared that the bootloader wasn't installed properly (I just got my motherboard's generic "no bootable device" message). /var/log/syslog during the installation says that grub-install worked though. Anyone else having similar problems?
 Jordan_U: no, I've just plugged in a spare SATA drive on its own for the Ubuntu installation
 jeija: I could, but if this is a bug then I would rather know so I can file it. I don't really need it to work as I'm not a fulltime Ubuntu user :)
 Jordan_U: yes, it is
 stefg: there's only one drive. how can there be confusion? :)
 stefg: no, I said I plugged a spare drive in on its own. I.e. not in addition to my working Windows 7 installation
 jeija: stefg: no, it can't, there's only the intended Ubuntu disk plugged in right now
 stefg: not right now, I'm IRCing from my laptop. Give me a couple of minutes and I can boot the Live CD
 stefg: wouldn't that just be doing the same thing as the installer does though, which isn't working?
 Jordan_U: yes, it is
 Jordan_U: it's also set to the first boot device, and the error also shows up if I boot the LiveCD and then pick "boot from hard drive"
 stefg: it's booting now, so I'll take a quick look. My impression is that for some reason grub isn't actually getting into the MBR on my disk, so the config files are probably all sane, but grub isn't actually present and therefore won't read them
 stefg: not that I've seen, no. I have checked for that sort of thing. Also it's the same version of the BIOS and same settings that were set when I installed Windows 7 ~6 months ago when I bought the PC. there's a BIOS upgrade which I may try applying shortly
 Jordan_U: yeah, I'll have a look at that link, LiveCD is just booting up now
 Jordan_U: http://pastebin.com/X2sLaKMy
 Jordan_U: you're right, seems that way. I'll apply the update which is available and see what that does. if I can find a 10.10 CD handy I'll try installing that, I'm sure that's worked on this PC and this disk in the past
 Jordan_U: applied the BIOS update. Still no luck. I have just noticed that this disk takes a lot longer to be detected by the BIOS than my windows7 disk, I wonder if the disk is failing in a very subtle way
 Jordan_U: located the problem. I can't boot from my Ubuntu disk with AHCI enabled. Turning it back to IDE mode in the BIOS detects my spare disk straight away, and Ubuntu boots fine.
