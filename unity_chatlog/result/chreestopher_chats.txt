 mean*

 i just found a tut on google freeman, thanks though
 thanks buddy, I got it working , adding users to sudoers that is
 i forgot your name though
 lol
 freeman, thats who it was, thanks for the help
 me too, this time around for some reason things are clicking much better in my head than in the past when ive tried to learn to use linux
 exactly
 I myself am an IT professional, mostly experienced with windows sides of things including AD etc as well as general IT support for medical practices as well
 im trying to expand my knowledge because the government is giving out tons of money to train for healthcare IT profesions , and ive already got a bit of background in the field, would just love to go as deep down the rabbit hole as i can
 anyways, just felt i would give you guys a bit of an intro , its the least I could do in exchange for the support
 lol
 my end goal is to learn pentesting , as eventually i would like to get cissp
 as healthcare has a huge need for security in their technology ...
 so i plan on learning more advanced distros once I get comfortable
 im liking it so far because im really starting to look at things differently already, only a few weeks in, and my mind is seeing and thinking about things in a more logical way , or atleast it seems that way
 would anyone care to help me to get my sound up and running in my linux distro?
 can someone help me, im trying to get my sound to work, I load the alsa mixer and it shows the typical sources my card is capable of using, but when i turn the volume up, no sound comes out.... any ideas?
 anyone know of a good tutorial on gettng your soundcard to work with alsa in ubuntu? (preferably newb friendly)
 hd intell is the card acording to alsa, and VIA VT1708S is the chipset
