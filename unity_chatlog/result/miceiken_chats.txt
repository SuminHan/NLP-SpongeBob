But that's the CD it's booting from

 ActionParsnip: I downloaded it twice, ran 2 seperate disks
 ActionParsnip: no, I don't know how I do that
 ActionParsnip: They are the same.
 ActionParsnip: CD
 ActionParsnip: does it have anything to do with the drive im installing it to?
 ActionParsnip: no, default speed i take it
 ActionParsnip: I've checked the CD for defects, it says it's valid

 :P
 coz_: the server edition?
 coz_: so how does it work? download everything?
 stefg: so it's a bug? did you solve it somehow
 coz_: okay, I guess i'll try
 coz_: and it's reliable?
 stefg: is there some kind of option for default select?
 coz_: text install? like the default one then? :P
 okay coz_: trying now, this is for 11.04?
 stefg: okay im gonna boot it up and see how it looks
 no purple color here
 itt looks all black to me :P
 coz_ yes
 oh
 now its purple
 coz_: all the specifics come later, right?
 I pressed install instead of command-line install
 :P
 coz_: okay, thanks for your help
 stefg: you too :)
 Installing the base system now, so we'll see soon
 suppose I wouldnt had the issue in the first place if I used USB?
 I probably used 6 cds to now
 lol
 francesc1: I did on my server, and it ended in a disaster because I didnt do it properly
 francesc1: do the do-release-upgrade! :)
 francesc1: I did a sources.list update, then ran normal apt-get upgrade etc
 well, it fucked everything up
 Okay, new question: I have 2 harddrives, now the mini installer probably cleans out the one I selected, right? But the other one I want to format aswell, how do I go about to do this?
 sorry
 yohyoh: format it
 like remove all data
 yoyoned: yes, I plan to use it as a storage device, if it's possible I'd like to have it "merged" with the other harddrive
 yoyoned: not that big of a deal, what I've done earlier is just mounting it to a folder, and I'm okay with that, so well I need to know how to format it
 stefg: so I've come to the install part, one question tho, the LAMP server is just apache, mysql and php from aptitude in seperate packages?
 yoyoned: Okay, thanks :) i'll look it up
 After a fresh install, how do I set the root password? oO
 why not?
 bastidrazor: wont everyone have access to my server then?
 zeknox: thanks, I go it :)
 what, I thought apt was aptitude
 zeknox, hmm, I see.
 zeknox: while we're on the topic, isn't root the owner of /var/www?
 www-data?
 zeknox: oh okay, so how should I go about setting up data in there? or should I rather edit my apache config?
 zeknox: okay then
 How do I set prefered local ip?
 zeknox: I have all my ports forwarded to 192.168.10.104, I want the server to have this local ip, if I recall correctly there was I file I could edit for that.
 thanks
 what is /dev/sde1? When I start the GRUB boot loader it seems like there are like 20 OSes
 ejv: they're all 11.04
 ejv: probably because of all the installs i attempted? many says they are in recovery mode, and their dir is /dev/sde1
 can I remove them somehow? I just want this
 stefg: is this supposed to happen? whenever my server boots into the OS, the screen goes black, am I missing a driver?
 stefg: screen goes to inactive mode, the monitor - where I usually would be prompted for user/pw
 stefg: any idea?
 ActionParsnip: it's installed and everything
 ActionParsnip: it just goes black, I sshed in and edited the network interfaces, it apparently was something wrong, because I cant find it on my network...
 ActionParsnip: I have the feeling I'm missing some driver or something
 what is LTS and what is debian squeeze, lol
 can it be installed with the mini?
 so you guys have no idea how I can get my monitor up with this?
 :P
 GRUB works, then my monitor goes to inactive
 Dr_Willis: icant even see if im logged in
 can I override the network configs from grub?
 iceroot: my /etc/network/interface is setup incorrectly, and I whenever I boot my OS my monitor goes black
 I'm aware of that
 but I was able to ssh in
 iceroot: I started the OS in recovery mode, can I override the network somehow
 iceroot: yes, but first I gotta get in
 okay
 I fixed it
 stefg: this is weird, when I booted in in recovery mode the screen works
 Dr_Willis: the grub resolution is fine, it's when I've left Grub and the OS is booting
 zeknox: works now
 stefg: okay, let me google
 error: no alternatives for default.plymouth
 ill be back
 so
 apparently, plymouth is causing my monitor to go black, I tried the commands fro !plymouth and they just said there were no alternatives for default.plymouth
 http://pastebin.com/BHY4BwvB -- can anyone tell if this is wrong? When I use this it doesn't appear on the network, maybe the router still has lease time for the old ip
 komodo169: I can't tell, because obviously I can't ssh in, and Plymouth makes my monitor go black when booting (which is my other question, how to disable)
 komodo169: any idea?
 edbian: yes
 edbian: as i said to komodo169, I can't tell, because the plymouth splash screen makes my monitor go black(inactive), so I can't find out what's wrong
 edbian, think so yes, anyway to check? :D
 edbian: correct, after the GRUB boot screen it goes black
 No idea :)
 permanently
 it has to be done in GRUB loader?
 hi bindi
 edbian: Save the file and exit gedit. If you have to add kernel options that contain quotation marks, add them as such:
 what do they mean with kernel options
 edbian: but this: acpi_osi=\"Linux\"
 is that needed?
 oh
 doh
 thanks :)
 edbian: gonna try now, thanks :)
 edbian: seems like it's stuck on a screen with the "cursor" just blinking
 An Ubuntu 11.04 splash screen showed up for less than a second tho
 edbian: no, permanent solution by editing /etc/default/grub
 edbian: I booted into recovery mode, with root acess. The only thing I did was adding nomodeset to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.
 edbian: I did change the network interface also tho
 edbian: yes, is that wrong? :D
 hold on then I need to reboot into recovery mode again
 edbian: not all of them :D
 edbian: talking you on a second machine, yes. Seems like networking is disabled in the root recovery mode. Anyway, the options are "splash quiet nomodeset"
 edbian: 11.04 server
 still just the cursor, and a second of ubuntu splash screen oO
 edbian: still just the cursor, and a second of ubuntu splash screen oO - is this related to the network changes i did?
 edbian: oh doh forgot to do it this time
 edbian: yes I saved the file
 edbian: now it booted fine
 I am able to log in
 edbian: nope, it isnt
 edbian: eth0, eth1 and lo :D
 edbian: doesn't say any ip adresses so I guess not. I tried to ping this computer and it said "Network is unreachable"
 edbian: unknown instance: -- am i to specify eth0 ?
 edbian: Failed to bring up eth0
 edbian: "Don't seem to have all the variables for eth0/inet."
 wait
 I think I see it
 is it spelled address?
 edbian: Yes, my ip is 105 here now
 edbian: also I've spelled it "adress" is it "address"? :D
 edbian: now it works :D this machine is 105, a windows one
 edbian: Haha, good job. Maybe it's just be being plain stupid tho. I greatly appreciate your help! Thank you :)
 edbian: thanks again, I'll probably be back tho :D
 I need a good and simple FTP server, any suggestions?
 Problem: I just installed mysql-server and when I try to do 'mysql -u root' I get "Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'
 Problem: I just installed mysql-server and when I try to do 'mysql -u root' I get "Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'
 Hello, so I'm wondering about something, in my previous server setup the directory public_html used to be created for all users, what made that happen, is it an apache module or is it a file I changed and just can't recall it?
 Is there any way to search through all files for some text?
 okay
 :D
