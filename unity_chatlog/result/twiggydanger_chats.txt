 Why does gksu nautilis not do anything?
 Can someone please help me: Why does gksu nautilis not do anything?
 ohsix: oh ok thanks
 ohsix: I do want to run nautilis as root and "gksu natilus" does the same thing as "gksu nautilis": NOTHING
 ohsix: I want to run it as root because I have a folder with a shitload of files that I need to change ownership of and i don't want to do it one by one
 ohsix: so the -r will make it apply to everyting in the folder?
 ohsix: so i just need to do chown  username /path/to/folder -r and that will set me to owner?
 ohsix: that worked! thanks a ton.
