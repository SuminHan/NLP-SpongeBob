 hi, I've installed 11.04 this morning and I'm using Unity, I suppose that I've activated some type of keybind and now the bar at the left is always on
 I want it to appear and disappear
 how can I do that?
 Aikar, I don't know what I did!
 and I hate it there, it's distracting
 HerCury, what is ccsm ??
