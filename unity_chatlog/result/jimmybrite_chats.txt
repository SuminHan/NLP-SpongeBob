 Is there a reason why grub breaks my mbr? I tried instaling 11.04 like 6 times already, and I can't boot into linix or win7 at all, so I have to re-install 10.10 to fix my mbr so I can at least use my system.
 I tried that, but Im sort of a noob with grub, grub-install said something like aufs needed?
 I tried a clean install from cd, an upgrade from cd, an upgrade from 10.10 installed on my hd, and al of them meses up grub, this is insane, I've never had that happen before
 i'll be back later, when i'm trying to install 11.04 AGAIN, it'll be more helpful if I give you guys the exact error messages, it's something like device/partition not found
 <ActionParsnip> yeah but that also happens when I do a dist-upgrade dude
 bur yeah, md5ing the cd is a MUST, which I don't do all the time,
 yeah, it's grub2 and dual booting on my machine that seems to mess up, I tried to keep the old bootloader or installer the maintainers package, and both installed the same grub with deep white fonts? if that makes sense
 anyhow, i'll be back later, because i'm giving out symptoms blindly..
 Hi, i'm upgrading 10.10 (clean install+10.10 updates) to 11.04, I've tried before but grub2 seemed to have messed up my mbr, I dual-boot with windows 7, and never had any grub issues with previous ubuntu versions, so in the upgrade for grub-pc, should I keep the old grub (which has failed in previous install) or install the package maintainer's version, which has also failed previously.
 in the upgrade for grub-pc, should I install the package maintainer's version (all signs point to yes)
 I upgraded 10.10 to 11.04, I dual boot, and now I can't boot into ANY os at all, long story short, grub2 messed up my mbr something fierce, can anyone direct me the right way, i'm geting nowhere with the grub2 ubuntu documentation
 I'm also getting error : nosuch device, no such disk, need to load kernel first
 I upgraded 10.10 to 11.04, I dual boot, and now I can't boot into ANY os at all, long story short, grub2 messed up my mbr something fierce, can anyone direct me the right way, i'm geting nowhere with the grub2 ubuntu documentation, should I just reinstall grub2?
