 elzoog: new is bundled with good,new and improved stuff.
 Whats happening, isnt today
 Whats happening, isnt today 28^th April, or which time zone do canonical guys live in, ubuntu.com still promises Natty downloads from 28^th April, my update manager hasnt noticed any new distro, or am I the one in the wrong timezone?
 Hey guys, please help here. Has natty been released, or what is this talk on gnome3 vs Unity about, Am I behind something?
 JR0cket1: so natty aint released yet, so whats the countdown?
 JR0cket1: coz far as I live, today is 28^th april 2011
 JR0cket1: thats encouraging.
 Natty will revolutionalize Linux, seemingly it will bring some investors into open source market. The worst news is canonical will go fully business and if we're not lucky, the promise of ubuntu always being free might be broken.
 Shipit closed down!
 shmoolikipod: to upgrade, you meant, update showld translate to `sudo ate-get upgrade
 Ubuntu asks for a password to "Unlock my login Key ring" every time I login, what is up with that? Can I disable that?
 gratidude: yea, sometime that comes up and after key in the password, some wireless starts to connnect, but right now their is no wifi-hotspot around, I just enter the password and thats it. Please, how do I disable this, its silently annoying
 How is Natty, for those who have gotten their hard disks filled with it,  any major bugs I might wanna avoid coz I am dying to press that upgrade button on my Update manager
 Natty will definately take ubuntu on much greater heights. Canonical income will increse majorly due to their cloud-platforms-intergration coz soon we are gonna have many users.
 tanath: though I wish synapses would have had much plugins like gnomedo
 carandraug: should try out some plugins, you'll realy save alot of time for other things in yout linuxbox.
 tanath: what exactly does zeitgeist do, I have come acoss that several times but never knew its importance
 I dont need Unity, as long as its panel is not removable nor modifyable, that imposes a restriction I cant live with, Gnome give musch freedom.
 wow, seems like Natty is loaded with enough bugs, from no working wireless drives to windows with no borders, God knows if a broadband modem will work. Sorry guys, hope someone helps with your probs, sometimes its safe to hold that breadth for a while and give the new distro a try after two weeks or so
 I want to dist upgrade from the command line, any I dea what I can do?
 coz_, yea, apt-get dist-upgrade doesn't work.
 MrCraig, just that, simple english. Right click the file in question, select "Open with other application" and select an application you believe can handle that file type.
 Wow! Distribution upgrade, Calculating changes, really taking years ... Will I ever finish this upgrade process?
 11.04 is full of crap, reminds me of Karmic, the most bugged ubuntu release ever
