 natty is released?
 how hard is it to revert back to the 10.10 gnome?
 sagaci, okay, i haven't done the upgrade yet.
 sagaci, thanks though, i wanted to know before I did it.
 nonix4, yeah this is just netbook unity
 nonix4, which you can turn off when logging in
 wow my harddrive is making a scary noise from this update
 i hope it's not the end
 mah454, what is wrong with it
 mikebot, it installs in windows LIKE a program, but runs separately like an OS. No partitioning involved.
 mikebot, correct
 mikebot, no problem
 mah454, sure
 mah454, just use an image hosting site like imgur.com
 oh dear god why did i choose to upgrade now. the repos are so backed up...
 mikebot, are you trying to run one inside the other? or run the separately?
 escott, he might not know what a VM is, this is his first time installing an dualboot os
 phoenixsampras, just click the upgrade button in software upgrades
 mikebot, make a virtual partition (is that what it's called? i forget)
 you make it the same exact way
 mikebot, you make it the same exact way in a partition manager
 mah454, i gotta run, send it to compdoc or josephnexus
 mikebot, as far as I know. you can create them with any real partition manager
 mikebot, i gotta run, sorry
 oh man the upgrade is going so slow.  Is it just because everyone is connected?
 upon update to 11.04 i can't get desktop cube working. every time i try to start it, it breaks the gnome window manager
 I'm in 11.04 with unity off, and when i try to start desktop cube from compiz, my window manager dies and nothing works.
 ohsix, haven't solved the problem?
 ohsix, how do i at least restart the wm?
 robin0800, classic always used to use compiz...
 ohsix, nope... still nothing.
 Flynsarmy, I'm using classic, so unity should be off... hopefully
 Flynsarmy, i don't even have cube turned on, i just can't get my wm to re-appear
 well F. how do i get compiz working in unity? right now it just disappears everything.
 so how do i get my wobbly windows back?
 whenever i enable composite my desktop breaks
 actually no
 its just not wobbling.
 Jon4248, i check the box, enable opengl and composite, but nothing happen.s
 ohsix, how do i do that?
 ohsix, it's making me turn on composite and opengl
 Jon4248, GTX 460 768MB
 ohsix, i just upgraded today, everything was working an hour ago :p I have a GTX460 so i'm sure my card will support it
 ymasory, it seems to make everything lose focus in my experience, and then you have to log out to restart x so you can start metacity again
 ohsix, Jon4248  proprietary nvidia driver? I 've been using that
 ohsix, Jon4248 it says "active but not in use"
 ohsix, what is nouveau?
 ohsix, i don't think so, it's disabled in synaptic
 ohsix, although when i click on monitor in system it doesn't force me to use the nvidia applet, which is suspicious, but i was playing portal 2 in wine a few minutes ago
 mordof, yes just install the skidrow crack and run it with padsp wine portal2.exe from the directory
 ohsix, it's cracked because drm breaks wine, not because i dont own it. i bought it.
 ohsix, it's actually the recommended fix on winehq
 mordof, obviously no co-op with that setup, also if you choose to go that route, you'll also have to do winetricks glsl-disable in your portal folder with the exe in it, and it runs super smooth
 mordof, agree'd but I don't have time to play the co-op until summer, so i've got some time to work the bugs out :p
 mordof, haha sure, you might not even need the aforementioned illegal fix in 11.04, check winehq
 ohsix, what happened to the tab in appearence prefs that allowed you to turn on wobbly windows and such?
 ohsix, i had it in 10.10 :p
 ohsix, does using gnome classic disable compiz?
 grrr...
 i got wobbly windows working, but desktop cube still kills my theme, and whenever i restart classic gnome, my desktop setup is 2x2 instead of 4x1
 well dont ask me how, but somehow i got desktop cube working now.
 why do menu-items look so ugly when i right-click on them?
 wtf happened to the minimize to desktop applet for gnome?
 nvm. i'm stupid.
 lol KM0201
 xsinick, it's been released officially for a day, relax
 what key is KP5 in compiz?
 nvm. it's the keypad
 wow resizing windows the "normal" way with compiz doesn't seem to be working right.
 does anyone know how to make 'normal' window  size in compiz not suck
 window resize 'normal' sucks... how do i fix it?
 tanath, if you're not using classic probably
 tanath, you can choose "classic gnome" when you log in and it looks just like 10.04
 tanath, or 10.10 even
 tanath navigate to ~/Desktop either in the terminal or nautilus
 tanath, i'm not sure, I don't really like unity all that much. It probably has some kind of stacks on the dock though that you could throw them into (I really dont know)
 tanath, let me check
 tanath, nope 2.31
 tanath, nope 2.32.1 **
 tanath, you can install it from the repos though, i believe
 tanath, but it doesn't work with unity AFAIK
 tanath, you might find it worthwhile to wait then...
 tanath, I've been spending the last few hours fixing compiz, lol.
 jubei, I have compiz working. are you in classic or unity?
 jubei, does it say "activated but not in use" or is the little circle red?
 jubei, activated but not in use? that means it's working. but if the light is red, it's not working. I don't know how to solve the not-working problem myself, but i'm sure somebody here has some ideas
 jubei, thats how mine looks, and compiz is working for me.
 jubei, install ccsm
 jubei, sory compiz-config-settings-manager
 jubei, i was wrong again compizconfig-settings-manager sorry xD
 jubei, no problem, unfortunately i gotta run :( plenty of other people here to help though!
 i'm thinking about trying debian or arch
 ACameron, you're not _supposed_ to get errors :p
 tommylommykins, seems that way
 tommylommykins, I tried using it with unity and it broke unity until I restarted... I tried using it without unity ("classic desktop") and it works much better
 thegoodcushion, are you asking if they're going to remove it?
 thegoodcushion, just use "classic gnome" when you log in
 thegoodcushion, honestly, if it disappears I would switch distros, on the other hand it's very easy to install gnome
 uabn93, of course, if you update it internally
 why is classic gnome so ugly when i right click on things?
 Cporter, try installing 10.10 and then upgrading from within the OS?
