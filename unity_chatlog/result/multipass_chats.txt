 wow, 11.04 has iphone support, badass
 neckoox, yeah.. i had direct access to the root of it, access to the 3rd part apps, and access to the music.. amazing
 neckoox, so no longer need SSH to it
 neckoox, i think so.. so far i just tried playing it though.
 neckoox, cant atm lol, im at work and i already wasted an hour, sry
 neckoox, it works on live usb/cd, so done even need to instlal
 in 11.04 how do i change it so when i move the mouse cursor over the edge it changes workspace?
 in 11.04 gnome how do i make cursor flip workspace?
 in 11.04 gnome-- how do i make cursor over edge flip workspace or move windows to otherworspaces(compiz fusion settings used to let me do this in 10.10)?

 gnome was way better than unity

 sebsebseb, yeah i am, i tried using unity for a few hours.. hmm
 i dont think the "file menu bar" should be at the top for every window, very inconvenient imo
 ohsix, well i was excited about it, and i just dont know if i could ever use it now that ive seen it
 ohsix, reguardless, i like some of the additions to ubuntu 11.04 =) mainly iphone support
 ohsix, yeah already set to default.. maybe ill try unity again sometime.. kinda felt weird without a window manager
 ohsix, i had a opengl game going in unity and it didnt have a top bar to drag it around, and there was no icon to signify it was even open
