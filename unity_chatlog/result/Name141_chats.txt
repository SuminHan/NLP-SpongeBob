 How would you map out your windows shares?  I mean if you are going to play an MP3 from it with mpg321 ?  Do you use smb://192.../path/file.mp3 ?
 or is there some other way to see the windows shares again ? I forgot about ?
 Is there something else like super_pi you can use to benchmark the CPU and tell how fast it is instead of just stressing it ?
 Is there any real reason not to download and use the 64bit Ubuntu on a 4GB RAM system ?
 carandraug: I suppose it is, it's an Athlon II X4
 carandraug: Will the 64bit still have the 'make a startup drive' option for a USB stick ?
 carandraug: I guess I'd only lose a CD and some bandwidth if it doesn't.
 carandraug: while I wait on the 32bit to download..
 Is it possible to make a startup flash disk within windows without booting to a CD?
 Enekk: I downloaded the AMD 64 bit ISO and for some reason this machine wont boot with it
 carl-m: my new system doesn't have drives yet
 carl-m: was hoping to see hot it ran Ubuntu (live)
 carl-m: It just sits there black, can't move the mouse or anything
 Enekk: If I'm doing it over, I'm getting the 32bit
 I don't have the bandwidth to do it over and over
 Enekk: this machine is E2160
 Enekk: the new one without drives in it yet is Athlon II X4
 Enekk: maybe bad download ?
 Enekk: It's not really a graphical issue if the USB isn't responding and I can't get to the desktop lol
 Enekk: The "try/install" screen doesn't even come up before it scews up
 screws
 carl-m: I'll have to wait till about 3 AM then
 carl-m: 7:27 PM
 carl-m: that's hughesnet caps.
 carl-m: I suppose I could use the 32bit 10.10 on a USB stick for now to test the machines workability , sensors (temps) and all for now.
 carl-m: I suppose I'd only have 3.2 GBs of RAM
 of the 4
 Enekk: I just use UNetbootin to try the 64bit ISO ?
 Enekk: how would I know how much space I could tell it to save for saving across reboots ?
 Enekk: It's a 7.64 GB flash drive ( " 8 GBs " )
 Enekk: I told it 2000 MBs
 Enekk: seems to be taking all day on "filesystem.squashfs"
 aye
 Enekk: okie dokey it's moving again
 Enekk: I just want to make sure the motherboard isn't DOA , or processor, or RAM..
 Enekk: Before I go ordering a hard drive and DVD burner
 Enekk: the 'setting up persestince" is taking forever now
 Enekk: OK, so it's not 'hung' ?
 How do I install flash on AMD 64bit ?
 !flash
 !nvidia
 what's the nvidia package?
 nvidia-latest ?
 never mind I just got it from 'other drivers'
 jetole: how do I install it from the repos
 is there something to 'benchmark' the cpu rather than just stress it like stress --cpu 8 , ?
 How would I convert the processors bogomips in to "what it can do and how fast?"
