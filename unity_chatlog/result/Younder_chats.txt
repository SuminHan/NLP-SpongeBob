 My Ubuntu 11.4 install can't start the xmanager. It logs in and the fails to respond to aly key or mouse commands.I managed tu shut it down and start a xaw session. Any idea what has happened?

 It seems to be oonly the x manager I can run the apps and Datatbase etc are up
 Does 11.04 mess with .Xconfig ?
 robin0800, well where is the configuration?
 robin0800, I do have a proprietary NVidea driver, yes
 robin0800, Thanks I'll try
 Yes, seems safe mode works. But with the NVidea proprietary driver .nothing works. Not entirely sure it it is just me and that I have the right diagnosis yet..
 Hmm seems  the video controller and PCI controller both use irq 16 no wonder it fails.. (11.04 failed to start window manager correctly, nvidea card seemed the culprit)
 to get unity to work with nvide try sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
 It has some settings that might help
 lxs-makoto, dump or dd
 lxs-makoto, then dd
 nikop,  It's still there. You jsut have to access the grub menu
 Cassini_, Yes, there is a interrupt conflict. Both IDE scci0 and display want to use irq 16. Check with lshw
 nikop, This is a new grub version which behaves differently. Check the grub documentation
 Cassini_, I Have sent a bug report. Technically this should not happen as a separate demon  assigns the interrupts. I have just decided to wait to they have a fix..
 CryptKper, When you log in and click the user (but haven't entered the passwd yet) on the bottom line you can select classic
 CryptKper, Oh I see. Rightclick background. select change desktop background, on the first tab select classic
