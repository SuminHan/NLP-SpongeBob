 Natty looks really ... em different. I need to have my system monitor in the top panel. How do I do that?
 samtate Yeah I have a feeling you might be right.
 ohsix yeah I think Ill do that. Is there anything that Unity has for an advanced user of *nix systems that I should know about?
 ohsix think Ill install Gnome 3 and just give that a spin. I spend 95 % of my time in emacs and the other 5 in a term. This is just to much rainbows and ponies for me.
 Unity imho was a bigger mistake then Vista was fro Microsoft.
 ohsix true. I use ccsm extensively. I really need the 3D cube to work with the 3D windows due to the fact that I have 6 VM running all at once. Seems the not even Gnome will work with the cube now? Is this correct?
 ohsix I guess I just need some time. Seems not to long ago that anybody that was not lynx, bitchX etc was just "blinky" junk.
 n3glv what question is that?
 n3glv what question is that =P
 klunky999 windows will over write grub. Use a VM or install it first
 Oh SNAP one thing I hated with GDM (Gnome) was that I had to recompile it to work with Multiseating. Will Unity Multiseat??????
 How do I change the names of the icons on the dock bar. I have 6 firefox profiles. Now they all say Firefox Web Browser.
 No firefox 4

 Who are the core developers of Unity ?
 I mean "normal" linux and BSD list who does what ie http://www.debian.org/intro/organization#officers . I want to know who is the core team for Unity.
 I saw this happen to Red Hat back in the 90's...
 Is there anyway for me to get my 3D cube desktop back. I have a VM on each desktop.
 needlez what card and divers?
 needlez is it pre CUDA ?
 silentz0r Debian Squeeze is really nice ... ZERO blobs in the kernel now. Stable as heck etc. Don't go back to MS
 needlez that card is a good card in laptops. Also supports cuda. Don't see what there should be a problem
 needlez did you install the Nvidia drivers?
 needlez ahhh OK. You are using the VESA drivers then. If you Activate the Nvidia ones then your problems should be gone.

 cvs -d$CVSROOT checkout -rOPENBSD_4_8 -P src ports xenocara
 knifepoint thx.
 I was looking at the core Unity code the other night. Is there a reason that they are not doing this in C ? C++ doses not feel like Linux
 dellman they should be in the Mac stack
 dellman the divers you are using should be in mac80211 (kernel) and not in some  ieee80211 stack.
 ikonia maybe because a lot of the kernel work for that part of the stack was done by Me?
 ikonia by the way I am Onryo
 ikonia Ubuntu is a spin off of Debian. "unity" is just a windows manager. In fact We are using GNU/Linux with the flavor Ubuntu 11.04
