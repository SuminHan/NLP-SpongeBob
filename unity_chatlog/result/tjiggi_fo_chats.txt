 !gnome3 | Marsha||[a]
 Marsha||[a], that's what happened
 Marsha||[a], reinstall 11.04
 Marsha||[a], there's no way back. Read the ubottu factoid again. Just use a live CD to rescue your data and reinstall
 Marsha||[a], you can try but I cannot help you
 bruzer, can you paste the result of: sudo lshw -C Network
 bruzer, just tell me the name of the driver
 bruzer, and what are the values of "Broadcast" and "Multicast"?
 bruzer, it's all in the output of the -C Network command I asked you to run
 bruzer, and the driver listed in that output is the b43 you mentioned?
 bruzer, run: ifconfig     and tell me which device (eg "wlan0) has more than zero RX packets
 bruzer, ok, one of the others should also be showing packet throughput
 bruzer, what other devices (other than lo) are listed?
 bruzer, and you don't have an ethernet cable plugged in do you?
 bruzer, run: ifconfig wlan0
 bruzer, still nothing?

 nadar_, it creates a pseudo partition and lets you choose between windows or ubuntu at bootup
 nadar_, don't know what that is, sorry
 nadar_, if you have 210GB available I would strongly advise you to create a seperate partition and install ubuntu to that instead of using the windows/wubi alternative
 nadar_, you only need 10 or 20GB
 nadar_, if it hasn't started formatting yet, then yes you can quit

 Chilaquiles, which iso images?
 Chilaquiles, downloads
 Chilaquiles, is it an iso file you downloaded?
 then, if you downloaded it as "your_user_name" it should be in the downloads folder of your home directory
 Chilaquiles, you can search for it. Go to Applications, Accessories, Search for Files
 Chilaquiles, then sorry, but I can't help

 codingenesis, a job with intel or AMD.
 codingenesis, yes, the processor is part of the architecture
 ablaze, there's actually a warning on the wubi page about a problem upgrading from 10.04 to 10.10: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide
 ablaze, best is to uninstall wubi from windows (instructions in the link above) and reinstall 10.10
 ablaze, understood, but it breaks more than just grub
 jorek, that's his choice not mine
 !tab | jorek
 ablaze, I understand where it gets stuck, but I have no idea how to solve that. You might look in your log file viewer at messages and boot to see if there are any clues
 ablaze, the problem with using wubi is that not many people here use it, so not many know how to fix it :)
 ablaze, System, Administration
 ablaze, do you have a live CD?
 ablaze, boot up into a live session and look for the wubi install in Program Files (or wherever) and the logs will be in /var/log/messages and /var/log/boot. use the date and time to try find when your first problem boot happened
 ablaze, :)
 ablaze, if you go to Places, Computer you should find a "FileSystem" entry (NTFS) that includes your windows files
