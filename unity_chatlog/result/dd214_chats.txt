 My UPDATE MANGER reads: "New Ubuntu release '11.04' is available!
 Is there a way in Unity to open multiple terminals?  I have the terminal docked in taskbar, but if I want to open more than one terminal, I've got to use the Unity search to open a new terminal window...
 how do I find a file by Wildcard search from a terminal command?
 anyone use a CAC?
 Having trouble finding my CAC reader
 ActionParsnip, CAC = Common Access Card
 I'm slowly going through dmesg to find CAC, but no luck
 is there a way in 11.04 to disable Unity?  It appears to be causing problems with my VMWare Workstation
 ojii,  As of today, that menu at the bottom of the login screen is no longer available to me
 ojii, once I've logged in, where can I disable Unity?
 ActionParsnip how do I do that?
 I guess no one read where I stated that menu "Does Not" display from my login screen
 is there an alternative to Disabling Unity "Other than the login screen"?
 blackbit, thnx will verify
 Having trouble with 11.04 and VMware workstation, I can't create clones of existing VMs without workstation abruptly closing.  no logs
 what is a good app to play BlueRay "EVO" files?
 MarkSS I was losing my mind w/ Unity
 MarkSS logout, select your name on login and look at the bottom, there will be a menu.  Select "Ubuntu Classic" and you'll get your life back!
 mpeddi, I had some problems with 11.04 coming out of hibernate and screensaver
 mpeddi, I had upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04, big mistake, so I did a clean install of 11.04 and all is working
 mpeddi, I also had serious issues running VMware Workstation with Unity.  Each time I clicked the Unity menu, my VMWware would completely close in milliseconds.
 iceroot, what about 10.10 and 11.04 benchmarks?  Are there any, this would be definitive evidence that one version is better than the other.
 tomlin, yes most of us are
 tomlin, do you mean keeping my Gnome3 preference when logging in?
 tomlin, nvrmnd.. sorry, I force authentication
 Is there any software that I can use for Visio diagrams?
 Or when in doubt.. VM out!
