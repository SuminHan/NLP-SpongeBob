 how to send "ctrl + alt + f1" in vinagre?
 MaRk-I: i dont see that point in vinagre 0.5.1
 MaRk-I: hardy provides 0.5.1
 MaRk-I: as it seems i need a backport
 MaRk-I: libc6 dependency :(
 MaRk-I: i will try other vncviewers, thank your for your help
 its always a bad idea to copy something from apple
 Kindari: never touch a running system
 brokenupgraydes: chroot into the system and rund "sudo dpkg --configure -a"
 brokenupgraydes: if you can boot the normal system do that and run the command then you dont need a chroot
 Shoogy: netbook was a normal ubuntu with unity
 brokenupgraydes: pastebin
 macrossm: never touch a running system, so its your fault
 brokenupgraydes: make a backup of that file, then edit it and remove the string "version" from that line
 brokenupgraydes: also its a good idea to open a bug with that
 brokenupgraydes: sed s/^version// :)
 brokenupgraydes: and remeber the backup!!!
 macrossm: of course it has compiz
 macrossm: dpkg -l \*compiz\* | grep ^ii  says my natty has compiz
 vanguard: never touch a running system
 deeeed: macos is an os you cant run ubuntu on that
 !mac | deeeed
 boneseer: repair what exactly?
 boneseer: errors?
 muneeb: just remove old unused kernels
 muneeb: that is a great feature its not removing old kernels. what if the new kernel is not booting what will you choose then?
 poipoi: with some luck, lubuntu will run but more ram is a good idea
 poipoi: i am running ubuntu on 630mhz + 512mb ram (eeepc 701)
 DirtyDawg: gnome
 DirtyDawg: its the gnome from ubuntu 8.04, its running ok with 512mb ram and 630mhz, its possible to work with that machine (if not using fash/youtube)
 mattyh88: dpkg -l apache
 mattyh88: dpkg -l apache2
 mattyh88: if the line starts with ii, its installed
 mattyh88: and the binary is called apache2 not apache
 !ipod | santhu1984
 krad: cat /etc/issue
 terry: what should that command do?
 terry: not really
 terry: dpkg -i wants local deb-files
 terry: maybe you mean "sudo apt-get install packagename"

 MattAAron: yes
 cfc_{Pawpad}: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade   (not only upgrade)
 dios_mio: yes
 hw: does it say "hold"? you have to use dist-upgrade to get all updates
 LinuxHack3r: first try if it is working, "xrandr -s 1280x1024"
 LinuxHack3r: xrandr -q  is showing you what your card/monitor supports

 mza: unity is published with lgpl
 dustin_: not remove, just not used by default
 mza: #ubuntu-offtopic, #gnome
 mza: and yes there is but this is not the right place for that
 Alarcron: no its still disabled in the kernel because of a memory leak, you can only switch gpus with a reboot
 Alarcron: i a running a setuo here with nvidia ion and intel gpu (asus eeepc 1015pn) and i have to reboot to use intel or nvidia, live-switching is not possible (2.6.38)
 Alarcron: it should be fixed in 2.6.39
 pksadiq: someone posted a lauchpad url
 is there a way to put my pgp-key (signed mail) into keyring, so thunderbird is not asking everytime for my passphrase if i send a signed mail?
 Joric: uname is telling you what kernel is used, cat /proc/cpuinfo (lm means 64bit) tells what the cpu can do
 binox: any errors?
 binox: what vga you have?
 rgb247: with your backup
 rgb247: now you know why it is a bad ida to use the root account and also a bad idea not to have a backup
 rgb247: the explanation is that your files are gone forever you cant recover them (only if you do backups)
 rgb247: dont use root/sudo if you dont know what you are doing
 mastaofdisasta: no its not but if you are using network-manager this is the wrong place to setup something
 mastaofdisasta: service

 KM0201: i dont get what you want
 KM0201: yeah just stop your strange conversation here
 sss314: why you want to do a fresh install?
 stefg: not really
 sss314: 1. never touch a running system, so why you need an upgrade? 2. make a backup of /home (not only because of an upgrade), 3. just ran the upgrade manager
 Halzen: that is not true
 Halzen: "most dist-upgrades cause problems" means hat more then 50% of all upgrade may break the system and that is of course not true
 sss314: dont make a fresh install, its useless
 Halzen: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade is of course not the recommend way to upgrade
 Halzen: the update-managaer has special pre/postinst scripts
 Halzen: if you just change your /etc/apt/sources.list and do sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  then maybe its broken often but that case we dont care, we support the update maager
 Halzen: so please dont tell peolpe that upgrades are broken very often
 ChessTeach: its the same performance as software-raid
 ChessTeach: if you dont want a dualboot with windows (and windows is also on raid) there is no single reason to use fakeraid
 ChessTeach: there are only contras with fakeraid
 ChessTeach: there is no need to buy a hardware-raid-controller, just use softwareraid (not fakeraid)
 ChessTeach: hardware-raid is only needed on servers
 ChessTeach: i said there is no reason to use fakeraid
 ChessTeach: softwareraid is ok for desktop-machines, no need to buy a hardware-raid-controller (150€)
 ChessTeach: remeber one thing, raid is NOT a backup, so why you need a raid?
 ChessTeach: so you want raid0 (strip)
 ChessTeach: if one drives fails, everything fails
 ChessTeach: what about an ssd instead of raid0?
 ChessTeach: solid state disc (flash drive)
 ChessTeach: then build a software raid 0
 ChessTeach: no
 ChessTeach: you can build a software raid everytime
 ChessTeach: you can build a software-raid in an already installed system
 !raid | ChessTeach
 !google | Halzen
 ChessTeach: but remeber again, if one drive fails in raid0 your files are gone
 spyhermit: losing all data is worth to mention again, dont you think?
 spyhermit: it was the second time
 thevor: yes
 chotaz: chmod -R
 chotaz: but you dont want 777, correct?
 Halzen: noone is forcing you to use unity
 roasted: use the alt+f2 method please
 roasted: ubuntu-bug packagename
 roasted: create a bug against the package with the wifi-driver
 roasted: creating a bug against hardware is not a good idea
 roasted: if that is the package, yes
 roasted: what is the bug exactly?
 roasted: its a driver issue?
 booginga: do you get errors at the installation?
 booginga: or errors when starting?
 booginga: i guess its a good idea to open a bug about the missing files/libs
 booginga: ubuntu-bug packagename
 booginga: thats the easiest way to get it fixed
 booginga: just run "ubuntu-bug packagename" its a wizzard for creating a bug
 !ot
 kryl: are the crypt-moduls build for your current kernel?=
 kryl: but that is only the lvm not encrypted, correct?
 kryl: #ubuntu-server

 kryl: on my crpyted-system its "dm_crypt"
 ghostnik11: never touch a running system
 ghostnik11: and why you need an upgrade?
 ghostnik11: "better" is always a personal opinion
 ghostnik11: as i said, never touch a running system :) the most important sentence out there
 miceiken: network config in grub?
 dd214: its maybe because of 2.6.38 but not because of 11.04 (cgroups patch)
 miceiken: /etc/networks/interfaces has nothing to do with a black screen
 miceiken: sure
 miceiken: sudo vim /etc/networks/interfaces
 miceiken: or use a live-cd if the system isnt booting anymore
 zeknox: gksudo for gedit
 Ringish: only with your backup
 Ringish: no
 Ringish: not by default
 Ringish: there is no restorefunction, backups can be done of course from the terminal
 Ringish: no, as i said
 amstan: i cant see dependencies not from haskell
 eiriksvin:
 amstan: that will kill your system syncing everything grom sid
 amstan: enable the sid repo install the haskell part and remove the sid-repo or use apt-pinning
 amstan: yes as ActionParsnip said its not a supported way but should work in this case
 amstan: broken?
 ChR0n05: you can use cat foo | grep bar   too  its available but stupid
 ChR0n05: sudo su is the wrong way
 ChR0n05: doesnt matter if some "noob" peolpe suggest sudo su
 ChR0n05: i have seen tutorial using cat foo | grep bar too
 ChR0n05: real tutorials suggest sudo vim instead of sudo/gksudo gedit :)
 ChR0n05: but back to topic, sudo su is wrong because its setting the environment wrong

 mang0: you can boot isos with grub2, also you can put the iso on an usb-drive
 mang0: is there already something running on the pcß
 mang0: you want to install ubuntu to your pc, correct?
 mang0: and why not using a cd or a usb-drive?
 mang0: you are using fakeraid?
 mang0: so the installer is not detecting your hard drives?
 chrome_: cat /etc/issue
 !unity | chrome_
 mang0: yes you can install ubuntu without burning a cd or use a usb-drive but why go the hard way?
 mang0: just burn a cd or use usb
 mang0: then you one of them
 mang0: its not the fault of a failed burn that the live-cd isnt detecting your drives
 mang0: because you are using fakeraid or your controller is not supported or your harddrives are not detected from the bios
 mang0:  thought about using ubuntu 11.04 with better hardware support?
 mang0: is your bios detecting the harddrives?
 Metroshica: unzip filename

 Somelauw: its enabled
 Somelauw: the keycombo for restarting is working fine on 10.10 and 11.04
 Somelauw: others are not testet
 Somelauw: go to tty1 and press alt + print + m  and it will show you the memory dump
 Somelauw: testet on 11.04
 Somelauw: if i am correct its only working on tty and not gnome-terminal
 Somelauw: the memory dump is showing you what is going on on your memory
 Somelauw: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/315503  maybe have a look here?
 Somelauw: who said that?
