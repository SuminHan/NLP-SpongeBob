 hi there
 i'm trying to install latest 11.04 from a usb key and apt-get fails not finding the cdrom - tried 'cdrom-detect/usb=true'
 was the same with 10.10 :/
 KM0201, If you get "Incorrect CD-ROM detected" error on detection stage, reboot, press F6 and then ESC to go to manual boot line editing, and add the option 'cdrom-detect/try-usb=true'
 found on ubuntu.com
 no the regular one
 KM0201, was the same w/h 10.10 my personal laptop & another usb stick
 anyway i can bypass apt to check for the cdrom and install package from online repositories?
