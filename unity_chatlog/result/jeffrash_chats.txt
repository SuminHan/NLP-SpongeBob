 Why can't Ubuntu keep Broadcom B43 support stable?
 STA doesn't work in 11.04
 It worked fine me both 10.x versions
 is there anyone around that can explain why ubuntu can get the broadcom b43 support consistent?
 I understand thanks
 But why does support come and go every time
 it works in one release and doesn't two releases later then it works for two more and stops again
 How do I get this issue higher on Ubuntu priority list?
