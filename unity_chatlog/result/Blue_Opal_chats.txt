 stfollower: apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
 stfollower: you can then switch between them on the login screen
 on the login screen there will be a button, you can swtich between gnome and kde
 np
 sdgdsffsd: try kde
 nope, you can install both and switch between them
 as i said it will not replace gnome
 what do you mean how long?
 as far as i know ubuntu will now use unity, which has some gnome components
 so no it isnt, 11.10 will probably be similar to whats in 11.04 which is unity
 not sure about that, if you like gnome 2 you should look at using a distro that hasnt switched to gnome 3, there are probably quite a few out there
 Rehan: true but there is not much of an alternative
 openoffice wasnt much better
 Rehan: openoffice was defiantly more stable but it doesnt quite measure up compared to microsoft office, which is a disappointment, thats still a major problem with linux os, there is much in the way of an office app yet, hopefully things will change
 Rehan: Yeah defiantly, the actualy operating system is world class but i often notice that applications are never quite as good, still it is impressive that they are free and dependant entirely on donations
