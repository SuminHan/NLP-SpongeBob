 hi all
 i'm having trouble while trying to mount to software database
 can anybody help with that?
 i used to mount -t cifs -o user= etc. etc.
 it says
 mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on
 mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on //yazilim.cc.itu.edu.tr/yazilim,
        missing codepage or helper program, or other error
        (for several filesystems (e.g. nfs, cifs) you might     need a /sbin/mount.<type> helper program)
        In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
        dmesg | tail  or so
 ok. sorry
