 hello all
 i have a quick question
 i recently had my laptop stolen and i am very mad about it.  i dont have money to buy a new one.  but i do have money to buy something cheep.  i am looking at a rack mount server from pacificgeek.com.  a dual 3.06 zeon.  now i know server will run fine on that but will desktop run fine on it with being able to use it for daily activities?
 internet, viewing pics, and going as far as recording music
 has anyone here ran ubuntu desktop on a rack mount server?
 cheapie, would you think there would be any issues?  i would assume it would be straight foward.  just not sure
 ZaReason is a person on here?
 cheapie, ok.  i will check them out.  i recently had my laptop stolen and i dont have the money to replace it.  but i have found some cheap 3ghz xeon servers that i think will work for me
 cheapie, do you think a dual 3ghz xeon 4gb ram would be comparible to a core duo 2.5ghz 4gb ram?
 basic everyday use.  and music recording
 music recording is done through a usb box not onboard sound
 ludican, amazon had a lenovo 15.6 core duo 2.2ghz 4gb ram 250gb hdd for $300 recert.  thats a pretty good deal imo
 pacificgeek.com also has a 12.1 core duo 1.86ghz 512k ram 80gb hd off lease for $170.  thought about getting that myself.
 slinger2519, i believe you need the ircd package from synaptic package manager.  then there should be info online on how to set it up.  tho getting it on a major network takes some major internet speed
 Angelic, does it have a serial number or any kind of sticker on the back?
 Angelic, do you have any numbers off that card?
 Eyes_Only, what makes airo so great?
 bull9408, system > preferences > sound > input and make sure the right intup is selected and it is not on mute
 bull9408, try robins idea of alsamixer.  didn't know that was there.  mic option is on the end
 bull9408, any vocal sound at all
 bull9408, did it ever work?  have you changed anything?  is the connection clean and finger oil free?
 bull9408, make sure the hardware tab has the right info under sound preferences
 bull9408, let me read up.  is it a laptop?
 bull9408, you still here
 bull9408, have you seen this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1408506 looks promising
 bull9408, there is also the option in post #5 that you can try
 bull9408, are you on 11.04
 bull9408, is the volume on the mic up at 100%
 bull9408, maybe http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1651779 post #6.  just make sure to back up files before you edit them
 bull9408, what does    lspci | grep Audio     get you?
 bull9408, type lspci | grep Audio in terminal and paste the results
 bull9408, also,  under alsamixer hit f4 and make sure the input is on internal mic.  Does the mic 3.5mm headset plug option work?
 bull9408, do you have sound comming from the speakers?
 bull9408, also, under alsamixer press f4 and make sure the input is internal mic
 bull9408, try switching it to front mic then back to internal
 how can i change the background of the log in screen. i think i am just overlooking it.
