 hi all
 I need help with configuration of two monitors - I have newest Ubuntu and NVIDIA GPU (drivers installed) - I have to monitors, they are wirking, but... second monitor is in, lets say, horizontal mode, is there an option in setting to turn it 90 degrees?
 *vertical I meant
 In TwinView, can I rotate only one monitor by 90 degrees?
