 axisys: use manual partitioning, use extended ones, that sets up lvm
 exchgr: I did and switched back to gnome
 exchgr: under powerbutton > set default session > gnome-classic
 axisys: best, yes, more options there
 axisys: should, if you choose manuall partit. and then set up extended partitons, that will be done with lvm, also if you use default > whole disk, it's lvm
 axisys: the alternate gives more options, though
 axisys: no, boot is under root in default unless you use encryption
 axisys: so is home
 yes
 CoolCoder: switch back to gnome
 CoolCoder: : under powerbutton > set default session > gnome-classic
 CoolCoder: : then re-login
 CoolCoder: : right top, there should be a symbol to power down..
 CoolCoder: : ..systemsettings, loginscreen
 CoolCoder: : :)
 agonzalez: logout to terminal, try to run : sudo nvidia-xconfig, restart gdm (sudo service gdm restart)
 lucas-arg: seems kernelpanic, check your bios setting an rebuild intramfs
 lucas-arg: make sure you can access grub's menu, and cd into boot and do : sudo updateinitramfs -u of your current kernel
 lucas-arg:good aproch, maybe enable grub's beep and have a loonger timeout, so you can easy use an older kernel, case problem resists
 lucas-arg:(/etc/default/grub)
 lucas-arg :  (/etc/default/grub) *
 lucas-arg :  beep and longer timeout can make choosing other kernel easier,case ongoing panics
 lucas-arg :  not occuring in my vm
 lucas-arg :  ups, uname -a and lsb_release -a
 evilsushi: no, lucid is lts
 !lts
 lucas-arg :  cat /proc/version another place to look
 fsvieira: it's undeer the powerbutton > systemsettings > loginscreen
 lucas-arg :  32 then
 karlo: depends, out of gdm ? or logout from what ?
 karlo: logout or exit or ctrl-D
 karlo: you want to shutdown from commandline ?
 karlo: sudo shutdown -h now, or sudo service gdm stop to just get to the commandline
 karlo: sudo logout >userHere>
 NyvenZA: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27668927/gnome
 NyvenZA: a link on howto switch back to gnome
 NyvenZA: ic, second, changing it
 NyvenZA: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27668927/gnome.txt
 !details | Kevin147
 NyvenZA: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm && sudo service gdm start
 NyvenZA: so ?
 !yay | NyvenZA:
 Macer: look in the forum
 Macer: I don't have experience with it, also #ubuntu-server or #httpd might be places to ask
 Macer: server-related channel
 !ask | A_J
  A_J: you can use the updatemanager, and won't need lucid's cd then, just internet
  A_J: rephrase please
 mateobur: use synaptics to find best mirror
  A_J: ah, yes quite far, but natty comes with unity and some software is gone btw. changed, but that's still a good refrence, why not stay on lucid ?
 Nyromith: not planned, netbook will disappear
 ActionParsnip: the question was if a lucid manaual will still fit for natty, I already answered it
  A_J: ah, yes quite far, but natty comes with unity and some software is gone btw. changed, but that's still a good refrence, why not stay on lucid ?
  A_J: yes, basically, as said some soft has changed, for info look up chanelog natty, there is a bunch on the net, or simply stay with lucid and test natty in a vm for now
  A_J: hard to predict, some people have trouble, the majority obvoiusly not, or the channel would be overcrowded from it
  A_J: ask if trouble
 :)
 Browser: natty is released, and can be d/l 'ed
 !download | Browser
 Browser: ic, open synaptics, use find fastest server
 Browser: you can ping all repos under sources
 Browser: what happens if you try ?
 !headers | CQ
 CQ: once you done it, next will be pulled as dependency, too, yes
 Browser: sudo apt-get clean && sudo dpkg --configure -a && sudo apt-get update
 acidflash: put it in rc.local
 acidflash: btw can also set squid to start in daemon-mode
 TrentonAdams: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27668927/gnome.txt
 Browser: doing now ?
 Augustuen: you could alter it's nice
 !nice | Augustuen
 A_J: irc bot, either c++ or phython I GUESS, #ubuntu-offtopic will know
 Browser: from the time, I can tell you didn't use synaptics to find your best mirror, natty is up and fine
 vibhav: great , bakshish ;)
 scorch2: flux is another windowmanager for x
 !flux
 scorch2: http://fluxbox.org/
 Augustuen: please ask for pm, I almost have overseen it; with nice you can set how much cpu time a process can access, yes
 man nice
 Browser: nice if it works then, and mind changing your sources, fastest mirror can safe a lot of time
 mikebeecham: nvidia I guess ?
 mikebeecham: you can activate the recommended from the jockey-gui, then have to stop gdm and run : sudo nvidia-xconfig, then start gdm again
 mikebeecham: the gui listing available drivers, it's called jockey-gtk
 mikebeecham: see above, xconfig...
 mikebeecham: you can activate the recommended from the jockey-gui, then have to stop gdm and run : sudo nvidia-xconfig, then start gdm again
 A_J: not recommened, either use pae or a fresh install, see :
 !pae
 mikebeecham: see above, xconfig...
 Guest53463: or ctrl-h in nautilus
 A_J: it's a specialised kernel to adress more ram, the server-kernel also delivers it
 mikebeecham: you can activate the recommended from the jockey-gui, then have to stop gdm and run : sudo nvidia-xconfig, then start gdm again
 mikebeecham:stopping gdm (logs you out!) sudo service gdm stop , start
 mikebeecham:before they won't be used, you kept asking that
 mikebeecham:and ran sudo nvidia-xconfig ?
 A_J: yes ?
 A_J: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade   (new kernel needs reboot), then try again
 Goliath: can happen, yes
 !gnome3 | Goliath
  Goliath: fine in my vm, though, own risk
 A_J: that should make it possible, yes
 A_J: sudo apt-get install linux-generic-pae linux-headers-generic-pae
 A_J: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade   (new kernel needs reboot), then try again
 A_J: yes, to avoid such, checkout ksplice
 A_J: it's in repo and can be used free
 !info ksplice
 arnab: triplegears
 A_J: what do you mean with paid ? free to use
 !info ksplice
 A_J: np, have less reboots ;)
 !info compiz | A_J
 A_J: sudo reboot
 yes
 mattyh88: can
 mattyh88: sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
 mattyh88: the whole installation is complete with repos first, not all language fits on the cd
 A_J: what do yozu want to restart ? x ?
 A_J: close and reopen ? makes no sense, or the desktop (aka x ?)
 A_J: once you set up ksplice properly, there is no more reboot needed for kernelupdates, a reboot is a reboot, cold would mean "pull the powerline" (don't do that)
 A_J: http://www.ksplice.com/uptrack/using
 :)
 user82: yes, but the major jump was lucid
 (upstart)
 user82: the old sysinit was improved , so there is more in parallel going on at boot, that did the trick
 user82: consider least lucid, if that's a factor for you, stable, less bugs, long supported
 mattyh88: check in synaptic if your desired language is fully installed, then re-try
 mattyh88: also sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade may be of use, another thing, can I pm you ?
 user82: your choice, dist-upgrade should be no problem
 jmcantrell_: on the t420 lucid is fine, though it's a mate's box
 jmcantrell_: not that I new, the touchpad might need some extra work
 knew*
 whomie: lÃ¶le
 whomie: rather a question for ##linux, ubuntu support here
 nexus6__: #ubuntu-de
 nexus6__: can pm me, if you want
 !details | Arrarita
 isibilir: use jockey-gtk
 isibilir: sudo jockey-gtk
 isibilir: choose recommended, activate, and ..
 isibilir: stop gnome, do a : sudo nvidia-xconfig, start gnome
 !pm | isibilir
 qin:nice, thank you for guidind isib.
 guiding*
 qin: it's about nvidia driver and nvidia-xconfig out of x
 Enissay: can try, pm me
 ymasory: you mean just default gnome ? yes.. should be a factoid, in between
 ymasory: you just want gnome, but no unity , or do I get you wrong ?
 Blackcamaro8: dependening on needed services, just log out desktop or even use another runlevel
 ymasory: ic, I'm not fit in unity, sry, can't help there
 Blackcamaro8: you can stop the desktop, if you  just need a commandline, saving ressources
 !runlevel
 Blackcamaro8: might be some friggle then, as many services, like networking, depend on other ones
 Blackcamaro8: you can go to init 1, for instance, and start network manually there
 Blackcamaro8: (logs you out !) sudo init 1 , there choose netroot
 Arphetic: on my gnome it's working great, but you can still choose any surface you like...
 ParkerR: try sudo os-prober
 Ah, Jordan_U, haven't seen
 termitor: edit /etc/default/grub as root, then sudo update-grub, can use a lower resolution and maybe no splash
 termitor: can you boot safemode ?
 termitor: press left shift when grub starts to lood, try recoverymode, usually second entry
 load*
 termitor: so you get just no picture, but a safetywarning from your monitor ? you will need another medium aka usb or cd then
 termitor: which OS are you currently talking from ? ssh on the broken one installed ?
 termitor: which OS are you currently talking from ? ssh on the broken one installed ? please answer to questions :)
 termitor: usb will rather work, no way to boot without monitor and ssh in ? fresh install ? use another monitor ?
 Newbiehere: same, it's general 64 bit, intell fine, too
 beanstalk: sudo update-manager -d  tells ?
 !!upgrade | beanstalk
 beanstalk: which version it suggests ? natty (11.04) or even further ?
 !who | beanstalk
 beanstalk: either can set the update-manager to prompt for new releases or go by http://paste.ubuntu.com/602553/ as mentioned above
 beanstalk: is your system updated/graded ?
 beanstalk: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
 kesi: what does : sudo ifup eth0 inet dhcp     repeat ?
 beanstalk: never heard of that error, try from single mode, repair broken packages, if that doesn't help, choose another server
 beanstalk: single-mode is tried ? sudo synaptic > sources > choose downloadserver
 kesi: ?
 kesi: sudo ifup wlan0 eth1  ?
 kesi: so for some reason it appears the drivers for your NIC's are missing, can you pastebin the part of lspci telling about the NIC ?
 forevertheuni: (!logs you off, so first read) sudo init 1 >choose repair broken p.. , then choose root : sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, sudo service gdm start
  kesi: 8139, absolutely common, are there more than just the two  realtek and wireless ?
 kesi: you connect via dhcp ?
 kesi: one more try :
 kesi: sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
 kesi: add a block :
 kesi: auto eth0
 iface eth0 inet dhcp
 kesi: two lines, save interfaces, then sudo networking restart
 kesi: two lines, save interfaces, then sudo service networking restart*
 kesi: are you already reinstalling ?
 !ics | balt11t
 kesi: so that was all done to the wood, well , good luck
 kesi: It's fine, and a very common hardware
 kzman: sure
 r00ter: attach to ubu-box, boot ubu, sudo os-prober
 kzman: is there an entry in fstab ?
 !fstab
 Jordan_U: I know, if it's found ..
 r00ter: first grubs needs to find the os, sudo update-grub then appends it to grub; fstab lets you automount your win-partitions , if desired to be used in ubu
 Rehan: depends ..
 Rehan: either your usb is big enough, than can clone hd with dd, or use an approach like remastersys for a live system
 Rehan: no, if that goes wrong might have to, but often that works, if usb-boot is supported by box
 Rehan: to be on the safe side, should do it from a live cd
 Rehan:yes, else can de-plug internal and let supergrubdisk repair it
 Rehan: no idea
 Rehan: ##java
 Barridus: setup cron
 !cron
 Barridus: ah, that's not the rss-reader, but microblogging, yes there is a tab under settings on how often to refresh
 Barridus: which app are you using for chatting ? pidgin allows, and I use twitter in browser, so it just goes faster than I read, without further tags
 Barridus: I know, but not where it's config is stored
