 why is ubuntu 11.04 not out yet?
 is there some delay?
 ayecee: sure it is
 ayecee: 42 minutes in to the 28th
 ayecee: and the CST will be the 28th in 18 minutes
 they'd better hurry up
 is it out yet??
 I'm running the 11.04 livecd and my wireless doesn't work
 the interesting thing is that it does work in debian squeeze, but not debian wheezy (which would have more similar packages to natty)
 how might I go about diagnosing the problem?
 is it possible to remove the ugly sidebar and replace the top-left unity button with a more traditional gnome menu?
 bazhang: but I kinda like other parts of this interface
 bazhang: I just don't like the lack of a real menu and the sidebar is just too colorful
 my close, minimize, and maximize buttons are on the wrong side of the windows too
 somehow I think ubuntu's probably made the first left-handed window manager
 didn't know that was possible
 Dr_Willis: what else does that?
 what's wrong with my wireless? http://imagebin.org/index.php?mode=image&id=151486
 that seems to happen in any recent kernel
 what's going on here: http://imagebin.org/index.php?mode=image&id=151493
 I've been having trouble with my wireless card across all distributions; It just doesn't seem to want to "activate"; my card: http://imagebin.org/index.php?mode=image&id=151486 me playing with my card: http://imagebin.org/index.php?mode=image&id=151493
 you know what's even cooler about this wireless problem?  Is that both my internal and usb wnic's behave exactly the same
 http://imagebin.org/index.php?mode=image&id=151499
 botcity: trying to make my wireless work
 botcity: the best part is that that usb card seems to work on other computers
 it's that "0: acer-wireless" soft block that seems to be causing all sorts of hell
 botcity: umm, no, but I guess; which ones?
 botcity: that usb wireless card is on the list of supported cards
 botcity: my screenshots have hwinfo --wlan for both cards
 but I have the rt2500usb Linksys USB 54G and an Atheros 9285
 both have kernel modules loaded and both work in kernel 2.6.32 (debian squeeze)
 it seems like there must have been some regression
 botcity: I'm also browsing through these guides and they seem mostly completely irrelevant
 botcity: my screenshots would suggest so; yes
 botcity: http://paste.ubuntu.com/602834/
 botcity: whenever I try to do anything with either interface I'm told "network is down"
 what that actually means I'm clueless
 botcity: and I'm currently at a loss on how to find more useful information
 botcity: on why two supposedly supported cards both aren't working because of what looks like some kind of system-wide soft block
 botcity: I'd also be willing to wager that if I grabbed ubuntu 10.04 or something to that effect, it'd probably work
 botcity: Acer One 721-3574
 botcity: only two distributions have worked so far: debian squeeze, and some chromium nightly build
 botcity: opensuse 11.4 failed, debian wheezy failed, fedora 10 failed, and ubuntu 11.04 fails

 pindropper: that worked :P
 pindropper: shut him down real fast
 Laggg: metacity --replace
 Laggg: of course it did
 botcity: thoroughly interesting...
 botcity: OH MY GOD!
 botcity: http://imagebin.org/151505
 botcity: your google-fu is strong
 botcity: this acer_wmi needs to be removed from all the distributions
 I need to open up bug reports everywhere that it should be blacklisted
 ActionParsnip: how is this done in ubuntu?
 I have just installed ubuntu after playing with the livecd for a bit
 All the sudden it feels like I have no 2d/3d acceleration and overall performance seems much reduced
 I think I was actually booting from the external harddrive than from the installed systemd
 ActionParsnip: Radeon HD4250
 ActionParsnip: radeon appeared to be running upon installation
 then ubuntu suggested I install fglrx
 since radeon performance was terrible (which is unusual for this card), I thought, meh, I guess...
 I think performance has gone down slightly after installing fglrx
 I was running debian wheezy beautifully before this (other than growing problems with borked packaging)
 ActionParsnip: well I do... but I fear there's no 2d acceleration
 ActionParsnip: lspci -k tells me fglrx is loaded, and glxinfo tells me I have direct rendering and that my vendor string is ATI...
 ActionParsnip: this is quite unusual
 ActionParsnip: but I swear that video performance is terrible
 ActionParsnip: I had 2d acceleration on the livecd
 ActionParsnip: surprisingly, there's a bunch of new packages... all perl related it appears.. and one for apt
 ActionParsnip: is universe and metaverse not enabled during installation I gather?
 ActionParsnip: clean install; haven't even gotten a chance to mount my real /home
 ActionParsnip: anyway, I'll try rebooting I guess
 ActionParsnip: much better
 this makes me slightly uncomfortable: http://paste.ubuntu.com/603119/ ; how might I re-enable root?
 I want to have a more traditional su/sudo setup (closer to how debian is setup)
 The idea that knowing the password of the restricted user allows you to elevate priveledges is a disgusting idea, I'm sorry
 geekorama: if you're asking about exchange or something like that, I can't help you :P
 red2kic: that looks interesting... I just abandoned a bogged down and semi-broken apt on wheezy
 red2kic: well, I was trying to do things like installing python 2.7 system-wide, which wheezy is supposed to accomplish (eventually)
 but it didn't work out well
 red2kic: so I played with the ubuntu livecd (hearing that this 11.04 was just released), and it had all the package versions I wanted (plus this PPA concept looks pretty cool, and I found myself stealing ubuntu packages frequently, which probably contributed to my package-management-meltdown)
 red2kic: I know; it was great until I changed repositories and did the (surprisingly) fatal safe-upgrade
 Trueman: my hardware keys work, which is surprising considering acer-wmi is broken on all aspire one's
 red2kic: I already switched to gnome with no effects and switched to clearlooks
 red2kic: might as well just use squeeze in that case
 red2kic: 2.6
 red2kic: I'm pretty ok with this, it at least looks somewhat like debian so far; I just don't like this concept of what a priveledges user is in ubuntu
 and want to re-enable something more traditional
 see, the live-cd worked how I wanted
 and now all the sudden it changes during install
 pretty deceptive I think...
 I got quite a few surprises thrown at me after installing actually
 red2kic: that was the plan; more stable than wheezy (at this point) and I could probably un-ubuntu-ifity it pretty easily... or so I thought
 red2kic: I had wheezy...
 red2kic: the problem is you can't just go from 2.6 to 2.7 that easily...
 lots of components depend on python and you need to solve lots of dependencies making an upgrade like that
 red2kic: I had it basically half-way done
 nothing was broken; but apt was severely confused
 I tried to have aptitude make a automagic proposal for me: it included uninstalling gnome
 I think glibc was in there too in the list of packages to uninstall
 I thought "hmm, I'd better jump ship before this blows up in my face"
 red2kic: if this doesn't work out; that's what I'll end up doing :)
 red2kic: I do already miss not having the firefox branding :P
 red2kic: I know
 red2kic: I thought it was amusing "iceweasel"
 I wonder if I can't switch that around too
 shouldn't be hard at all
 red2kic: all the sudo was confusing me; I've set the root password...
 red2kic: and #bash told me that that's not a bash question and that I should probably go back to #ubuntu :P
 ajdonnison: that's the one; thanks
 style question: how do I remove the padding from the taskbar buttons in the top-right?
 ajdonnison: should I have to re-log in? now I'm not asked for a password at all when I sudo (rather than the expected behavior: being told that that's no allowed"
 ajdonnison: I appreciate it
 jozefk: see? nobody likes unity
 jozefk: I switched to gnome-classic
 jozefk: you can log out and then switch in gdm3
 steve1: I think it's just it's a bad idea gone wrong, plain and simple
 how can I remove the padding from the taskbar icons in the top-right? (making it look like every other gnome environment I've experienced prior to now)
 jozefk: aptitude install ccsm?
 steve1: umm, i think this is still 2.32 or something
 steve1: roger that ^
 steve1: gdm3
 steve1: the login manager thingy
 glacia: what's the output?
 glacia: my guess is that you might need to install vc runtimes
 soreau: not neccessary with wine
 glacia: and what's the output when you do "wine game.exe"?
 glacia: generally, when you run wine, it prints stuff to stdout
 glacia: and I'm asking when your application fails, what does wine say? Usually it will tell you more or less exactly what the problem is
 red2kic: brilliantly
 red2kic: there's still some other su configuration that incorrect
 red2kic: it asks for the user's password, not the root password
 red2kic: I don't think that has anything to do with /etc/group
 ajdonnison: then what does?
 ajdonnison: that was my main concern to begin with, actually, not so much that the user was in sudoers
 ajdonnison: yes
 ajdonnison: sudo asks for the user password; not the root password (not the same thing as su)
 alphamale: not neccesarily
 ajdonnison: both
 ajdonnison: the problem is that (even though the user isn't in sudoers right now), that sudo asks for his password
 and no the root password like I'd expect
 soreau: how is that not a straightforward question?
 red2kic: that wasn't neccessarily the problem: it was me borking the package manager
 red2kic: which was 100% my fault
 red2kic: among many other things, yes
 red2kic: another problem was moving from openoffice to libreoffice
 red2kic: that caused more problems than you'd expect
 red2kic: for whatever reason, openoffice could not be uninstalled while gnome was installed
 red2kic: (I think it was a specific component.. email or something...)
 red2kic: it wasn't "gnome" it was specific components; I'm aware of this :)
 red2kic: as I recall, it was like gnome-workspace among others
 how does wubi work, anyway?
 is it just an embedded version of qemu?
 red2kic: that's *what* it does, not *how* it does it :)
 FHtrain: why?
 FHtrain: isn't it just being virtualized?
 FHtrain: I don't see how that would cause problems with the package management
 red2kic: and somehow it's a windows "application"?
 red2kic: that doesn't make sense; and it you can't flexibly install packages or do a distribution upgrade?
 red2kic: how?
 tripelb: transcode works pretty well
 tripelb: hwinfo?
 tripelb: for other's "uptime" :P
 tripelb: I was being facetious with "uptime" :P
 tripelb: how about hwinfo --short?
 tripelb: what are you looking for in particular?
 faryshta: that would work
 faryshta: wget works
 tripelb: oh, well it doesn't need to be that specific; he's probably just interested if you're running some insane core i7 @ 10ghz or something rediculously stupid like that
 faryshta: that's what you're supposed to do with wget, by the way :P
 faryshta: who downloaded it to begin with?
 red2kic: it might not work... for example, you can't resume a partially downloaded torrent :P (or anything else "mulithreaded" for that matter)
 faryshta: the server might just plain not allow resuming
 tripelb: that gets somewhat boring somewhere around line 26 :)
 what would be cool is if ubottu actually *was* intelligent
 if he actually learned from everything everyone said in the channel...
 like running that ken-jennings-beating-jeopardy-bot
 Guest66097: perhaps you should adjust your snr
