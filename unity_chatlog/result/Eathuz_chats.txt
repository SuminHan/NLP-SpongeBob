 Hey!
 I got a question: I loaded Ubuntu 11 on a USB. It works fine when booting from it on my MacBook Pro, but I for some reason get "Boot Error" everytime I boot it on my ASUS P5N-D. Any ideas or suggestions? I've googled it and I can't seem to find a solution.
 I don't want to repeat my question, since it seems rude, but I'm kinda stuck and would really like some help :)

 Sylphid, tried downloading it and building the USB both from Mac and Windows.
 Sylphid, it's the basic: "Boot Error" - "DISK BOOT FAILURE INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER"
 Sylphid, thanks for trying to help. I gave up and spent 10 minutes trying to find an empty CD. Found one and it's booting fine. I guess USB booting is simply out of the question
 Sylphid, tried both, no improvement. But it doesn't matter anyway. Thanks for taking your time :)
 Sylphid, I agree. I'll try that later on. It's rather late here, so didn't think that far :)

 I want to install Ubuntu on a partition of a harddrive I already "prepared" or rather made it already. Where should I install the bootloader? Should this be on the W7 partition?
 When installing Ubuntu, which partition type should I use? And since I'm dual booting it with W7, should I install the boot loader on the same drive as the W7 boot loader?
