 ActionParsnip: does it make any sense? I know its a while ago you started helping with the fullscreen flash video computer crashes, but you disconnected after you asked me for the output :)
 hmm..
 anyone else that can help with flash video making my ubuntu crash in full screen? (ubuntu 11.04 64bit, nvidia adapter)
 Xylch: probably default 32bit
 Xylch: thanks, I will download it and try.. do I need to remove the 32bit?
 Xylch: ok, then I just need to google how to use the .so file and im set to go :)
 Xylch: any idea what folder its supposed to be in?
 Xylch: I did a locate :)
