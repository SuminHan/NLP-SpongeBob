 hey, I'm trying to set my screen refresh rate to 75Hz on Lucid 10.04
 there is no xorg.conf as I found out so I created one with
 Xorg -configure
 it did create it with SubSection "Display" Modes "1920x1080_75"
 it put the .xorg.conf into my home folder, so I copied it as xorg.conf to /etx/X11
 but it doesn't work still, the only options in Monitors=>Refresh rate is 60Hz
