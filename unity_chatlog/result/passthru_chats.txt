 a111, did you have really formated the partition or just made a "ntfs partition" entry on cfdisk ?
 odd.
 a111, did you saw what fdisk -l returns ?
 a111, see if it really returns that partition as properly an NTFS-formated
 Calinou, theorically you can stop the download with CTRL+C and continue after
 Calinou, giving the same location to WGET with -c option
 :)

 np Calinou, we all are :)
 xskydevilx, atm i'm using brtfs (experimental) w/o problems :)
 J697, using Unity (new interface) or classic ?
 J697, odd. i have a legacy PC and using Unity-2D w/o problems
 J697, for me it is quite faster than the past version
 J697, i heard about some persons get problem while using acceleration driver on X with Unity

 J697, maybe
 J697, try disabling 3D acceleration and switching to classic mode to see it continues
 i didn't have problems since i'm using a non-accelerated video card
 and using Unity 2D
 the only problem I had with this version was a annoying crash on unity :)
 hum

 Boa noite
