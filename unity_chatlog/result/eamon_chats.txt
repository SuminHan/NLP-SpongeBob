 div-0: you'll want to add whatever that guide is telling you to add to that file
 rgr: why is it silly to recommend to make an xorg.conf file?
 kjxl9: the drivers are in the kernel
 rgr: why do you say that making an xorg.conf file is silly?
 div-0: are you still having trouble with the nvidia drivers?
 div-0: have you tried following this guide? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto If so, what step are you stuck on?
 div-0: I can link you to an advaced guide that will allow you to hi-jack the system from a live cd and edit the root filesystem from the livecd as though it were the native root filesystem of the environment
 div-0: This is kihd of advanced, do you want that guide?
 div-0: This is a gentoo guide. Use your liveCD and open a terminal, then mount your root filesystem that you want to install drivers on to "/mnt/gentoo" (the name does not matter, its whats used in the guide) the follow the steps at "entering the new environment" on http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?part=1&chap=6 then start installing the nvidia packages according to this
 guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
