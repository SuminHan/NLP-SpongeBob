 hi
 having trouble with apt-get can anyone help?
 which channel is for apt-get?
 when trying to install some packages, i get "Hash Sum mismatch" after download, have tried google, have tried other mirrors, apt-get update several times, have tried in xubunu and ubunu 11.04 this did not happen in 10.10
 no sudo apt-get update does not help
 i am on 11.04
 Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/t/texlive-base/texlive-latex-base-doc_2009-11_all.deb  Hash Sum mismatch
 E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?
 apt-get -f install does not fix it, downloads again and gives the same error
 usr13: i am trying your solution now (slow internet here)
 usr13, with rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/* i get the same error again
 it's like 100KB/s
 this is strange, have been trying for 3 days, i am not new to ubuntu have been a debian/ubuntu user for ages now
 apt-get install texlive-latex-base
 Reading package lists... Done

 The following extra packages will be installed:

 please see http://paste.ubuntu.com/603415/
 usr13, do you get anything from http://paste.ubuntu.com/603415/ ?
 iggyology: top-right corner
 i can download the packages (have done that before) but when i say dpkg -i package i get an error
 please have a look http://paste.ubuntu.com/603424/
 yes i have done that, does not help
 igi69: same thing happens when i use other mirrors
 i have tried the main server as well as some european ones
 you mean synaptic?
 i'll try that now
 where is add/remove? i have synaptic and software center
 ubuntu sofware center says: failed to download package files and under that Failed to fetch http://ubuntu.qualitynet.net/ubuntu/pool/main/p/perl/perl-modules_5.10.1-17ubuntu4.1_all.deb Hash Sum mismatch
 usr13: the thread just suggests changing the mirror, but i have done that before and doesn't work
