 upgrade to 11.04, when I open Firefox I can't seem to access any of the Unity stuff (no global menu, BFB, launcher items... have to switch workspaces to see any of that. and super doesn't bring up the dashboard...). Thoughts?
 spikebike: and that will fix my current user's settings? I can see Unity stuff, until I open Firefox or focus on Firefox...
 spikebike: ah, nm; restarting Firefox did the trick...
