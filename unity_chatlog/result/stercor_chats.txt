 Where would I go to post a question about firewalls and routers?
 Where are the firewall settings in Ubuntu 10.04LTS?
 I'm trying what's been suggested.
 I installed gufw and ALLOW port 22 IN from Anywhere.  I opened up the router for port 22.  When I ssh localhost the message is: ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused.
 celthunder: where?
 celthunder: Ah. OK.
 celthunder: I added ssh: ALL: ALL and sshd: ALL: ALL No change. still refuses the connection.
 ZykoticK9: Another thing to look at :-)
 brous-kee: That's over my head.
 celthunder: /usr/bin/ssh-agent /usr/bin/dbus-launch --exit-with-session gnome-session
