 sudokode, screen lets you run multiple shells and disconnect... but not also edit files, get on irc, read info pages, and be able to copy/paste between them
 sudokode, they don't share a common kill ring to copy/paste between, and you can't see what channels people have spoken to you in while you are looking at your info page or vim
 sudokode, if I'm editing a file in the top half of the screen while browsing the info page in the bottom half, I still see the channel name pop up in the info bar if someone speaks to me on irc
 sudokode, then there's the common kill ring, which is quite handy for copying and pasting back and forth.. also iirc, screen doesn't give you scrollback buffers
