 how do you add more workspaces in unity?
 lugkhast: so it is that complicated.... Unity is going to take some getting used to.. heh. Thanks.
 lugkhast: I tried switching to classic and changing the number of workspaces and then logging back into unity, but the change didn't carry over. Was trying to keep from installing compiz, but I guess I have to =/
 anyone using XChat 2.8.8 on 11.04?
 Monotoko: yea
 Monotoko: every nickname I put in the Nicknames not to highlight box gets eaten.
 jo-erlend: ^^
 like I see no reply from them at all...
 but it is in my raw log
 Why is OSS4 not supported? It worked fine in 10.10, at least for me...
 ohsix: It isn't crap. Deadbeef + OSS4 + Foobar2000's home theater eq setting makes my sound system sound way better than Alsa does.
 ohsix: I've used Alsa with the same sound system for ~1.5 years. After I went through the process of switching to OSS4, I did notice a great improvement. Just because OSS3 was crap doesn't mean all of it is crap... "One person's garbage is another person's treasure."
 ohsix: I'm just wondering why the warning was placed on the Wiki. Used to be that you could use any setup you want with it. I didn't expect being flamed for liking it.
 ok, twice now I have gotten a black box of death.....
 this little thing appears on one of my screens, I hover over it to find it is actually a program all smashed up, so I enlarge it and it is just nothing but black... sort of like a dead terminal screen. I exit the thing and unity dies.
