 	hey, I don't know what happened, but my win7 partition won't boot, but when I updated grub's conf file, it still didn't work.
 it throws  some lines of error messages, then says there is no partition
 but I can see it and access it
 and I didn't play with partitions at all

 I don't know
 it just didn't do it
 last time I tried 7 last week, it worked without a hitch
 yeah, that's what it looks like to me at my end...alas

 says it can't find a symbol, then partion, then disk doesn't exist
 I'm sorry, but podcasts of a crazy guy I'm researching work only in windows
 .mp3's don't work, and I can't even get to the damned things!
 still can't get to them--itunes
 yeah..been there...it's a bitch!
 they do, but it's non-standard and touched up for ie8
 Yeah!  The guy's really messed up with EVERYTHING
 he lives in one of the safest cities in the WORLD and has body guards go with him everywhere
 not kidding
 going to try to push him off the deep end

 well, any idea how to get it to work-win7 or hacks?  Need research material
 you can't directly access those servers...which is ass backwards
 tried it
 bison: try running update-grub
 bison: also, make sure you have grub 2
 bison: should take care of it if you regularly update your system
 bison: research super gurb disk--burn it and you'll be set until grub 3 comes out
 captainkrtek, websiteguy, were you two helping me?  I got lost.
 crazy guy research, need windows or a hack
 Need to get win7 to boot!  Symbols missing, partitian "doesn't exist", disk "doesn't exist".  After "update-grub" still didn't work
