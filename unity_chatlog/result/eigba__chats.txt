 incorrect1,  Do you like unity at all? Im not sure if i do or not
 Unity looks ok I guess, just not sure if I like it
 iszak, I asked the same thing. I had to use the damn search feature
 (
 Ive already farted out 2 butt turds trying to figure out if i like unity or not
 ilon, what I did was use the search feature to find settings then pulled it over to the lauchbar. probally not the most productive way though
 Sonja, Agreed
 I wish they would of went with gnome 3.
 well there are several desktop managers most or very old, maybe this unity can progress?

 Fluxbox might look bare at the beggining but it can be configured trough config files to be a really nice desktop enviroment
 Brb, I just farted out a butt turd
 I hope the complaints continue flowing into the Ubuntu team, unity is fine but they should officially support gnome 3 also. I know it can be compiled and installed regardless but they should offically support it
 spungo, Yes same here, I think unity os cool for new users but not for long time linux users

 dncrash, I did the same thing, what i did was delete the config files from my home direcotry to fix it
 dncrash, I deleted the .gnome2, gconf, and gconfd file lol it fixed it for me
 Why are the complaints about unity? You can revert back to Gnome to by choosing Ubuntu classic from gdm login manager correct?
 mrdeb: I like unity, however many are complaining about it, but choosing ubuntu classic from gdm login manager loads gnome 2 correct?
 Stafngrimr: You know its growing on me alot actually, Its nice to have a new Desktop enviroment to play with
 Well you can play with your video driver settings an rotate screen, but then you will have to browse and such with everything else sideways :) hahaha
 All joking aside I wish you could move the bar
 Brb I just farted out a butt turd
