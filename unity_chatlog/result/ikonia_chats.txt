 ShiverOnBT4: are you using backtrack ?
 kk9822: different processor capabailities
 Guest68448: it's called "Windows"
 kk9822: 32bit seems the sensible option unless you have 4GB of ram or more
 Crazy1: :q!
 Guest68448: in this one, it's called "windows"
 warp_: depends on what stage it crashes, just re-do the upgrade process
 Guest68448: showing some respect by using the proper product name, and communitcating cleary,
 Guest68448: you've just said random words, you know the product is called "Windows" - call it "windows" please rather than trying to make excuses, then someone may actually help you
 ricardo: if you ask a question
 ricardo: depends on your hardware, and what you're doing - rule of thumb is same as windows
 Guest68448: you KNOW the product is called windows, so don't use that as an excuse, if you use the correct term "windows" and clearly state your problem, maybe someone will help you
 MattAAron: depends on the xorg dirvers you're using, what video card is it ?
 Dr_Willis: no they can't
 it doesn't support multiple cards
 Dr_Willis: twinview only supports 1 card with multiple ports
 Guest68448: I can, it's called "windows"
 Dr_Willis: 3d acceleration ?
 Dr_Willis: eg: 3 monitors being spanned on two cards with 3d acceleration ?
 mrchak: just ask, people will help if they can
 Dr_Willis: let me double check this as I've actually spoke to people at nvidia about this hence my surprise
 Dr_Willis: still worth me checking up, thanks
 Guest27069: how many disks are in the volume group ?
 Guest27069: pastebin the output of these two commands please "mount" and then the output of "sudo vgdisplay"
 Guest27069: please use a pastebin for the output
 thiebaude: makes no difference
 Guest27069: what is starred out ?
 Guest27069: there is no service risk and for things like device mapper, it makes it hard to see what's going on
 Guest27069: how big is your hard disk ?
 Guest27069: nah, I figured it out enough, just want to check some stuff
 noonoooo: yes
 oops
 muneeb: not for flash no, but for other 32bit stuff, sure
 Sledge: thanks for that random noise
 muneeb: remove it if you want to
 p_ahuja: whats the isse
 issue
 p_ahuja: no, just explain the problem
 p_ahuja: no
 p_ahuja: sorry, not you
 p_ahuja: what are you trying to install
 pattysmatty: when a new ubuntu package is released (updated) you will be offered it
 p_ahuja: ok - so what else isn't installing as you said you can't install "any .sh" files, and your describing one .sh file
 cfc_{Pawpad}: sudo apt-get update brings your list up to date, sudo apt-get upgrade updates the packages
 p_ahuja: may have to contact the .sh file owner/support then if it's just that one
 p_ahuja: you're not using 10.10 though, so that's not relevant
 notb: I don't believe so
 notb: try to encode something ? check the libraries
 p_ahuja: no it doesn't, it means that file works with ubuntu 10.10 - that you're not using, so it's not relevant
 Guest91212: you can stop using phrases like "wtf" please
 p_ahuja: no
 p_ahuja: no
 ic4l: that's personal choice, what's the best dinner to eat ? get it ?
 Josesordo: same as every other distro, it's just an executable, run it
 rgr: enough now - please stop it
 ohsix: let it go please
 Josesordo: run it from a terminal
 guys - enough now, please.
 Josesordo: ./filename.run
 Josesordo: what are you trying to install ?
 Josesordo: why are you trying to install ati drivers ? there are supported ones in the "hardware drivers" tool
 reprapperMC: here is fine
 Josesordo: it will install the ubuntu recommended/supported ones
 Josesordo: depends if it's for that version, however you should look in the repos for packages rather than installing external pacakges
 ^Mike: the PPA's are unsupport, ask the maintainer
 sdegutis: can you stop with the "/me" attempts please - just talk
 adzy: no, grub is on the mbr
 luigi_panache: just ask
 adzy: no problem "master boot record" small chunk of disk that your machine boots from
 adzy: if you install 11.04 grub will get re-applied to the mbr, so "yes" in a basic answer to your question
 Ultimate_Chaos: don't need all user messages, if you have a question, ask
 luigi_panache: best to just ask the channel
 tommylommykins: unity on ubuntu is supported here
 constl: you never "need" swap unless you actually "need" it, it really depends on what you're doing, it's sensible to use it unless you known not to
 _Platypus_: run it with sudo
 _Platypus_: how are you trying to run it exactly ?
 brandonc503: chroot option
 _Platypus_: how are you launching the gui
 _Platypus_: try launching the gui with "gksudo"
 _Platypus_: just a test
 terry: stop with the noise please, ask a question and wait for a response, "anyone" doesn't help, and flooding with "...." doesn't
 terry: 8.04 is lts
 steverm: no, it's release stable
 brandonc503: yes, so use chroot options as I've told you
 djcoin: /dev/sdb is a disk, not a partition, you mount a partition, not a desk
 disk
 djcoin: then there is no partition on that disk
 djcoin: you need to partition the disk
 djcoin: you are mistaken, "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb"
 djcoin: there are no partitions on that disk then
 omidp: they are identical
 djcoin: there is no partition on the disk - data is already gone
 djcoin: it's not mistaken
 djcoin: pastebin the output of "sudo fdisk -l" please
 djcoin: are you running from a livecd ?
 djcoin: you used the command "sudo fdisk -l" yes? exactly like that ?
 djcoin: how did you become root ?
 djcoin: don't use "sudo su"
 djcoin: sudo -i
 djcoin: sudo fdisk -l output please.
 djcoin: I didn't ask for the syslog
 djcoin: look at what it's doing port 5 on the hub is disabling/up/down
 nukem: if you don't know these things - you should be using sudo
 there is no reason to login as root
 nukem: yet you don't know that you need to set a password to login as root
 nukem: the sudo model is quite basic and effective
 bigMike: saying anyone is pointless, ask a question and wait for a response
 nukem: yet you don't understand it.....hence you'd know to set a root password
 nukem: there isn't one
 nukem: they all use the sudo security model
 hello
 nukem: don't use ubuntu then, thanks
 bigMike: what's the problem ?
 pao: ask in #backtrack-linux - we don't support backtrack in this channel
 bigMike: at boot time ?
 bigMike: 11.04 ?
 Herbs: what ?
 Herbs: what are you talking about ?
 Belias:  text editor and a compiler - gcc is the most common on the linux platform
 bigMike: has this ever worked ?
 Herbs: no-one said it's not, what are you talking about
 bigMike: can you boot the box ?
 bigMike: virtual container ? in that case look at the permissions
 pao: join the mailing list then
 bigMike: within the container
 pao: read the support information on their website
 bigMike: of the ttyp1 device file, but the one that is within the container
 bigMike: can you show me the output of uname -a please ?
 Herbs: control the language please.
 Herbs: you've said that - give it a rest
 pao: look on their website
 bigMike: it maybe worth talking to your hosting provider, the reason I say that is that vps has a modified kernel (other things are probably modified too)
 syn3rgy: not interested in your porn issues, drop it now
 syn3rgy: we can help you with technical issues - just don't be provokative with the topic as you are clearly trying to be
 DonDraper: nothing - it won't have done anything
 NickUK`: no
 Glycan: ##windows
 NickUK`: no it doesn't there is a layer of protection within coreutils
 coz_: stop it
 coz_: "stop it"
 DonDraper: stop putting that command in the channel
 Incarus6: exactly
 NickUK`: done what ?
 what command ?
 I didn't tell you to do anything ?
 scott__: it may be talking about a different package, not the one you are trying to install
 syn3rgy: are you struggling to grasp this channels topic ?
 syn3rgy: stop - check the topic, it's ubuntu support discussion
 syn3rgy: how is that an ubuntu support comment ?
 gordon_: join the lfs support channel
 syn3rgy: then it's nothing to do with ubuntu - get with the topic "ubuntu support" please
 so ?
 syn3rgy: so that has nothing to do with the discussion - this is the last time I'll tell you, #ubuntu is for ubuntu support discussion, please try to get with it
 ubuntu-user: no, you don't "need" to
 jooiiee: what did you install ?
 bullethead: it's not supported here
 jooiiee: have you kept it up to date ?
 jooiiee: then you are running the stable version
 pao: you've been told 3 times - #backtrack-linux is the correct channel
 preyas: many people, ask a question
 preyas: no idea
 oops
 preyas: escape chats a\ b.gif
 pylix escape chars  a\ b.gif
 15:30 < ikonia> oops
 preyas: wrong person, sorry
 Dedego: install the build-essential package
 escott: build-essential will install gcc
 hnsz: it's just a text file
 hnsz: such as ?
 hnsz: record usage ?
 recourse ?
 hnsz: can you pastebin me what you see in your motd when you login ?
 hnsz: pastebin it, lets see as most of that is controlled from parameter variables within the motd
 !pastebinit
 hnsz: it's not writing a script - just install the tool "pastebinit"
 Ultimate_Chaos: it's fully available from the gnome repos
 service ssh stop
 salomonv: pidgin isn't in ubuntu any more
 salomonv: how are you using it, if it's not in ubuntu any more
 salomonv: how are you using using it, if it's not in ubuntu any more
 salomonv: where did you install it from ?
 !info pidgin
 wow, it's still in main
 salomonv: so it doesn't go to the tray when you minimise it
 bsodmike: look at the file /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock is it there
 bsodmike: ok - so either a problem or mysql server is not running
 bsodmike: check it's running ?
 bsodmike: ok, so you're going to have to check some logs first, the syslog and the mysql log is a good place to start
 bsodmike: ok - painful, but here we go, walk through the init script to the part where ir runs mysqld-safe and try running that line
 bsodmike: you'll find it's a link to the upsetart script
 upstart even
 bsodmike: give a minute, eating
 bsodmike: look for pid file
 bsodmike: be with you asap
 bsodmike: ok - lets work this through
 bsodmike: can you pastebin the output of "ps -ef | grep mysql" please
 bsodmike: can you pastebin the init script for me please so we can work it through (not got an ubuntu box to hand to do it)
 bsodmike: you may want to use pastebinit to make it easy
 !pastebinit | bsodmike
 dusf: that would not be legal so please don't ask
 dusf: that doesn't matter, it's illegal
 dusf: yes
 bsodmike: tell you what, can you run "sudo mysqld-safe" please ?
 killaz__: do not tell someone to break a license agreement
 killaz__: enough -
 killaz__: I'll say this one time - do not recommend someone break the license
 bsodmike: that's fine, I'm not seeing a change when I refresh, are you sure the pastebin address is right
 bsodmike: sorry, it did change
 got it
 bsodmike: ok - ps -ef | grep mysql anything running ?
 bsodmike: ok anything in the syslog ?
 ahhhhhhh I think I know the problem
 bsodmike: what version of ubuntu is this ?
 ahhh a vps
 bsodmike: please do "dpkg -l | grep -i mysql"
 bsodmike: I think we are getting there.......
 bsodmike: sudo find / -name mysqld -print
 bsodmike: that's surprised me
 bsodmike: didn't expect it to be there
 bsodmike: ok, lets up the aunty a bit
 bsodmike: /usr/sbin/mysqld
 bsodmike: let me walk this through in my head
 bsodmike: can you do "which mysqld" please
 bsodmike: /usr/sbin/mysqld --verbose
 bsodmike: ok - I can't be %100 sure without more effort, but what I'm guessing is one of the libraries/deps mysql wants to use is missing
 bsodmike: if it was there, and there was a problem that command would give you output
 bsodmike: maybe worth "sudo apt-get reinstall mysql-server"
 bsodmike: see if it pulls down any of the debs
  bsodmike no, that's data files, they are safe
 bsodmike: back them up if you are unsure
 bsodmike: hang on, I'm rusty
 bsodmike: it's apt-get install --reinstall mysql-server
 bsodmike: the data files are normally /var/lib/mysql
 bsodmike: looks like it, I think -A is all
 however.....
 bsodmike: sudo find / -name '*.MYD' -print will show you the db files
 bsodmike: you can manually back them up if you want
 bsodmike: whoaa, easy on the language
 bsodmike: you're dependency tree is messed up by the looks of it
 I'm guessing due to the restore
 xeodox: yes it can be what you want, it's just a hostname
 Doom_-_: ##windows
 bsodmike: trying to think of the best way to deal with it
 Doom_-_: #ubuntu will bug you if you're trying to do something illegal
 bsodmike: I'm trying to think of a way to regenerate the package list so it knows what's installed, I have done this before years ago, so I'm confident it's doable
 bsodmike: I'm cautious of stackoverflow guides
 bsodmike: I don't think it's a bug, I think it's due to your restore messing it up
 bsodmike: I'm thinking clear the cache file down and the bin file - re-run sudo apt-get update to get the current list, then install the missing packages then mysql-server package
 even if it thinks somethings there - reinstall it so the dependency tree is up to date
 bsodmike: there is a better way to do this, but I can't remember it
 bsodmike: it's awkward not having a box to work it through with you, so I'm running from memory
 bsodmike: can you pastebin ls -la /var/apt/cache please
 psalden: if you card works with fglrx it will
 bsodmike: sure
 !info libc6 lucid
 !info libacl1 lucid
 mastaofdisasta: it's a problem with your network config, not upstart
 mastaofdisasta: you shouldn't need to use /etc/network/interfaces, use the network admin tool from the gui
 mastaofdisasta: 1.) don't use the phrase gay 2.) you clearly can't configure network interfaces file so you should use the gui
 JoshDreamland: if that's all you've got to say, please don't speak, this is for support discussion
 JoshDreamland: he's already been told - drop it
 JoshDreamland: sorry, not you
 LjL: 12 per arch I believe
 excluding backports
 LjL: a whole release is about 60GB
 all archs/updates/repos/
 I'll check now
 AFD: look at the errors, it's complaining about your external repos
 AFD: you've got a ton of external repos in there that are nothing to do with official ubuntu repos
 AFD: then your interenet connection / dns is not working
 lemorek: that's your problem then
 lemorek: that's not how you upgrade
 abhinav_singh: it's fine
 no
 lets just move along please.

 R3dy: how are you adding it ?
