 Arachon: yes. sometimes they also have cached data and similar things put there by the program
 Arachon: it depends on the game. Some games use /var/games
 needlez: screensaver crashed for me earlier today, after upgading. I disabled it
 Josesordo: they both seemed odd to me, so I switched to xfce
 Josesordo: I think so; http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=203877
 Name141: I had all sorts of trouble with the 64bit iso today
 Name141: does it have any sort of error message?
 Name141: sure; but what sort of error do you get, if any?
 Lxndr: I used to be able to do with with rhythmbox, but for some reason I can't seem to do it with banshee now.
 do you get a mouse pointer? Is the machine set to boot from the cd drive?
 Josesordo: whatever you prefer, it's up to you.
 needlez: the drivers are usually done automatically, if you selected the box for non-free software at the beginning of the install
 Name141: try the 32bit, see if it works better. I had to burn three discs before I managed to get one that worked today
 Name141: what time is it for you locally?
 shiftingcontrol: usually you can just reboot and start again
 Name141: that sucks
 shiftingcontrol: how are you doing the update the first time?
 shiftingcontrol: sometimes you have to run dpkg --configure --pending or similar. but I would start by just trying the update again, assuming the system will boot
 if it won't boot, I would do what I would recommend in the first place: don'ty upgrade, just install clean
 jerriy: what is the problem?
 newbie112: it works in other applications?
 try making a new profile in terminal to see if it's something in the profile preferences
 file->new profile
 jerriy: what command are you typing that it says that?
 jerriy: please run this: sudo whoami
 does it say "root" ?
 jerriy: when you run 'sudo whoami' it says something about resolving the host?
 this is before it asks for a password?
 jerriy: can you run 'gksudo gnome-terminal' successfully?
 jerriy: can you post the exact error, and the contents of /etc/hosts, to a pastebin?
 jerriy: what output do you get from 'hostname'
 jerriy: ok, making progress. now, run '/sbin/ifconfig lo' and tell me if you see "inet addr:127.0.0.1"
 GamingDroid: no, 11.04 is not LTS
 jerriy: the problem seems to be you have 127.0.1.1 in /etc/hosts but you need to have 127.0.0.1
 Otoris: stand farther away from the screen?
 Otoris:  I don't like it either, but I couldn't see any direct way to configure the size or the color
 maybe someone else here knows
 jerriy: or just change the 127.0.1.1 to 127.0.0.1
 I can't guarantee that's the problem, but it seems like something that's not right
 Otoris: if you install the compiz settings manager, it's under 'Unity plugin' -> 'Experimental'
 the package name is compizconfig-settings-manager and the program name is than ccsm
 honsson: not much, really
 kippers: there are a lot of people here; just ask your question and someone will respond
 jerriy: but still the same error, error resolving host myhost
 jerriy: is that right - that you still have the error?
 after that change, I'm not sure what's up
 you haven't edited /etc/sudoers or anything like that, right?
 jerriy: but does it pop up a terminal?
 I mean, does it run gnome-terminal, or prompt for a password, or just do nothing?
 and 'sudo whoami' still says it can't resolve the host?
 jerriy: on my system, if I remove the line from /etc/hosts, I get the error message, but it also runs the command for me
 jerriy: like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601545/
 what do you mean waiting?
 jerriy: that sounds like you are typing the wrong password?
 do you have auto login, or do you type the password to log in?
 by the way, it seems that both 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.1.1 work for me, so that was not the problem
 so you run su, and it gives that error, then you type the password, and it says 'Sorry, try again', and you try again. if you do it trhee times, what does it say?
 ABCZY: don't we all
 jerriy: try typing your password at the prompt just to make sure it appears correctly
 jerriy: try 'su jerriy' ( or whtevery your username is) and see if that will accept your password
 jerriy: that is very odd; you should be able to su to yourself
 you actually type your password to log into the computer, it does not log you in automatically - is that right?
 jerriy: for some reason it does not seem to be accepting your password. I have no idea why. you could try resetting it (in recovery mode) and then try sudo again
 KNUBBIG: it runs mine
 try putting 'echo bashrc' at the top and ssh again
 KNUBBIG: are you running a shell over ssh, or running some other program?
 KNUBBIG: I mean are you running some other program over ssh
 rather than just 'ssh hostname'
 jerriy: I'm sorry, but I don't know
 from the command line you use the command 'passwd'
 but it will ask for your old passwd first
 sakuramboo: he already can't run sudo
 jerriy: you are typing your password, not the root password, right?
 shcherbak: he can't even su to himself, so the problem is deeper than that
 jerriy: just one more time, try: su USERNAME -c whoami
 replacing USERNAME with your username
 it will ask for a password
 if it works, you will see it print your username again
 jerriy: yes, you should get permission denied for that
 jerriy: but for the 'su' one, it should work. that is not going through sudo. something is wrong with your password, or something is wrog with your authentication setup
 I am surprised you can log in
 linuasus6: did you update to 11.04 when this happened?
 Just installed 11.04, running xfce. When I go to the printer configuration, it asks me for the root password :)  Does anyone know what command that is so I can run it in sudo?
 ActionParsnip: I am going to install a network printer; I'm not sure what you mean by the install program
 ActionParsnip: I am not running an installer, I am running the 'Printing' item on the settings menu
 my question was what program to run from the command line
 ActionParsnip: yes, but it is asking me for the root password - that's why I put the smiley face on my original question. there is no root password, but the default install is asking for it, so I am trying to work around it
 ActionParsnip: thanks, 'alacarte' was what I was missing
