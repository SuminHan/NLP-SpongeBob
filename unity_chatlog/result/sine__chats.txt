 hi guys. i just installed ubuntu but it said i do not have the hardware to run unity. i have just bought a new asus with i7 8GB RAM and nvidia geforce gtx 460M
 hello guys. when i started ubuntu it says i do not have the hardware to run unity. what is unity and what is it about my geforce gtx 460m with i7 and 8gb of ram that wont run it
 ubottu: thanks, i will start now, i think its because i did not choose to install third party and thus nvidia drivers so it would not work
 fingers crossed
 Buddhacz: i have them installed now. i have rebooted but i cant see any difference i will check out the website to see how this baby rides
