 hello!  I made an ubuntu minimal install, but I can't seem to get the wireless working.  i've installed wireless-tools, but iwlist scan returns the following error:   "wlan0     interface doesn't support scanning:  network is down".  I initially followed the instructions here:  http://www.mini-itx.com/projects/xbmc-ion/module/8
 I should mention that the computer in question is presently connected to an ethernet cable and I'm working via ssh

 sudo iwlist scan outputs my access point's ESSID (among others), but when I type "sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid <my router's ESSID>" I get the following error:  essid:  unknown host
 what gives?
 I'm trying to connect to a WPA/WPA2 network from the command line.  I have wpa_supplicant installed.  I can get wlan0 up and "sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid myssid" succeeds silently.  However, when I type "sudo iwconfig wlan0 key <HEXKEY>" I get the following error:  "error for wireless request "Set  Encode" (8ZB2A) : SET failed on device wlan0; Invalid argument.
 any ideas ?
 celthunder:  it's an "L" not an "i" =)  Just so i see the red text pop up next time.  Regarding your question, I'm not sure.  It didn't work for a regular text key
 GreeNtooTH:  I used the output of wpa_passphrase... the second psk line
 GreeNtooTH:  was that not the right thing to use?
 anybody k now what this iwconfig error means:  Error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2A) :
     invalid argument "newfagscanttriforce".
    It occurs when I try to "sudo iwconfig wlan0 key <mykeyhere>"
 GreeNtooTH, yes
 GreeNtooTH:  wpa_supplicant is installed as well
 GreeNtooTH:  ndiswrapper is for using windows drivers, isn't it?
 GreeNtooTH:  i'm not sure what you mean by "go to wpa supplicant 1st 1 down then enter phrase"
 GreeNtooTH:  iwconfig:  unkonwn command "passphrase"
 !patience|beta__
 GreeNtooTH:  this is my wpa_supplicant.conf:  network={        ssid="loldongs"        #psk="newfagscanttriforce"        psk=c9359d509dd9f61e7bc3991ff258e1f89fba92723be387f613fd6f5d1756a166}   what needs to be changed?
 GreeNtooTH:  so these commands should all work, right:  sudo ifconfig wlan0 up, sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid <YOUR WIRELESS ROUTER's ESSID>, sudo iwconfig wlan0 key <YOUR KEY>, sudo dhclient wlan0
 GreeNtooTH:  and just to make sure i'm not doing anything wrong, what exactly needs to go in the <YOUR KEY> section of "sudo iwconfig wlan0 key <YOUR KEY>" ?
 a hex key?  passphrase?
 GreeNtooTH:  because I'm still getting Error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2A):  SET failed on device wlan0 ; Invalid argument.
 GreeNtooTH:  ok trying that...
 GreeNtooTH:  SET failed on device wlan0; operation not permitted
 GreeNtooTH:  that's a command?
 GreeNtooTH:  wlan0     no private ioctls
 GreeNtooTH:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/602488/
 GreeNtooTH:  i see no mention of wlan0 in that file...
 GreeNtooTH:  the entire file should be replaced with "auto wlan0" ?
 GreeNtooTH:  could you pastebin it please?  I'm afraid i"ll miss a line
 GreeNtooTH:  sorry?
 GreeNtooTH:  oh I understand.  go to paste.ubunto.com and type out what you want me to replace my file with.  Then press "paste" and give me the link
 GreeNtooTH:  and thanks for your help, btw!
 GreeNtooTH:  how's it working out?
 GreeNtooTH:  is this what you wanted me to change my /etc/network/interfaces to?  http://paste.ubuntu.com/602491/
 GreeNtooTH, ok trying that now.  and then I run the same command?
 GreeNtooTH:  and the 'yourpsk' line... is tthat the hex key or the passphrase?
 GreeNtooTH:  and the 'yourpsk' line... is tthat the hex key or the passphrase?
 GreeNtooTH;  ok better change that
 GreeNtooTH:  ok now i'm getting DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval <x>
 GreeNtooTH:  i did that
 GreeNtooTH:  I get the following output from the restart command:  wlan0 no private ioctls   failed to bring up wlan0
 GreeNtooTH:  still the same output
 GreeNtooTH:  not sure.  it works out of the box on the regular ubuntu desktop install.  this is a minimal install
 GreeNtooTH;  how do I do that?
 GreeNtooTH:  this is cli-only... i usually use jockey-gtk
