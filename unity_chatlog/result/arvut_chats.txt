 how big should I make the /etc and /boot partitions on a lucid install? I made a 8.1GB / and got a 57GB /home from previous install of maverick
 less than 1GB?
 !ask iomari
 what is the size of a standard parameter for a ext4 filesystem and is it a good idea to change it? (I'm partitioning a disk for installation atm, using 4.1GB)
 ah, here it is.
 is there a good reason to make the swap bigger than the ram when I have 2gb of ddr2 ram?
 joH28: ty, I probably wont do that. 2gb mem is enough for what I do on the laptop. desktop has 8gb tho, you can probably understand why ;)
 joH28: my win7 worked fine until 2 days ago. all hibernation attempts since then has failed :/ gonna try it on ubuntu and gentoo once I have those installed.
 nemo: sc2?
 doesn't portal 2 make us of dx10 or dx11 then?
