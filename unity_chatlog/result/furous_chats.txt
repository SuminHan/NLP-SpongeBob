 anyone know why unity would work from a live  cd but not when the system is upgraded on the hdd?
 The graphics on the motherboard is Intel GMA X4500
 unity worked perfectly from the live cd, no errors...
 The system on the hdd did not come from the live cd though, it was an upgrade...
 When logging in to the hdd system, it said the system couldn't display unity.  But why would i display via the live cd?
 no extra hard ware drivers listed for this hardware...
 all indcations suggest that it should work and the live cd demonstrates that, perhaps I should do a reinstall instead of the upgrade, perhaps something went wrong during the upgrade
 celthunder:unity worked via a lie cd but when the system was upgraded unity no longer worked...

 telinit 5 does indeed not work...
 So I should reboot to get out then?
 OK, so reboot it is then!
 well I couldn't get out of that init 3 screen...
 it won't even go back to the prompt so that I can write anything!
 rebooted, did ctrl alt f1 again, did touch .Xauthority, and startx gives me"xauth: (stdin):2:unknown command
 bare with me, rebooting again...
 permission is to create and delete files, there is an .Xauthority file there [now?] and it has read and write permission
 so i should focus on Xauthority as being the problem?
 permission is to create and delete files, there is an .Xauthority file there [now?] and it has read and write permissio
 other hidden files in the home directory seem to have read and write permissins too...
 does it matter what permissions the group has if the owner has read and write?
 thanks for your help, I will keep searching to find the answer...
