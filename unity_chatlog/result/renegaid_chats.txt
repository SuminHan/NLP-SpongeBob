 ubuntu seems to get slower and slower with every release
 anyone installed uubuntu in windows
 i always found audio to be really poor in all lunux distros. don't understand why
 5.1 does not work. sound scratchy when adjusting audo
 just not the same
 ubuntu 11.04 does not install broadcom drivers
 is there anything that i can do to make things faster? things load so slow
