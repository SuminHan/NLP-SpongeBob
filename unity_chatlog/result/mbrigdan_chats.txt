 Hey! I just updated to 11.04, and now, if I use "ubuntu" as a session, I don't get any desktop menus (but I do get my desktop icons). If I use "Ubuntu Classic", everything works fine. I'm assuming I'm having a problem with Unity?
 Hello! Since I upgraded to 11.04, all my window decorations in compiz (i don't really like unity) have disappeared. I've tried reinstalling many things, (even new window decorators, such as emerald) but nothing works, and it makes it hard to do things

 xangua, Well, it wasn't working before emerald either, so I thought I might as well try it
 lyle, compiz --replace appears to be stuck on Setting Update "run_command_terminal_key", still no window decorations
 lyle, Still nothing, but the previous compiz --replace (in a terminal) segfaulted and died

 lyle, Hey! Window decorations! That's nice. I do rather like compiz though, do you know how I could get it working again?
 lyle, Hmm, going back gets rid of them again. Maybe I'll reinstall all the compiz packages
 lyle, Do you happen to know there the proprietary drivers setting has gone? I figure I might as well double check, but I can't find it under System->Preferences or Administration
 lyle, hmm, is there a difference between the NVIDIA binary Xorg driver and the NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver?
 lyle, No, but the currently enable one (accelerated graphics) says recommended, so I'll just leave it
 lyle, I upgraded
 lyle, Yay, I fixed it. Apparently the "Window Decorations" compiz plugin has disappeared somehow, and re-installing compiz plugins made it come back, so I just had to enable it. Thanks for the help
