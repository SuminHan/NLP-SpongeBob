 help! how do i move the unity toolbar to the bottom
 how do i move the unity dock?
 taglass, :(
 ohsix, ccsm?
 ohsix, cmd not found :( ... i think i found it installed in software center though?
 ohsix, i am in ccsm, do you recall the setting where it switches it
 ohsix, oh haha, i opened that setting but missed it. thanks :D
 ohsix, its saying the new value for the edge binding for the action reveal mode conflicts with flip down of the desktop wall plugin..  then when i set to bottom it doesnt show up :S
 ohsix, ok thanks for the help any way :)
 where is my show desktop button in unity?
 can someone recommend me a package for unraring rar files
 i look for rar in software center and its not there
 unrar is there but id like to make rar files too
 xsinick, the bugs are the fun part :>
 xsinick, its ok :)
 i think im going to try 7zip
 thanks everyone for the continued help :D
 i right clicked and it let me install rar package, lol that was easy
 yuskhanzab, do you know the address
 yuskhanzab, maybe try getting it from a different mirror
 cdg, you need to customize it. try turning off auto hide on your dock. i seem to like that better
 yuskhanzab, i left mine on while i went to class and it was done when i got back (2 or so hours)
 cdg, install compiz manager
 cdg, in terminal type ccsm and it should tell you how to install
 cdg, i am still trying to get it to dock on the bottom... the setting is there but it fails to show up
 cdg, thanks to ohsix for helping me get this originally :)
 credit where credit is due
 yuskhanzab, i dont think so... are you updating the kernel?
 stbain1, dont kill it yet, mine took a while to update
 stbain1, i was playing call of duty for about 2 maps and it was still updating
 stbain1, search and destroy not tdm
 stbain1, sorry not update, it was fresh install
 yuskhanzab, if you backed up your information im sure its ok to cancel. if not give it a few more minutes
 Robert__, if you were on the new version you would know it :P
 xsinick, yes i am pretty sure. i have the nvidia control panel up and it recognizes my card
 yuskhanzab, sorry im out of answers.. try asking it again and see if you get any nibbles
 xsinick, do you remember the command to check.. you grep some file
 xsinick, the true test will be if my computer games will run like they did in gnome
 xsinick, no but i have one stored somewhere. i was thinking of getting it out but im lazy
 maybe after finals
 i tried adding a .sh script to my unity dock and it wont add. any ideas?
 why cant i add a .sh file to my dock?
 yes
 ubuntuguy, do you think it would work in startup applications?

 top right click the button and the last option
 system settings

 chreestopher, once you get comfortable with ubuntu you should go with more advanced distributions
 you will run into problems which will make you learn more
 always keep ubuntu though haha

 ASDF_, you can try it.
 linusasus6, good night and good luck :)
 newb_, i think you can use gnome2 :P
 ASDF_, how's it going?
 did you try looking for an option in the live cd?
 does it recognize it as 10.10 ?
 how far in the upgrade did you get
 mine took a long time.. but i did a fresh install
 thegoodcushion, i think you can still get a pakage in software center
 newb_, good luck
 ASDF_, yes
 ASDF_, do you have an ipod or something
 ASDF_, not very much space but i think so.. mine is 160 gigs but i use separate data partition
 sebastian, when you log in at the bottom look for classic gnome
