 Hi, just have a quick question if no one minds :) I dual boot Ubuntu 10.4 with Windows XP and from all the updates my grub menu has got quite long now lol
 is there an easy way to clean up my grub menu and remove old kernels I no longer need to save space and shorten the grub list ?
 i already tried that zvacet :s then i ran soemthign like "sudo update-grub2"
 and restarted and nothing changed :(
 should i not use "sudo update-grub2" after removeing old kernels ?
 ok thanks
 ill try it now
 hmm ok
 ill give it another try then
 ok i just removed the older kernels is there a command I can use to view my grub list without having to restart ?
 ok thanks
 it worked thanks guys :)
