 should i upgrade to the new ubuntu?

 hello, i have installed portal 2 on wine and i am getting intense flickering in the video when playing, ive google searched this problem and i am coming up with nothing, i am sure my graphic card drivers are updated
 i have radeon hd4870
 i mean the game
 the sequence movies seem fine its in game
 switching to windowed mode helps but not fully still unplayable, in non-windowed its very insane flickering
 bobbyd: not sure how to do that, ill do some research
