 Anyone available to help me with a problem?
 escott: I wanted to see if someone was available before I explained the whole ordeal.
 I'm attempting to figure out why my internal mic and speakers aren't working.
 dustin_: Inspiron 1546
 a7i3n: Not sure what you mean by that.
 akharris: That sucks. :(
 escott, it's AMD.
 escott, I also tried the alsamixer and it showed internal mic as being 100%.
 dustin_, I've checked alsamixer to make sure it wasn't muted (as I just mentioned to escott). It said it is at 100%.
 It's alright.
 It was working when I did the fresh install for 11.04, because I could see it in the normal sound preferences dialog from the sound menu.
 I mean. It shows that it has an internal mic, so I know it's recognizing it. I just don't get why it's not picking up any sound.
 escott, you have any clue to another solution besides going into the alsamixer direction, since I've already been there?
 Ah, fml.
 Okay, guys..
 I added ~/.pulse/client.conf, and disabled autospawn for Pulseaudio, so ALSA could take over for it.
 ALSA works fine, but it's not showing anything in sound preferences on Ubuntu.
 Anyone have any idea on how to fix that?
 celthunder: I know that.. but is there a way to get it to where Ubuntu will show it in the sound menu again?
 Because I can't use my multimedia keys to turn the volume up & down without it working.
 I just changed it to use ALSA as default.
 But when I go to "sound preferences", it says "Waiting for sound system to respond"
 Juest: I made the ~/.pulse/client.conf with autospawn=no that is supposed to disable it from autospawning itself.
 celthunder, not that I'm aware of. Pulse is supposed to be completely disabled, afaik.
 Wow. That was lagtastic.
 Did you guys get my last messages?
 celthunder, did you get my last message to you?
 celthunder, you still around?
 Alright, guys.. So I still can't get sound preferences to work.
 Does anyone know how I would set ALSA to be controlled by the sound preferences in Ubuntu's sound menu?
 I keep getting a message "Waiting for sound system to respond"
