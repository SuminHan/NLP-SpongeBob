 And you need to make sure that the bios is set to boot from the usb before the HDD
 A guy in my college class ran into that today
 you may need to be root to access certain folders
 I love sudo, even works in scripts :D
 Herbs I know
 My college has the major networking
 that aint good
 renancoelho: if it was performing filesystem ops, definitely
 booting from live CD should work if there is doubt
 if your BIOS will check the usb and boot from it before checking HDD, then probably
 sandi:I dunno, Shotwell might. I have no idea honestly
 SkrappJaw: do you have a wireless router?
 Herbs: Yes
 cordoval_: I dunno, waiting for release
 I had a similar (i think) problem with the date bar, I just hid some things under settings, then revealed them again cordoval_
 erase your entire drive...
 Herbs: no-one in their right mind would go back
 :P
 cordoval_: that's why it is still "beta", still has bugs
 topramen: what do you have filled out on it so far?
 test ["yum -provides" -eq "apt-cache search"] :P
 Try not to have ports open to everything. And dynamic ports are more secure, but may be more of a hassle. I don't have enough experience to tell for sure
 any idea as to when the sleep/resume issue shall be fixed?
 proq: I dunno if the window managers share that cfg setting
 tripelb: sudo for short-term root priv
 TheHackOps: GET SOME SLEEP MAN!!!
 pythoned: reformatting the disk will erase the data
 So does merely deleting
 TheHackOps: wow
 The best way to remove all traces without destroying the disk is to bleach it
 pythoned: Deleting a file just erases the headers on the clumps (on window$ at least) the files are still there though
 pythoned, the only way to truly destroy data making it completely irrecoverable is to destroy the disk itself
 I do have a problem however, in 10.10 sleep/resume worked properly. In 11.04 on resume I get stuck at a screen with just a command-prompt-cursor like symbol in the top-left corner
 TheHackOps, I know that, my mums from Melbourne
 And I live in America
 People have asked my mom how long it took to drive here
 And some even asked what lang they speak in Australia -.-
 TheHackedOps, I am there (#off-topic)
