 Angelic, use Yelp
 Angelic, there is already a guide for resolving network issues
 Angelic, open a terminal, type yelp
 Angelic, Ill try to help you, what's the issue?
 Angelic, have you tried disabling-re-enabling your adapter
 just uncheck the box "wireless networking" then re-check it
 Angelic, is this new?
 Angelic, or did you just upgrade to natty
 Angelic, install any new software? is this a new adapter?
 Angelic, open Synaptic file manager
 then go File -- History
 Angelic, go to file --> history
 okay, find anything related to kernel updates or your wireless card?
 donkeyinspace, #ubuntu-devel
 Angelic, hold on
 donkeyinspace, no problem
 Angelic, can you try and find the package for your wireless card?
 Angelic, http://packages.ubuntu.com/
 Angelic, not sure, never had an issue like this :/
 Bane99, what'sup?
 Bane99, no, you have to install windows then Ubuntu, or the other way around and boot to a live CD and edit grub
 Bane99, did you install Ubuntu over?
 Bane99, if so Grub will take care of up
 RxDx, terminal based- sudo apt-get install speedometer
 Bane99, we all were once, if you need any help feel free to ask or PM me :-) welcome!
 Bane99, boot from CD, select partition, install, reboot, select what you want to boot to from grub
 Bane99, During the boot up you have to use your keyboard
 bazhang, just meant for him to select it, not create it
 Bane99, yeah
 RxDx, oh sorry didn't see unity, thought you just needed something to view speeds, sorry!
 RxDx, not off the top of my head, check the Ubuntu Software Center perhaps?
 or the forums
 RxDx, no problem, sorry heh
 bison, could you be more specific?
 by the sounds of it possibly a video card issue
 bison, your video card may be broken
 bison, do you just see lines on the display or something of the like?
 bison, verify connectivity of your video card and the cable, test a different monitor if possible and also try booting to a live CD
 k
 frankely, chmod +x filename.file
 in /media ^
 Bane99, 11.04 is new as of a few days ago
 frankely, what is the output?
 or could you be more specific
 frankely, what type of file are you trying to execute
 bison, so video works now?
 bison, okay so did you install some updates recently in your real installation?
 bison, okay so we can presume that that is the issue, let's try to boot into safe graphics mode using the vesa driver
 bison, hold on
 bison, okay boot up and at grub highlight your installation and hit 'e'
 bison, before it boots to Ubuntu, at grub
 bison, what size is your monitor by the way, looking up a code, *resolution size*
 bison, k
 bison, you at the grub loader?
 bison, turn off the computer then turn it back on, before it boots up to Ubuntu it should go through your grub bootloader
 bison, okay boot back up to the live cd
 bison, navigate to your old hard drive, if not available mount it via disk utility
 bison, in a terminal type
 open a terminal and navigate to that hard drive
 then: gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
 bison, actually once on that disk do gedit boot/grub/menu.lst
 not /boot
 ?
 bazhang, oh
 bazhang, I haven't messed with grub in a while, didn't know that changed
 bison, guess that won't work
 bison, Im not sure what the issue is here, it's odd how you don't have the grub boot screen
 buntu, go to #ubuntu-mirrors ?
 buntu, they will be better able to help
 bison, I know, my mistake
 bison, im just confused as to why you don't have even your grub menu displayed on boot
 bison, can you still access /home on your old hard drive?
 bison, I suggest making a backup
 bison, you can use this *let me find the link
 http://www.bootproblems.com/
 I haven't messed with grub in a long time
 so it's not my area of expertise
 chaospsyX, check the ubuntu software center
 bison, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub
 bison, sure you didn't do anything else to cause this issue?
 bison, just the update?
 FHtrain, please refrain from asking the question multiple times in a short time frame, people will help you when they can
 bison, odd, let me look into this more
 mithran, in a sense, it saves all your current memory to disk
 ^ which hibernate does
 FHtrain, okay
 mfilipe, maybe try #ubuntu-devel
 bison, sure
 paste.ubuntu.com
 mfilipe, no problem
 haha
 bison, that works as well
 bison, just use paste.ubuntu.com
 Or1on1, what is the kernel panic, IE what is it spitting out
 Or1on1, what'd you do prior to this?
 hello Guest22646
 Or1on1, Ill try to help you in a second, hold on
 bison, let me edit it for you
 bison, try this: http://pastebin.com/g0FcNV9K make a backup of your old one
 hale, dd if=/dev/null of=/location/to/my/file
 hale, oh just use rm myfile
 hale, np
 hale, okay then use
 hale, dd if=/dev/null of=/location/to/my/file
 gueriLLaPunK, how much ram do you have
 gueriLLaPunK, yes
 np
 gueriLLaPunK, yeah you're good to go
 np :-)
 anadon, find out what partition it is on, boot into ubuntu, and go to disk utility
 anadon, what'd cause it not to boot in the first place?
 anadon, well if it worked and then didn't then something must be up
 hale, Im not sure what you want to do
 anadon, then... *poof* ?
 hale, to empty all content of the file dd it, to remove it, rm it
 hale, that is empty as it gets
 as*
 bison, that fix anything?
 bison, what?
 bison, that new file, replace the contents of your cfg with it, but make a backup of your old one
 ie
 cp file.cfg file.cfg.backp
 cp file.cfg file.cfg.backup
 yeah
 but make a backup first
 Jamescarr locally?
 or a network share
