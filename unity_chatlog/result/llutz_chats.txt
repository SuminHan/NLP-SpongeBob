 bgoldsmith: "id" as actual user lists webdev?
 bgoldsmith: logoff and relogin
 bgoldsmith: how did you add yourself to the webdev-group?
 Herbs: the group has write-permissions, so what?
 Herbs: read this again <bgoldsmith> drwxrwxr-x   6 root   webdev  4096 2011-05-03 10:59 srv
 Herbs: do you need further explanation of that line? owner root, group webdev WITH write-perm
 bgoldsmith: you always have to relogin after changing your groups to make the change active
 bgoldsmith: its the login shell reading the new environment
 bgoldsmith: kind of, all those settings were read when you login.
 bgoldsmith: tbh, i can't explain that in details off hand.
 bgoldsmith: yes but it won't check if those entries are active. "id" does
 pennnn: nobody can answer that. its like "should i go fishing?", your decision
 pennnn: /j +ubuntu+1        to discuss 11.10
 Starminn: its offtopic HERE
 bgoldsmith: "Linux login process" should give some first hints

 grobe: LAcan editing /etc/resolv.conf isn't recommended, use entries like "dns-nameservers 192.168.1.10" in /etc/network/interfaces   (needs package resolvconf being installed)
 LAcan: "auto wlan1" after "iface lo...."
 LAcan: networkmanager has a setting for that
 LAcan: i'm sure, since my netbook using networkmanager has wifi-connection with nobody being logged in
 LAcan: thats nm-applet. networkmanager runs as a service in background after boot
 OneSquared: rename 's/-texte//' *.png

 dr0id: only root or the owner of a file/dir can change permissions
 Jenk: An explanation of what file permissions are and how they can be manipulated can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions
 Jenk: your line: a 64k file, owned by root, group root is read-/write-/executable for everyone and has no hardlinks pointing to it
 Jenk: sudo chown $USER:$USER file
 nerdshell: scr -r
 scp -r
 Jenk: permissions won't change, just user/group
 Dr_Willis: scp has no -d option
 Jenk: sudo chown $USER:$USER file                    file= the filename of your file to change
 Jenk: on what filesystem is the file (vfat/ntfs)?
 Jenk: chown only works on unix-filesystems. for ntfs/vfat you'll have to use mount-options (uid/gid)
 !ntfs-3g | Jenk so it's ntfs most likely
