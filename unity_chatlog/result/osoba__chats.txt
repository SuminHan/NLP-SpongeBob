 hmm can i talk lalala
 i can :O
 the unity sidebar wont hide for some reason
 does anybody have a clue why?
 i just installed ubuntu for the first time and it seems very intuitive and nice except the stupid sidebar that wont auto hide sometimes
 flametai1: its the most recent version
 and gnome is meh
 i am looking at it thanks usalabs
 hmm i did the ccsm thing but the sidebar is still there
 might be due to the slowness of this partition
 its an ide hard drive with a very small partition (8GB)
 its been kinda slow
