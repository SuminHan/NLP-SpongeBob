 updated to 11.04 and unity isnt on by default, when I run unity --rest in ttyl1 and go back to ttyl7 I see unity over top of the old 10.10 desktop any suggestions?
 can anybody recommend a hdd cloning tool?
 Stereocaulon_: kinda hoping for a tool that I can boot into from usb, need to take windows off one hdd and put ubuntu on that one
 Sidewinder1: I'll have a look thanks
