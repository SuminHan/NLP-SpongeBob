 anyone pull off dual boot on an existing macbook pro with the latest ubuntu?
 from a USB
 to boot from the USB to install i mean
 N'Wally: not sure what option boot refers to
 yeah but i need to prep another partition before i do that to install the OS to, don't i?
 k
 why do you say that? my windows install inside a VM is so sluggish that i rarely use it
 macbook pro 5.1 - first gen unibody
 4GB RAM
 2.53GHz c2d
 for windows i used parallels, not VMWare
 hmm ok
 woot VMWare installing now
 oh damn i was trying to dual boot but VMWare is like fucking autopilot...easy as cake...
 anyone got unity working properly within VMWare on a Macbook?
