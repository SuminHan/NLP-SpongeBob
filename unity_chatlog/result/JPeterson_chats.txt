 I upgraded to 11.04 on what I thought was a plain vanilla 10.10, now I'm stuck on the grub command prompt
 To be clearer I get the "Ubuntu 11.04 upgrade stuck on grub 1.97 beta 4 CLI" problem!
 why wont it boot?
 if I do ls /grub there is no grub file!
 if I do "boot" then "no kernel is loaded"
 if I do linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 ro
 then "cannot open root device sda1"
 well this 11.04 upgrade seems to have went well
 first I had to recover grub from the live cd
 then I get "error no suitable mode found"
 and not a single line of boot text
