 Hi, hoping someone can help clarify something for me. Just upgraded to Natty, appear to be suffering from the following (quoted from Release Notes) - "Under certain conditions, on systems equipped with nvidia GPUs, focused or maximized windows may be blank". However, the bug it links to (763680) is as follows
 "Dash appears under full screen apps"
 so my questions, I guess, are as follows - (1) is this fixable? (2) any ideas why the Release Notes appear to link to the wrong bug (or am I missing something)?
 Is anyone else having problems with maximized windows being blank?
 ohsix: all windows, they don't even have to be maximized, just stretched beyond a certain size, and yes I'm using an nvidia card
 ohsix: I linked to the release notes earlier, but it appears to point to the wrong bug (unless I've missed something)
 ohsix: yes, it's an older nvidia card, GeForce 6200 LE
 ohsix: I believe I'm using the proprietary driver. When I installed Maverick it gave me the option to install those drivers, I think. Everything was working fine until I upgraded to Natty.
 ohsix: ok, I will try that. I'll stop bothering you for the moment, but I just want to say I appreciate your taking the time to help me out
