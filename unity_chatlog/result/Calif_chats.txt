 If your doing something like editing a file with vi, and you accidently cntl Z instead of quitting properly, how do you get back to that 'program'. (Keep getting messages about .swp)
 ah
 it just does it chronologically
 Yeah, I noticed something about that actually. I knew there was another way, fg was what i wanted, but I'm writing all these down
 I got a msg to upgrade to natty, is that what you guys are talking about?
 narwhale, nice ;p
 ...
 crap ;p
 I did it earlier, so far all looks good ;p
 but I probably wouldn't notice for a month if it was broken somewhere, I'm still very much learning
 I still don't know how to get my x window shit going, (running cli on ubuntu server)
 That would be local I guess I'm through ssh atm
 although figuring out how to get it working remotely might be worth a go
 If I've got an ip that changes but its a public ip on my linux machine, AND I want to get a dns name for it... say through some service such as dydns/noip - what kind of options do I have?
 ok, so I guess ill look into whether they have a good client for linux/ubuntu
 when I run some commands like make, I frequently get an error - notifications.c:744:13: warning: ignoring return value of âasprintfâ, declared with attribute warn_unused_result
 what does this mean?
 aphexcoil, hello again lol
 I was wondering what happened
 freenodes awesome for that
