 Hi, could someone help me remove Avast antivirus?  I installed it and I have no idea how to remove it!
 I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 32 bit
 Omega: I downloaded the .deb file from their website, and installed it.
 chaos: No, when I double clicked the .deb file, it installed through Ubuntu software center.
 I tried double clicking it again, it opened software center, and I only see an option to "reinstall", no remove.  This sucks, I hate Avast.
 They shouldn't force people like this to keep software we don't want on our computers by not providing an option to uninstall.
 chaos: I tried searching in synaptic but didn't find it.  Via terminal, I didn't find the package name.  Tried typing avast, avastgui etc
 Thanks for your help guys btw, appreciate it :)
 Still here
 The .deb package?  It is in my downloads folder.  If you're asking where it installed, I think it's under Home/.Avast
 cheapie: It's avast4workstation_1.3.0-2_i386
 omega & cheapie:  Thanks guys, I typed sudo apt-get remove avast4workstation and it uninstalled!
 You guys rock, thanks a bunch! :)
 Omega: Thanks , it worked!  Brilliant - thank you!  I'm going to post on ubuntuforums now, on how to do this.
 chaospsyche: no, removed it through the terminal :)
 chaospsyche: sudo apt-get remove avast4workstation worked for me
 Do you guys know which is the best antivirus for Ubuntu?  I dual boot and email files to Windows users, so want to make sure I'm not inadvertently spreading.
 rage: Thanks, will check it out.
 cheapie: Thanks, will check it out.
