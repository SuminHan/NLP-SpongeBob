 ?

 nightwk
 you can not add  widgets
 Anyone here that likes the new Natty is a mac  user or a twitter generation under 20
 I like seeing my file menu and it be part of my window
 I like adding widgets that show my cpu s and weather realtime
 I also like proper dual screen support
 sumyunguy:  please do not you will chuck your mouse at you computer screen
 bitplane:  please install blender and tell me how it behaves for you
 bitplane:  i like to complain live and have it yeild no results
 varunvyas: I told you guys this new edition is not good
 scorch_:  my point exactly
 to be honest the ui design is seriously flawed
 sebsebseb: that's why it is the way it is and the main userbase is getting pissed off about it
 sebsebseb:  ok you got me there lol
 why is blender spanning two workspaces  even in classic mode on my dual screens
 this makes my sooo very angery
 every thing I luanch it I have to manually resize that sh** ?
 :(
 wahhhhh
 people on here are egotistical  there should be free speech  even if it's about unpleasantness and  complaining the wise know it comes from love
 I love ubuntu  as far as 10.10
 NictraSavios: exactly it looks like poor UI design  with no clarity
 researcher123:  warning do not  you will lose features
 bitplane:  you don't understand even classic mode is buggy as far  dual screening  and blender
 bitplane:  also if that is the case and everyone goes back to classic to get it to work correctly and have ubuntu organized  then what is the use of updating
 I head gnome3 is ever worst than unity
