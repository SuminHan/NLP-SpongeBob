 Hi, how can i install an earlier version for an application? I'm trying to Install skype (latest version doesn't work w/ my laptop) but I read on forums that earlier versions worked just fine, but the website shows only the latest version (2.2 BETA) is there like a code option on apt-get to define the version?
