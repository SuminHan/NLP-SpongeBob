 hi, i just installed natty, and the menu bar at the top (that has network, battery info, etc.) has disappeared -- how to get it back?
 just installed natty on samsung series 9 -- working pretty well so far
 ok, figured out answer to my own question -> alt+f2 gnome-panel
 @LittleRed, i just installed it on samsung series 9
 no, worked great out of box
 i had no install issues at all -- installed from USB stick since the laptop has no optical drive
 only issues i'm having are wrestling with compiz weirdness -- just not used to some of these changes
 i have had problems with the upgrades myself
 i've always had better luck backing up my data, and doing a clean install to upgrade
 just got this laptop today, and put natty on it.  it is a sweet piece of HW: http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/28/samsung-series-9-900x-laptop-review/
 SSD, boots to desktop in like 15-20s
 me too...prices will come down soon
 xsinick - right click -> create launcher...
 xsinick: i am using 11.04 too, just right click desktop, create launcher...  follow dialog
 so, what is the official name of the launcher bar on the left side of the screen, and why does it behave so strange (i.e. auto-hides sometimes, sometimes not)
 i'm also seeing weird issue in natty.  if i mouse over window title bar, and click touchpad, i expect to be able to drag, but it won't.  i can drag if i double click title bar and move touchpad.  haven't figured out why yet
 yea, i have ccsm installed, and messed with some things already
 haven't installed chrome on this yet.  since ff4 came out, i'm happy with it
 in compiz -- key bindings might have something like <Alt>KP7 for example, what's KP, i'm guessing short for Key Pad?  what if yer on laptop -- guess have to re-bind that to something else
 bigeye: try <Alt><Tab> to nav through open applications
 if you have compiz enabled, there are lots of other plugins that can do similar.  Try <Super><S>
 bigeye: try <Alt><F2> -> gnome-panel
 what is up with ubuntu software center; try to install skype, "available from natty-partner source", button: Use This Source, click...nada.  doesn't work, can't install.  have to go add sources manually?
 digging the move, resize, snap compiz plugins.  so much more efficient that mac os
 last time i tried cube rotate, it went berzerk-o.  scared to try it again, but i want that
 glow?
 i think there is one that lights your window on fire
 Hello: try troll-hunter
 quint: sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
 nice summary of 11.04 tweaks: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/things-to-tweak-fix-after-installing.html
 awesomestan: i just installed skype on 11.04 without issue
 had to enable partner repo first, but that was it
 y, you can buy skype credits for computer to pots, but it is free for computer<->computer
 gnome-panel dies a lot if you mess with compiz plugin settings
