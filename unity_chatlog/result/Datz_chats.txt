 hi, is there a way to upgrade to 11.04 without unity, more of a minimal upgrade?
 bazhang: yes?
 I don't know how large the Unity package is, but I'd like to avoid downloading it, during the upgrade
 alienkid10: ah, ok I'll look into that, thanks
 Hi, I just want to use Gnome2 and not unity. How can I remove just unity? "aptitude purge unity" ?
 Rehan: it is causing problems though
 I guess I'll try and purge unity and see what it does
 Rehan: ok so it wants to also remove ubuntu-destop
 so that is;nt good
 ny51bern: try safe mode
 ny51bern: do you see a grub boot menu?
 before you get to teh login?
 ny51bern: yes
 or ctl atl del
 Jordan_U: do you know if there is a way to remove unity and just keep Gnome 2 desktop?>
 ny51bern: nope, just boot to safe-mode
 Jordan_U: ok thanks
 ny51bern: try the latest kernels ssafe mode
 ny51bern: that won't solve your problem, but hopefully you'll be able to log in
 ny51bern: I had a freeze before the login, and I was able to boot to safe mode. Now I just want ot remove unity
 Rehan: sure
 np ;)
 ny51bern: ah, ok you have another menu, not grub
 ny51bern: was just there myself repairing grub. but I don't know what your problem is/
 ny51bern: might have to sit tight, I can't really can't help you with that.
 Rehan: I'm going to try and purge unity, and install "gnome-desktop-environment
 Rehan: I'll let you know how it goes :P
 Juest: hum?
 I gyess I don't need to purge unity
 just remove
 Although it doesn't want to let me remove unity without removing ubuntu-desktop
 damn..
 KM0201: is there a minimal gnome2 desktop?
 package
 KM0201: nevermind, I'll search
 KM0201: yea, but I want it gone :P
 KM0201: there is freezing, and I have to boot to safe mode
 KM0201: there is some driver issue
 KM0201: I'm not going to be able to run unity here
 KM0201: so I'm going to remove it
 tis
 KM0201: well it's a VM, so no unity, but gnome2 without unity works fine
 I guess I could probably run unity but ..eh
 luigi_panache: this channel is going to be a bit busy as 11.04 was just released, might ask somewhere quieter
 luigi_panache: there is a special way on larger networks, /list is the usual way. Go as in #help , I forgot
  luigi_panache no problem
 ny51bern: were you having the freezing problem earlier?
 ny51bern: did you try the failsafe graphics mode on the recovery menu?
 ny51bern: strange. well at least it's workin now. Let's hope it stays that way
 ny51bern: ok.
 ny51bern: right now I'm where you were before.
 lol
 ny51bern: I'm contemplating debian :p
 ny51bern: before then for me
 ny51bern: safe mode, recovery, failsafe x, reconfigure graphics restart
 ny51bern: if that recovery menu comes up agian, i'll be in the options
 ny51bern: just select safe mode when you get to the grub menu
 ny51bern: yep all working here now
 ny51bern: are you saying there is a recovery mode?
 or screen*
 ny51bern: ok, then there is a failsafe x option or somethiong like that?
 should be midway
 ny51bern: what is third option down?
 ny51bern: does it say recovery menu at the top, or grub?
 ny51bern: ah ok, try recovery mode. my fault
 ny51bern: ok, try the recovery mode
 ny51bern: failsafeX
 ny51bern: ok
 ny51bern: not yet, but getting somewhere
 yes
 ny51bern: something like default config
 use that one
 should be first I think
 what is the first one?
 ny51bern: reconfigure
 ny51bern: then default
 ny51bern: ok click cancel, what are the options?
 restart x
 ny51bern: I think it should work now.yes
 ok
 ny51bern: strange. well try and restart. if that doesn't work. try low graphics mode for one session
 ny51bern: for me reconfiguring to default x config worked
 ny51bern: strange
 ny51bern: did you upgrade, or do a fresh install?
 ny51bern: did you have any graphics drivers loaded before?
 ny51bern: well, you would have loaded them before.
 ny51bern: humm, well I'm not sure what I can help you with anymore. I'd personally try looking through the recovery options for something
