 Toph: deluge is my opinion as well :)
 JediMaster: deluge has a cli interface as well
 niels1: Hey, regarding your blank laptop screen + intel gpu.. there is some magic kernel option which I entered in grub on my moms laptop, at least for 10.04.
 dmartinng: perhaps becasue you're gfx need drivers to be installed
 ajin: I'm happy for you
 mikebeecham: do you just want to change the wallpaper for gdm or the whole theme?
 mikebeecham: you can either do it with some gconfhacking, but I think this is the easist way: gksudo -u gdm gnome-appearance-properties
 mikebeecham: well that's wierd. hang on
 mikebeecham: http://www.ubuntu-tennessee.org/tutorials/205/ <-- that will make your loginscreen spawn the gnome-appearance windo, so just change the background and login, afterwards you can remove the .desktop from the folder
 it's all in the tutorial
 drdozer: I would try to boot the install-cd again and look for a repair grub option
 mikebeecham: http://www.flickr.com/photos/jackyalcine/5381411916/ <-- gdm wallpaper suggestion
 drdozer: hmkay. either you burn a cd or you create an usb startup disk. Either way, you'll have to boot from some other medium to repare grub
 mikebeecham: here's a solution for you: irssi
 drdozer: depends on the grub error
 drdozer: uhm. I wouldn't know what to type in the situation
 mikebeecham: my irssi aint ugly :P

 mikebeecham: an interface designer ey, have I seen any of your work?
 XBMC :'||||
 and android
 mikebeecham: wow indeed :D
 rpk: what kind of server?
 dunno what that is. but "sudo netstat -anp | grep <port number>" and "sudo iptables -nvL" might help out rpk
 rpk: looks like 7001 only listens on tcp6
