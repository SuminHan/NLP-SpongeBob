 RUNNING=0

 Hey could someone help me out. I'm trying to make a bash script that checks if anything that prevents tor from running is open and then kills the process. The part of the script that works is printf "\n$process is already running as PID $pid\n\n" however if I do kill $pid it comes up with kill 11: Operation not permitted. Could anyone assist?
 What is kill -9? I want to kill the process specified in printf
 That could be the case.
 Thank you ayecee. The issue was the process was running as root. Know anyway I can have it automatically check if the process is running on root or my user and if so get elevated access automatically with a preset password and then close the process?
