 Where would be an appropriate location to create a directory for application data that all users can read and write to?
 Captainkrtek, locally... any user logged into the machine, the application should use that same dir for caching :)
 The way it is is that when a user does something it might download 40MB or so of data to the cache, I'd prefer to share it vs. making each user do that download again
 because the apps default is .appname/cache (which can be configured to elsewhre)
 I'll put it /usr/local/share I guess
