 putty is nice but try mremote on windows
 its awesome
 more complete it allows for rdp, ssh, vnc, rdp
 oops
 rlogin
 and other things, the interface is much nicer plus you can have multiple sessions in one window
 kwtm, im not sure i still use tightvnc if i am honest, the best part for me is the multiple sessions, but i do think the vnc client is built-in
 kwtm: well I also work in a restrictive corporate environment, only place I use Windows, and had no problems, so I am pretty sure you will be fine :)
 kwtm, as said i use it mainly for multiple sessions and the tidyness of the desktop
 kwtm, its a connection manager for putty etc
 kwtm, no trouble lol i should have mentioned that
 exaile?
