 I've installed ubuntu on a machine that runs a nvidia card and drivers arent there by default. I changed to ro nomodeset single and booted into netshell and installed Nvidia drivers. When I try to reboot now I just go into power saving mode. Any ideas?
 ActionParsnip, that didnt work
 ActionParsnip, should it be there by default?
 I mean change the default*
 How do you check the current driver thats being used for graphics?
 shell / gui
 ugh unity

 syockit, it broke one of our systems that runs 3 monitors
 had to roll back to 10.10
 and its by far not a developer desktop
 Also the "classic" version just through errors
