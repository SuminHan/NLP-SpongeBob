 m|kael, does gnome-do work with unity
 m|kael, ok then click add , type gnome-do in name and then below it type the terminal command for it. it should appear at the bottom of the list
 m|kael, ehh one min!
 m|kael, well it works for me you must not be doing something?
 m|kael, gnome-do then gnome-do
 m|kael, did it work then ?
 m|kael, after clicking add did you type the name that you would like at the top and the "terminal command" in the bottom
 m|kael, you add the short cut after that!
 m|kael, ok
 m|kael, i think the main search is a version of that behaves similar!
 Soothsayer, its performing better than the 1010 unity for netbook so far.

 HAKMASTER, they are should be drop down windows
 kate__, my burn got corrupted because i burned too fast !
 HAKMASTER, why are you partitioning to none default for the install? i would do a spare partition no need to call it anything special
 HAKMASTER, sorry not sure then!
 tripelb, which ubuntu are you on ? your hard drive partitions should come up ???GB file system in places
 tripelb, in places  it should show you the partition 9.8GB double click it ..is that what you did ?
 tripelb, also it does not matter which ubuntu was on the partition as long as it was not encrypted
 i have two file systems like yours one with 11.04 and 9.10 and i used the file manager to transfer pics and files from one to the other maybe its encrypted?
 tripelb, try drag and drop with nautilus?

 UserX7, unity can work without additional drivers but if you require wiz bang graphics and such i would enable them.
 UserX7, if you have not enabled them then chances are you are not using them
 Soothsayer, sudo apt-get macchanger. also ifconfig can do it i believe
 UserX7, you could try "system testing "app  from the menu  it goes through hardware testing them will show up anything not working and possible drivers to be installed.
 mikebeecham,  you can ajust windows and other desktop configurations through ccsm
 mikebeecham, it may be but it would effect everything i suspect. perhaps some testing!
 silentz0r, how did you upgrade ?
 silentz0r, have you a live cd just to see if it boots.
 morelli, is it a fresh install from cd ? or a upgrade from update manager
 morelli, does it boot up ok ?
 linuxmonkey, from the site you got the image
 twiggy_, i think its part of the new unity! i thought it was the launcher and menus app. if you push to the left it pops up
 morelli, is your ati driver correctly installed ?
 twiggy_, there maybe a an option in ccsm i dont know.
 morelli, so it works fine with classiic not with unity?
 morelli, you may be able to try it but you will have to disable your graphics card. i think that is what is causing the static you could try a live disk. may work better that way possibly!
 katsrc, build gimp ?
 katsrc, i see.
 is a mtrr problem fixable ?
 KNUBBIG, .bashrc file i think , on the computer your sshing into.
 SoftarPaul, if you have a program running it will not show with your pointer push to the edge of the screen that it is suppose to be and it should pop up
 SoftarPaul, no sorry!
 SoftarPaul, is it the unity interface
 Dr_Willis, good idea i think ill do that!
 Mrokii, i think there is an option in ccsm
 brandonc503, usermod -d /path/to/new/homedir/ username
