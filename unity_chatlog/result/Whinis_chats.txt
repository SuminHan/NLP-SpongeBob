 did anyone else get a bumbed grub on upgrade?
 ultimate_chaos we see you
 Ellipsis753 at login select ubuntu classic at bottom
 Ellipsis753 I don't mind it however after messing with settings for a few hours its not that bad
 Ellipsis753 mostly I just fixed some of the issues with compiz like reenabling cube and my other plugins, got alot of programs working again that broke, and changed some basic settings
 Ellipsis753 fixing the nvidia but helped too
 Ellipsis753 ya, I don't use the nouveau driver as I use wine and game alot. Nouveau is bad for gaming where as the Nvidia driver is good for gaming
 Ellipsis753 maybe, mine broke on update since it was a new kernel and I assume some of the settings changes. I had to uninstall my manual drivers and install nvidia-current
 Ellipsis753 if you have upgraded and didn't have to fix grub good to you though :) mine broke and required a live cd to fix
 How many peoples Grub broke on update
