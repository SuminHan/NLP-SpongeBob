 hi, i don't see the sudo group in the "user sttings" -> advanced -> "user priviledge" window
 how should i add a sudo priviledge to a user ?
 shcherbak, <user> is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
 shcherbak, groups -> adm dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin sambashare
 when i log at root from a user terminal and i want to start a graphical app (as root so) is ther something to do ? because i get errors : ...connection->initialization_error == NULL...
 as*
 i installed xchat on ubuntu 11.4 with unity but now i can't get it back from the dock because it goes in the inexisting system tray
