 Flare183: You can always download Gnome3 or any other DE, for example.
 Will 11.04 see feature improvements in Unity, or will those all be put off for 11.10?
 I mean, bugfixes that border on being new features.
 ohsix: Alright, I was unsure simply because of the massive UI changes and potential for broad bugs in the interface and functionality.
 haha perhaps
 thien: It should work fine with particular exemptions, for example if you have X configured for a particular setup.
 drtg: What particular reason is preventing you from upgrading?
 oh heh
 drtg: Get a bigger hard disk, you'll be glad you did. ;)
 altearius: System, Administration, System Log Viewer
 drtg: Sorry I can't really help, haven't used that version in years, and it's unsupported anyway. :( It's worth it to upgrade, even if just to 10.04.
 praveen: update-manager -d
 praveen: The servers are under heavy load right now though, so be warned.
 bazhang: Wrong command?
 oh :O what is it now then?
