 Hi All.  anyone tried putting VMware on U11?
 vibhav, really?  why is that?
 Yeah, I hear ya.  But why?  I have vmware on a XP box and it works great.
 ok, ok.  I understand the opensource argument, but I'm an RN and I don't have the time to learn a new app if the one I already know works fine.
 I want to run a VM w/ microXP or tinyXP so I can watch netflix on that box.  I had probs getting it running on 10.10.  I've just loaded 11 and wanted some tips before trying again.
 nope
 bastards
 thx for the link vib
 compdoc, no... I'll use the vm from the console
 do you mean that the console connects to the VM via VNC?

 arrgh...  now i'm pissed.  just upgraded? to 11 and it lost my netdrivers along the way!  That machine is hanging above my treadmill, so I always maintain it via VNC.  Now I need to install drivers while walking uphill?!?!  grumbles
