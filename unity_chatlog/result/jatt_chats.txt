 use kubuntu
 at least it doesn't run unity per default
 xubuntu
 games
 11.04 will deliver beta software (unity) so better wait for a next release (if you use your machine for something productive)
 it isn't -> https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/648180
 nope the bug comments have a lot of valid points
 it's beta software
 actually the idea was to include unity in gnome3 but gnome developers were against it, canonical was pissed off about it and decided to put it in his distribution anyway
 gnome shell is a disgrace too
 it doesn't look good on the gtk side, hopefully kde and xfce get better
 gnome 3 disgrace -> http://lwn.net/Articles/433409/
 windows sucks but you cannot deny they have lots of experience in gui design/usability
 windowmaker was sweet too too bad it died
 or fvwm in redhat distributions
 it's not worth it
 stick with a LTS release
 11.04 will have a lot of bugs better wait until it is polished with patches for a while
 you won't tell the difference between 64bit and 32bit unless you have lots of ram and/or run programs with heavy CPU usage
 yes I will try this 11.04 on vbox
 no? I am downloading it from http://releases.ubuntu.com/natty/
 any pointers how to install ubuntu in virtualbox? host ubuntu
 why not
 no there is unity-2d
 should work now
 Oday: better use debfoster and deborphan directly, Computer Janitor is junk
 Oday: yeah that's good but deborphan will probably find more unused packages for you
 64bit is good for servers
 but for the desktop is an overkill
 old news
 Oday: try
 deborphan | xargs -i apt-get --purge remove "{}"
 this will remove them.
 Oday: with sudo of course
 still deborphan finds unused packages which apt-get doesn't
 rapha: yes
 very slow
 rgr: 64bit is a pain in the neck for the desktop. it is excellent for servers running huge applications but for the desktop the wise thing to do is to install 32bit
 rgr: you are right, but for organizations is not rare to see servers running 64bit because their java "enterprise" applications require 64GB of ram :)
 crashanddie: I think you can chose a gnome session instead of a unity session on login, don't give up so fast (I know unity sucks tho)
 nope
 canonical wanted unity and gnome but gnome guys were against it (you know why once you see unity)
 s/and/in
 yeah but canonical doesn't have the resources to maintain unity in the long term, gnome can be hated but they have lots of experience and developers on their side
 ultimately unity will die if they don't provide software that pleases the user
 no matter how smart their idea/architecture is
 there is unity-2d
 g4: is crap compared to gnome do
 Guest7243: -> https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/648180
 64-bit as a long history of trouble in the desktop
 kellnola: o'rly? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/maverick/+source/linux/+bug/659143
 64-bit is a pain in the neck
 anyway
 so the sane thing to do is to use 32bit you won't lose performance or anything
 unless you need lots of ram
 don't upgrade
 no
 uninstall it
 lol not many people use ubuntu
 unity was intended to by an April 1.
 joke
 hehe
 unity is beta
 can you move the unity bar to the bottom?
 the left one
 histo: I guess is not possible?
 histo: I am using unity-2d
 histo: no compiz I guess
 greg_72: dpkg -S
 !mirror
 not anymore
 ubuntu is now a unity distro
 they should create a new distribution gubuntu
 lol
 yes 10.04 is LTS and proven
 if you want to play around then natty is ok
 unity is canonical's own desktop environment
 so you have now gnome, kde, xfce and unity
 completely new environment
 there are no applets in unity
 yes
 no applets no panels
 euclid: yes
 lol
 no love for unity
 there is no 11.04 LTS
 what he said
 eigba: -> https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/648180
 eigba: or you might hate it
 jnye: you cannot
 jnye: you cannot hide it either
 jnye yeah it as also a lot of issues with dual monitors stuff too
 hehe
 where are the iso's md5sums
 the 11.04 hashes are not there
 unity doesn't use compiz
 Sik: at login time you can choose classical desktop or similar it will load gnome
 freaky[t]: download jdk-6u25-linux-i586.bin from oracle's site, install
 Sik: I don't remember either :(... maybe in the login screen you can set it as default?
 freaky[t]: I use it at work, it works fine. If it's for your own use is ok (1 user) but for a machine used by different people maybe is better to use from the repos.
 unity is beta software avoid it if you use your machine for serious work
 see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity

 totally useless
 green_: is to look more like Mac OS

 Sonja: it is not easily configurable
 eigba: -> https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/648180

 crims0n: no, it is a totally new desktop environment
 crims0n: now there is gnome, kde, xfce and unity
 ojii: no
 ojii: you can use gnome, choose it from the login window
 yes
 zelhar: I think it is safe while it's downloading packages
 zelhar: but once it starts to install/configure if you abort it can get messy
 you can switch back to classic gnome
 Tetsuo55: you can't. there are no applets in unity
 Tetsuo55: I know. canonical claims nobody uses applets :(
 thatcode: you can't the bar position is not configurable in unity
 Tetsuo55: I agree I use that applet too
 swordz: you can switch back to the classical interface
 swordz: it's true there is no way to configure the bar position in unity
 Tetsuo55: I think they still have it
 Tetsuo55: but things like the system monitor applet are gone
 mbrochh: yes, unity
 mikebeecham: there is no way to add the home icon to the unity bar
 so you added it?
 heedlu: in unity?
 heedlu: widgets/applets are not supported in unity
 Rigorm0rtis: no
  11.04 is beta
 they just don't label it as such
 hehe
 it's a release to test experimental features, shuttleworth himself said so
 32bit
 [snake]: in the login window you can choose classical
 opengl for icons and windows lol
 andeeeuk: no, it's not possible to edit the top panel in unity
 andeeeuk: yes, you cannot move it for example
 unity
 LANG=en_US.utf8 gnome-terminal
