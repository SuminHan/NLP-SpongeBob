 escott: Is it necessary to do an fsck at every boot? can't this be tuned? I remember Hardy took over 2 minutes in similar situations, but every 30 boots or so
 hi... wanted to ask if it is worth migrating to btrfs at this stage
 escott: was thinking about all those goodies about subvolumes and compression. Seems a good scenario for dualbooting and installing other distros on the same partition. Is it very unstable at the moment?
 escott: LOL!!! You got me...
 escott: to be completely honest I did an install. Have 3 subvolumes at the moment. @32 @64 @home. Works fine, only booting takes ages...
