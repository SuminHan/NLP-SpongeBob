 hi guys
 I am in need of some assistance: upgraded to 11.04 the other day and everything worked fine. Just today when I log in I can only see the desktop background but no panels. How do I fix this?
 do you have any idea openbees?
 kyubutsu: I did what you said but I got "gnome-panel: no process found"
 openbees: I used strg+alt+f1
 because alt+f2 won't work either
 sorry, ctrl :)
 openbees: I fixed it!
 openbees: ctrl+alt+f1 and then type "unity --rest"
 openbees: I don't know tbh but since it looks like we have the exact same problem and it works for me now chances are it will work for you as well
 openbees: let me know if it worked please :)
