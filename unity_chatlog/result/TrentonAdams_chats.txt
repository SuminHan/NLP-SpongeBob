 hi guys.  How do I get rid of unity in ubuntu 11.04?
 cablop: thanks
 anyone know how to make the language selector icon show the country code like it used to?  When I upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 it went away, and now I'm on 11.04 and it's still not there in gnome2
 My gnome looks like the old windows now, with really deep looking buttons and text boxes.  Is that a feature of the newer gnome in 11.04, or can I get looking the way it used to?
 hey guys.  The new ubuntu gnome doesn't look the same.  It looks aweful.  how do I get the old look back?
 carandraug: I already tried ubuntu-classic.  The menu/task bars look really good until suddenly they change to the old style MS windows look with really stand out buttons
 carandraug: this happens during login, something must be messing something up, but I'm not sure what.
 carandraug: you NUT, go to bed.
 carandraug: The funny thing about it, is that my actual windows, all of them, have the proper theme, just the menu and task bars don't.
 carandraug: I get Window manager warning: "" found in configuration database is not a valid value for keybinding "begin_move"
 carandraug: from the console
 carandraug: Sorry if I didn't see your message.  I ran the metacity thing then Ctrl-C it, and nothing worked, big surprise. :P
 hey guys, I'd like to hook into gnome's auto mount system, from a shell script, to be able to back up my android SD card automatically every time I connect.
 Any ideas on how to do that?
 hey guys, I'm using ubuntu 11.04 my whole system is using the standard theme (dark title bars with orange X, etc.  But, my menu system uses it for just a little while, while logging in, then it switches back to an old windows 3.1 style super 3d buttons look.  Any ideas?
 coz_: done that MANY times, doesn't do anything.
 coz_: Not sure, but it was working in 10.10, just a sec, I'll look
 pragmaticenigma: if it was doing that, why do all the other windows work?
 coz_: yes upgrade
 coz_: yeah, was about to do that, just a sec.
 coz_: ATI Technologies Inc Mobility Radeon HD 3650
 coz_: I'm not using the proprietary drive
 coz_: Or, I don't think I switched to that.
 coz_: I deleted .gnome* and that did nothing.
 coz_: but if it was a "driver issue" then why the windows look fine, but the menu/task bar system don't?
 coz_: I'm going to try and do the disable effects thing, and see what happens.
 zvacet: looking, just a sec
 zvacet: I'm going to try disabling effects, then do the new driver.
 be back
 zvacet: Yeah, just the menu/task bar, other windows are fine
 zvacet: even my KDE based windows look great. :P
 any chance ubuntu will ditch unity?
 taglass: yeah, too bad, cause that likely means gnome won't be supported anymore.  And, hence a need to switch distros.  I'm betting ubuntu will lose a LOT of users now.
 jismlicious: Yeah, it "works", but it's not a "bit" of a change, it's mental.  Ubuntu has managed to show apple how dumb-down they can have an interface.  That's just an amzing feat. :P
 parapara: Can you describe why?  Kinda curious, I just couldn't see anything good in it.
 parapara: except the searching of course.
 Anyhow, on a side topic.  I'm sure I used to be able to paste a path into nautilus, when using ubuntu 10, but I can't figure out how to enable that option now.
 taglass: thanks, did that change?
 taglass: Also, is there a way of having it work by double clicking the location bar, like it used to work?
 taglass: I think it was a habit that I developed, so I do think that used to be a feature, hmmm.
 taglass: thanks for the ctrl-l thing though.
