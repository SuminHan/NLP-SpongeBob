 I wonder if perhaps I might not be totally hated for asking if anyone CANNOT see http://godmode.cc showing up?
 having strange intermittence issue
 celthunder: thanks for your help, that will intermittently fail - do you know what test that tool performs underneath the surface?
 celthunder: roger that, same here, thanks for the quick peer review I appreciate it
 celthunder: I have many different clients using that test regime so I am glad for corroboration - weird error to troubleshoot
 celthunder: my team has changed its multi-homing routing strategies and optimized at the router level to rule out intermittence there, iptables also checked and not blocking traffic; I am technically running ubuntu 10.10 so this is "channel legit," it is odd because certain networks cannot see a certain IP subnet, but can see another, on the same virtual image
 celthunder: we pretty much have it narrowed down to being a combined issue caused between outside networks and that configuration change at the router level, but now I need to do regression testing
 celthunder: sort of like trying to raise the dead to see if the person was really alive to start with
 celthunder: except trying to kill something that ought never have been alive :)
 no GSP won
 as did machida
 GSP beat Shields
 GuyCanada: no
 np
 celthunder: thanks, our grid is pretty large and my guys are on salary so if they cannot fix it i need to fire people, otherwise I would take you up on that
 celthunder: fill out godmode.cc!
 celthunder: since it works
 celthunder: for now :)
 celthunder: I would gladly take you up on that because I have infinite work ahead for next several years
 celthunder: all capacities of technical ninjality
 sorry to be a pest, does anyone NOT see http://godmode.cc/ ?
 I had someone not see it earlier
 I need to rule out multi-homing configuration errors on ubuntu 10.10
