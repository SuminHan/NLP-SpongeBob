 jaredquinn: there isn't even one likeable aspect to unity. not for me anyway. don't worry, I feel the same about gmone3 also. I have no idea what the UI designers think they are doing, but they are not building anything of value.
 I'll torrent the new release for a while. Should help as its a 100MB connection.
 I'm not.
 Unity isn't for me.
 Not unless it goes through a sever amount of adding configurability to it.
 gnome 3 isn't for me either.
 nope
 I have not liked much now for a long time. I think most of the desktop direction is wrong, is bad, and seems to be being built for tablets, not desktops.
 er... distrowatch say its released
 jeez. I am so hating unity.
