 hi, does anyone know how to make the unity launcher permanently visible?
 it doesn't always show when I move my mouse cursor to the left side of the screen
 so I would prefer it to be visible at all times
 I just can't find any setting to make that happen
 ah, it was in compiz-settings.
 boot: java has nothing to do with javascript
 rzx237: yeah it can be configured graphically too

 from what I've heard of it, gnome 3 is a train wreck
 boot: are you not hearing/reading me
 boot: I already said java has nothing to do with javascript, so how do you figure installing Java would help with Javascript issues?
 boot: enable javascript in settings
 boot: in the content tab
 boot: then the website is probably doing something wrong -- what site is this?
 boot: yeah the website seems broken
 not much you can do about it
 boot: in firefox?
 boot: for the last time, this has nothing to do with Java
 boot: the website has an error -- it's looking for the "txtPassword" element when it should be looking for "txtpassword"
 boot: a simple programming error
 not the fault of your browser
 boot: in firefox?
 boot: I just tried in Firefox 4.0.1 on Windows, it does not work
 boot: I get the same error
 boot: not for me
 boot: I don't get the error on IE8 though
 boot: fails here on firefox 4.0.1 with java 6 update 25
 boot: I cannot fix the site for you -- try any other site and you will see that javascript is enabled and working fine

 KM0201: try any combination
 ActionParsnip: so it doesn't work on chrome after all?
 ActionParsnip: yup, javascript disabled please enable
 on any browser other than IE
 boot: that's what I thought too
 boot: I already explained what the problem is
 did you miss that line?
 ActionParsnip: not my problem...I'm helping boot out here
 boot: because internet explorer works case insensitively with document.getElementById()
 the others do not
 main what?
 boot: yes, like I told you already.
 I don't understand why people use Internet Explorer so much in India
 and China too
 Jasonn: that has what to do with browser market share?
 boot: yes but clearly that site was only tested with IE
 boot: nothing really
 yeah we heard you the first time
