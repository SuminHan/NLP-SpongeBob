 so if we have beta we just update on update mangaer?
 I am hating banshee, any idea how to make i tunes podcasts work?
 xangua, yes but then what is the point of having an add a podcast button on Banshee. Plus i am trying to add the podcast to my mp3 player.
 Anyone having issues when closing banshee? It always crashes on me
