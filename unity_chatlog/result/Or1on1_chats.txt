 I just upgraded to 11.04 and I'm getting kernel panic after login on my asus G51
 I'm getting kernel panic on 11.04 64bit after login on ubuntu... does anyone have this problem?
 Captainkrtek, there is nothing on the logs. its a total freezup with the keyboard light blinking...
 Captainkrtek, I can log in using ubuntu safe mode option. I just upgraded, this happened at the first login.
 Captainkrtek, thanks! :)
 Captainkrtek, i think i found a clue for the freezup! :o)))) i think its one of the startup applets/applications
 Captainkrtek, it was the cdemu deamon
 :o)
