 Did anybody manage to get natty installed on a macbook pro 13"? When upgrading it left me with a kernel panic. Would like to know if clean reinstallation would work
 jw_: i have seen this and am not aware of a fix (havn't looked either tho)
 jw_: if you do find a fix, let me know ;)
 When you hit super in unity, it gives you these nice numbers for the apps. That doesn work for Chromium. Is there a fix? Also, how is that number-feature called?
 ActionParsnip: just did the very same thing
 ActionParsnip: ok i had to restart chromium
 ActionParsnip: kind of, yes

 Any idea why my internet connection is SO slow under ubuntu on my macbook pro? Under OSX is fast, and for another computer it is also fast. Both wifi and wired connections are affected
