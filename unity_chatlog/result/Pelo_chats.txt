 OMG, it burns, how do i get back to vanilla gnome ?
 all my calendars now start the week on saturday , this is effing ridiculous
 anyone know where I'M suppose to change the first weekday now ?  /usr/share/i18n/locales isn'T it apparently
 DJRoby4, did you have ubuntu working before ?
 sidewalk, read up, he did ask
 Sidewinder1, , he did ask , read up
 DJRoby4, anything odd about your hardware ?
 DJRoby4, the nvidia raid stuff is out of my leaque but that shoudln'T matter at this point,  wher you able to run a live session ?
 DJRoby4, , when you get that blinking cursor, can you type anyting or it is just a timer ( busybox) ?
 DJRoby4, I 'll wait , just  say my nick when you come back to it hightlights me
 DJRoby4, I won'T wait an hour
 KNUBBIG, irssi has a nice channel of their own
 DJRoby4, ,ok , are you sure (don't be insuslted just checking) that you are installing the correct version for your hardware ( ie 32/64 bit )
 DJRoby4, that should work but I would recommend you try the 64 bit one,  in anycase I was going to suggest that you try a second install using the alternate install cd,   it's text based ( looks like the old dosshell)  and it used to be slightly more reliable when you had install problems with the live version
 DJRoby4, oh sorry I thought you wanted the computer to work ...
 DJRoby4, it happens that the installer will go all the way to the end but something goes wrong in the install and it won'T boot properly,  in such cases reinstall , using the alternate install cd if possible
 DJRoby4, there are to many things that could be responsible during the boot process, Reinstall is the only option that makes sense, you could try just reinsalling again,  from the  cd, don'T boot the live session, just go straith to the installer,  to a 100% clean install, ei whipe the hdd and start from scratch ( obviously you'd have to backup your data)
