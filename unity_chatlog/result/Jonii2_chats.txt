 hey, I'm using ubuntu studio and I just updated to 11.04.  Now when i boot up, it tells me me hardware isn't up to date enough to use unity, witch is a joke in itself.  Then, it makes sure i don't have a mouse and i can't use the keyboard to get past the error message.  As soon as i boot, it gives me an error message with no way to get out of it.  can anybody help me or is my comp foobared...
 ...yet again?
 Dr_Willis: well the drivers were installed fine just before i upgraded.... now it doesn't matter as i can't get in
 Dr_Willis: how am i supposed to do that? it never gives me a chance to boot to the console
 Dr_Willis: ok, i'll do that. what do i type in to fix it though? I'm new to linux
 Dr_Willis: alright i'll try that be back in a few
 hey thanks so much Dr_Willis I got in to ubuntu now.
 but still, i don't get why it thinks i can't use unity
 I have the nvidia drivers for my graphics card... and i could run unity without a problem, but ubuntu once again has decided that its smarter than me. any help?
 bc81, I'm probably going to end up reinstalling
 Why is ubuntu telling me that my hardware isn't good enough to use unity, even when i have great specs and graphics drivers installed?p
 I know i can run it, but ubuntu has decided its smarter than me yet again
 Why won't linux let me use unity? its telling me my hardware isn't good enough when its sooooo more than good enough.
 arand: yep, i just reinstalled them
 arand: ima restart here and see if it helps.... brb
 ok so i reinstalled my graphics drivers and now ubuntu isn't even giving me errors OR a choice, it just sends me to ubuntu classic. I REALLY WANT UNITY lol
 arand_: I reinstalled drivers but it won't even let me try unity now, it just sends me straight to classic :(
 DosAmp: I have an NVIDIA GTS 250 with the drivers on my computer.  I can run any game i choose with max settings, so hardware isn't an issue. I'll try logging out and back in, but last time i check, Ubuntu (unity) wasn't even on the list
 DosAmp: just as i thought, ubuntu refused to give the option of booting to unity
 DosAmp:  Ubuntu, Ubuntu (classic) ubuntu safe mode, theres a lot of options but not unity
 PalinBachman2012: lol not in this case, its sending me back to the old style if i pick just ubuntu
 unless unity looks EXACTLY like old ubuntu without compiz
 PalinBachman2012: I'll try that i guess
 PalinBachman2012: how do i enable unity from the compiz settings?
 PalinBachman2012: I know but i can't find unity on here'
 PalinBachman2012: and when i search it comes back with nothing
 PalinBachman2012: yep i installed that and i can't find unity, but i know i upgraded.... the first time i booted it told me my hardware wasn't good enough to run unity and wouldn't let me close the error box...
 PalinBachman2012: hang on.... i found it in ubuntu software center so i'm installing it through there
 PalinBachman2012: I have the Nvidia GTS 250 1GB and yes, restricted drivers shows up, works, and i have the drivers and the nvidia control panel.  games work great, but this doesn't.
 PalinBachman2012: hang on
 PalinBachman2012: I SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol
 PalinBachman2012: thanks dude, your the only person so far who hasn't told me to fix everything by opening the console, im gonna relog and see if it works now
 PalinBachman2012: thanks so much... unity works, almost. 2 issues, and one might not be an issue. First, ITS BLINDINGLY WHITE!!!! where can i go to change it back to my old theme?
 PalinBachman2012: tensorpudding: yeah thats what i thought... but i'm really confused cause i can't find my appearance settings
 ok well the bar at the top is still white, and so is chatzilla... but it has a dark theme :(
 and i can't move the appearance window around
 WOW ok so my theme only half works, most thinks are a terrible shade of grayish white. and if i unmaximize windows, i can't move them
 tensorpudding: sure hang on
 ok well i'm uploding the picture but its gonna look funny cause i have to screens
 tensorpudding: do you have teamviewer? my picture doesn't want to upload lol
 oh i think it worked
 http://img171.imageshack.us/i/badcolors.png/
 thats what my desktop looks like, its weird though because i have 2 monitors
 tensorpudding: alright i'll try that
 tensorpudding: ok well its better, but the menu bars have black text on a black bar and i can't change it, and i still can't move windows by draging their bar. is there a new way to do it now?
 tensorpudding: no nothing happens
 tensorpudding: the buttons work but even if i right click > move it won'd move the windows
 PalinBachman2012: -.-
 tensorpudding: nope
 hey, ok so i disabled my other monitor and STILL i have black text on a black menu bar and STILL i can't move any windows
 PalinBachman2012: yes
 PalinBachman2012:  ok so its just this theme that is broken, other themes work ok, but still i can't move windows
 PalinBachman2012: ugh
 PalinBachman2012: I upgraded
 tensorpudding: Well i'm using the Ubuntu studio theme but i can switch to other ones and the text looks ok, but nothing fixes my frozen windows
 tensorpudding: nope that did nothing
 tensorpudding: alt doesn't do anything at all
 tensorpudding: yep the mouse works, it works the same with/without alt
 tensorpudding: linux is soooo confusing
 PalinBachman2012: i suppose that was a bad idea, to upgrade
 tensorpudding: ok, relogging
 tensorpudding: hmm?
 tensorpudding: i just got back lol
 tensorpudding: well i did your command and it didn't fix anything, but my configurations weren't changed much from default
 tensorpudding: but when i made a new account it works fine
 tensorpudding: maybe i typed in your command wrong or something
 :( oh well i guess i'll just make a new account thats NOT named testing :D and use that, as long as it works
 tensorpudding: ok i'll try that, how do i delete  them?
 PalinBachman2012: I can move my windows on a new user account, and my theme looks.... terribly designed but thats not your guyses fault
 tensorpudding: ok, i did that, ima relog
 ok
 tensorpudding: ok i'll get rid of that one to
 tensorpudding: what about gconfd?
 tensorpudding: alright thanks, relogging
 tensorpudding: your my new best friend ever! you fixed it!
 tensorpudding: still, terrible black on black menu bar but thats studio's fault not yours
 tensorpudding: omg epic sadface
 tensorpudding: to get the unity bar to pop out i have to put my mouse at the left side of my left screen, and it pops up on the left side of my right screen :(
 tensorpudding: maybe not, i think i can swap my screens so my main is on the left and secondary is on the right, then it won't be bad
 tensorpudding: thanks dude, your awesome, and you actually told me to use the filemanager instead of some super long terminal command. :D alright i need to go bask in the new Unity awesomeness, see you later
