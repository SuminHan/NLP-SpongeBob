 A lot people have been having issues with Nvidia and Unity.
 This isn't the first time I've heard this error
 I really like Unity. It's the reason I came back Ubuntu
 Great work, developers
 Of course I may be the only person on the Internet who thinks this
 I must be a target audience, go me.
 I cant wait for Unity2d so I can use it on geriatric laptop here
 oooo I can have it now? Cool
 sss314: if you have the right hardware 11.04 flies
 VirtualBox doesn't have 3d accel, thus no Unity
 ah, things you learn
 ah ok
 I just installed Unity 2D...nice!
 I think you'll feel pain, though.
 define "strengely"
 or even strangely
 hows your battery?
 hmmm
 My spare laptop is at the low end for Unity so I just use Unity 2D
 no cpu spikes
 varun: in Unity?
 /usr/share/sessions ?
 soreau, I have /usr/share/xsessions
 soreau, right. Does it show all the sessions?
 so you select Unity, log out, login and it doesn't change?
 soreau, check and see if you have a /etc/gdm/custom.conf
 soreau, Is is this a new install or upgrade
 soreau, sounds like something went wrong during install.
 soreau, got me
 soreau, you know it might be controlled by $GNOME_PREFIX/share/gdm/defaults.conf
 I'm not sure though
 I dont think so
 I think it just makes a playlist
 victorhugo289, I think your safe
 victorhugo289, good to hear!
 Glycan, gotta be a little more specific than that
 Glycan, what does the prompt say?
 Glycan, and what do you choose?
 try it with "Brasero"
 I love Unity.
 ya it has quirks but it's mostly awesome
 bull9408, why do want to do that?
 bull9408, if you installed it via apt, just go to Synaptic and uninstall it
 Joker_77, had back turned, eating
 bull9408, it does
 eiriksvin, try Unity2D ;-)
 bull9408, my pleasure
 bull9408, unless you are crunched for disk space, don't worry a bout those. they're harmless
 bull9408, what splash scrren?
 eiriksvin, I'm not sure. My untiy 2d install is that work
 bull9408, did this start after you installed that software?
 let me scroll up and see what you installed
 Joker_77, ah yes
 bull9408, you can try autoclean. sudo apt-get autoclean
 bull9408, it's part of apt-get. it should just be "sudo apt-get autoclean"
 bull9408, yup so it found nothing. That was a long shot. Try uninstalling everything you installed, what you listed
 noob, whats your problem?
 noob, I hear upgrades from the 11.04 beta are hit and miss
 noob, I don't know why. They just seem to be. I wouldn't have recommended it myself
 Radios, that's a civil fraction. It's not illegal
 but then again, don't feed the troll
 I hear ya
 QuartZo, I love Unity
 As a matter of fact, I installed Unity 2d on my older laptop
 "Unity Freak Of Nature" is the name of my new band
 funnylookinhat, I think it's a bug with gtk and Unity because the Gimp acts the same way
 _jw what?
 _jw, I'm not sure it's officially a bug but I've heard this before
 logesh, what?
 ah someone got it
 logesh, you want to create a new channel?
 You create one anytime but for it to stick you need to apply for one
 ask in #freenode
 do you have cookies enabled?
 "one ubuntu to rule them all."
 I love Unity.
 LAcan it should it do it automatically.
 LAcan, is this a Windows CD?
 LAcan and you are in Ubuntu?
 LAcan, that's weird. When I put in a CD it appears om the desktop.
 LAcan what sudo apt-get install gnome-network-manager doesn't work?
 LAcan, OOOOOH
 absolutely
 logout, select your session, log back in
 salomonv, is it in Unity2d? Nvidia drivers?
 salomonv, you have to install unity2d manually. Yeah, Nvidia is a problem right now.
 chrome: because Gnome3 sucks :-)
