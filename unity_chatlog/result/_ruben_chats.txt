 paddy_: that's a common issue with raid5
 paddy_: yes, the disks are the limiting factor
 paddy_: with raid5 over 3 disks, the read actions are nicely spread over all 3 disks, the writes however results writes on 2 or even 3 disks simultaneously: not much performance gain over a single disk
 paddy_: more disks ;)
 paddy_: though write performance will never be really great with raid5, if you want both read and write performance, go for raid10
 paddy_: it also highly depends on your io patterns
 paddy_: the real performance gains with raid5 are when using a hardware raid controller with a battery backed write chache
 cache
 paddy_: or use SSDs ;)
 paddy_: only highend hardware raid controllers can use ssds as cache (and you'd need an enterprise class ssd for that as well), zfs can use ssds as cache as well though
 paddy_: wont make a difference afaik
 paddy_: when write performance is needed, one usually just doesnt use raid5 :)
 paddy_: it all comes down to your needs/wishes/wallet basically, but raid10 is quite likely to give you much better write performance than raid5
