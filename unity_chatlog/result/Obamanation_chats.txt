 lo0m: i apologize if i'm making you repeat yourself (just joined a minute ago) but how come it's not an option?
 lo0m: ooh okay, yeah i may have a difference of opinion on one count, but anyhow, is it windows or ubuntu that you set up in VM
 lo0m: perfect. install apt-to-cd (or something like that) and it make a burnable image of your installation that you can do a "fresh" install with
 lo0m: it saves all packages you have installed and does not add any you removed. it will not, however, save documents or media of any kind
 lo0m: anytime :)
 lo0m: it will create an image of your 10.10 but you can just do the upgrade process afterwards.
 anyone know how to remove an applet from the panel that won't open a context menu?
 Robert__; red2kic: you can also overwrite the PC bios with grub (-_o) not recommended unless you know what you're doing
 ddddddddddd: kde is best suited for learning how linux works and how to develop for it
 ddddddddddd: have you tried entering it from grub's shell?
 ddddddddddd: i know of a dirty way to make that happen
 ddddddddddd: make the command auto-run in a terminal via saved session every time you cold boot
 ddddddddddd: not sure i understand what you're asking
