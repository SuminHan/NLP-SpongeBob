 Stameni, you can configure that in ccsm.
 xangua, that's not true. It's just configured not to display icons except predefined ones.
 Stameni, look in ccsm. You'll find it. Or in dconf-editor. It is possible.
 Stameni, it's not a bug. We don't like the abuse of notification area and want to change that behaviour.
 Stameni, but it is configurable. You can change it if you really want to have it that way, but I can't recommend it.
 Stameni, yes, unless you configure them to be exceptions. Preferably, they'll provide their own indicators instead.
 Stameni, I think notifications should notify you of something. That's not the case today, so it needs to be changed.
 Stameni, also we would like to have an intelligible system, which means that features acts in the same ways. Indicators achieve that. Notifications doesn't.
 Stameni, I've been trying to tell you that it is no problem to do it. You just need to add the name of the command, and it'll be added to the indicators as you expect. Skype is a preconfigured exception.
 Stameni, it may be a dconf setting. Let me have a look.
 Stameni, no. 1) Install apt://dconf-editor 2) look up /desktop/unity/panel. You'll find it there.
 Stameni, it should be self-explanatory, but if not, ask again :)
