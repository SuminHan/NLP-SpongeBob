 Request for help: I just upgraded to 11.04 on my Dell Inspiron 1720. It says it doesn't see any network devices. I have the latest broadcom driver installed(99% sure) and it won't detect any wireless networks or even the ethernet cable. Please help?
 Any thoughts on my lack of networking..?
 OK, I guess I'll leave since I'm getting ignored...

 !broadcom
 Where I'm confused is that everything was working fine before the upgrade. Also, because ethernet isn't working I can't apt-get/use package managers. Is there a way that I can just de-upgrade? Everything was working fine...
 Annoying that it was a recommending upgrade, then. Is there a way to safely go backwards?
