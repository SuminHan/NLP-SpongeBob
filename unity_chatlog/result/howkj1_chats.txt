 I have external usb hard drives and am trying to format them after a failed attempt at software raid 1.... now gparted is complaining that the device /dev/sde1 is in use and I can't format it
 it isn't mounted
 root@Stealth1:/home/howkj1# pvs
   Couldn't find device with uuid 'IgWiAe-ksXG-YKEd-lnGV-m0Fz-8U5M-0UauYZ'.
   PV             VG     Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree
   /dev/md_d0     datavg lvm2 a-   931.51g 931.51g
   unknown device datavg lvm2 a-   931.51g 931.51g
 can anyone direct me to a channel for lvm removal / hard drive formatting issues? -thanks... using Ubuntu 10.04
 Defusal_ : try : sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
 Defusal_ good point
 Defusal_ : you could append... are you using sshd?
 Defusal_ : so you could restart your network with the previous line and then use pipe " | " .......
 Defusal_ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart | /etc/init.d/sshd restart
 pipe should run both commands at the same time
 you might test it first
 Defusal_ if you are running a critical connection
