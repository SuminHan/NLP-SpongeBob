 Since installing Ubuntu 11.04 my login time (for gnome) has slowed down significantly.
 any way to fix this?
 ouss999, agreed
 rizzuh, it's relatively stable, bit buggy on dual screens tho
 rizzuh, I disagree, I have had good experience with gnome.
 I have used ubuntu on dual and tri screens with no issues
 rizzuh, oh yeah same here with Catalyst Control centre, but hardly linux's fault.
 exactly.
 the only good thing for me that came from 11.04 is compiz grids and refreshed versions.
 I would choose unity for netboots/laptops but definitely not my desktop and I hate that they're going to remove gnome  (easily installed tho)
 Future version of Ubuntu: Gubuntu? Ubuntu for unity, Gubuntu for Gnome?
 Must say, a lot of back lash towards unity.. hopefully the next version will be better e.g. you can arrange icons, position the bar.
 rzx237, check the manual page
 kavurt, sudo apt-get install unity
 yeah that kernal better panic with unity on it's system
 right I'm out, later.
