 How can I update my exiting RythmBox to next stable version using terminal ?
 bazhang: yes:
 bazhang: the volume seeker of rythmbox 0.12.8 in the default LTS installation is buggy. I just want to install the newer one.
 bazhang: any idea ?
 syockit: bazhang: which player do you guys use ?
 syockit: bazhang: syockit weird, you don't listen to music. anyways i'm downloading this .tar.gz of rythembox 0.13, i need to overwrite the existing one.
 downloaded this "executable-mynotex-amd64_1.1.4.tar.gz" which contains a single executable file called mynotex, but it wont run after extraction ??
 syockit: yes, not a directory, just a executable file
 executable (application/x-executable)
 syockit:  cannot execute binary file
 ubottu: lol
 DocPlatypus: mynotex: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.4.0, stripped
 DocPlatypus: 	        not a dynamic executable
 bazhang: which has the best sound quality. i mean sound corrections or sth like that :?
 syockit: ok, i will install audacious'
 syockit: yes, i am searching
 syockit: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rhythmbox/+bug/472985
 but how to  put a backport patch ?
 jemark: 0.12.8
 jemark: :(, been in isolation
 jemark: where is version 2.90.1? http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/rhythmbox/0.13/
 syockit: huh!!
 jemark: is there really 2.90.1. I need to download it ?
 jemark: it belongs to Gnome 3
 syockit: yes, i should see the glib updaets
 syockit: no
 when i try to ./configure in conky, it says "Can't locate your X11 installation"
 Pici: thanks i just did. apt-get, it worked this time
