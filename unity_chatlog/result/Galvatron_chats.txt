 RAMPKORV: sudo servide gdm (or kdm) stop
 RAMPKORV: *"service" of course
 geekyogi: Or you can alway reinstall 10.10. There's no need to hurry to 11.04, unless it has a solution for some citical issues you have.
 thanos: We're not Nostradamus.  Define "problem".
 Sexygurl2furl: Long-Term Support
 thanos: Whate filesystem are they?
 AmuletOfNight: If you have all the latest updates you already have the final release
 AmuletOfNight: As I said, get all the latest updates and you are no longer beta. I'm personally using a beta install CD for my 10.10 and just update the stuff to the actual version. That's all.
 sfdsafdsafdsa: How are we supposed to know? Ask in the Arch channel, If you don't think this question is kinda weird.
 abys: For nVidia best download the .run file from their website to your homedirectory, then Alt + Ctrl + F1 --> sudo service gdm stop --> sudo sh ./NVIDIA-Linux_x86-270.41.06.run When the installer is sone, just restart X.
 abys: To remove it just use "./NVIDIA-Linux_x86-270.41.06.run --uninstall" instead.
 abys: It will be fastest to just download the 11.04 .iso
 abys:Installing it from a scratch will be 2-3x faster.
 abys: Do you have just one partition for system and /home + data?
 I truly admire yourcourage, trying to install a freash and potentially problematic system on such setup.
 abys: Do NOT touch Natty unless you make a separate partition for the main system.
 abys: No. Download Gparted LiveCD and create an 8192MB ext4 partition. That's all.
 Then, during the installation just choose the manual partation setup and use the 8GB one as "/" mount point", and the second one as "/home" mount point (obviously do NOT mark /home for formatting).
 skulltip: Mac is Mac, and it is Linux that copies its features.
 My Ubu 10.10 (GNOME) is modified to be a Win/Mac hybrid.
 phoenixsampras: Unity looks this way because it was designed for tablets and netbooks and it's much different from OSX interface.
 aguitel: sudo apt-get synaptic && gksu synaptic will be the easiest way.
 tomekh: sudo apt-get synaptic && gksu synaptic will be the easiest way.

 bittyx-laptop: Log out and choose "Ubuntu Classic"
 Drumm96: In terminal type: sudo dpkg --configure -a - it will finish yhe uncomplete job.
 ayrton: First of all, chceck if there are some options like "Classic" or "GNOME" in the session menu of login screen.
 _Mr_Proper_: I' also read that the default Ubuntu burning backend - "wodim" - is kinda problematic, and oerally not too good, and so it's better to install "cdrtools" from a PPA.
 _Mr_Proper_: Tou might also try getting rid of wodim.
 _Mr_Proper_: Try things like Brasero, Gnome Baker or K3B
 _Mr_Proper_: Of course, K3B is not exactly recommended for GNOME as installing it means a mess with downloading a lot of KDE components.
 KatronixSerf: All you need to do is installing all  the latest updates and you are home.
 ebieste: What is your video card?
