 i just tried upgrading from to 11.04. the upgrade failed. it froze. Is there any way to resume or restart the installation? It died at configuring udisks
 genupulas: I didn't abort it though. The kernel panicked, the display and peripherals froze, and I manually turned off the machine. It's running 11.04 now as if everything is fine
 genupulas: but everything is NOT fine because it didn't complete installation.
 yigal: its because you consented to let it overrwrite your vimrc file
 maybe it installed another one that has higher priority in your environment
 damn it... why did I upgrade just to have these stupid new panels imposed on me
 jiohdi: do you have any idea how to re-upgrade? Mine did not compelte.
 jiohdi: thnaks, I'll try
 jiohdi: it told me to run dpkg --configure a.... oy vey
 jiohdi: it's doing it... just taking forever as expected. it's just that its 3AM here
 jiohdi: I'm used to Arch Linux idiosyncrasies and updating things incrementally
 jiohdi: i'll try to remember that
 jiohdi: well, I tried apt-get update and upgrade and it thinks everythnig is fine
 jiohdi: but what does it know
 jiohdi: everything reads nominal
 11.04, natty, etc
 jiohdi: not sure. the upgrade failed at configuring udisks with "5 minutes remaining" for the entire upgrade process. The system completely froze. I had to manually restart
 jiohdi: not that I can tell, but it's still significant that it didn't finish, dont you think? it means there are now possibly dependency problems
 no
 jiohdi: then I'm totally confused about what it was doing.
 yigal: nothing to upgrade, it says
 i am skeptical
 it bombed, for heavens sake
 yigal: that file doesnt exist for me
 nevermind
 typo
 yigal: no, it's there. I just had a type-o
 yigal: nothing unusual is recorded in the log. it doesn't contain anything about the upgrade procedure
 yigal: can't find anything.... the date's not in any of the files. I grepped them all
 i did
 thanks yigal
 yigal: suddenly, after toggling the zoom compiz plugin off and on again, now screen isnt updating.
 yigal: I think tomorrow I'll just do a fresh install
 yigal: there are no records of any problems
 yigal: I can't pinpoint anything
 ok, thanks
 i switched over from Arch because I was spending too much time administering the system :)
 brb... Im going to simply try to log out/in just to get X working again
