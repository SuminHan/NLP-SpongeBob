 Anyone know of a good way to partition ubuntu for a 64GB SSD with a 640GB for storage?
 Yeah that's what I meant escott :)
 Logs etc are in /var/log correct?
 I was going to put /tmp on the hard drive, as I only have 6 GB of ram and I host a few vm's as well
 What other partitions should I look at moving to the hard drive?
 So how is 11.04 support with multi monitor then?
 I'm a little hesitant to upgrade from 10.10
