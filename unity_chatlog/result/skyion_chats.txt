 Hi Guys
 is there a problem with the ubuntu repo? http://paste.ubuntu.com/602636/
 I have tried the za and gb and main mirror but seems to always bomb out on http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com natty/main
 Herbs: tried clearing cache & different mirrors but same problem.
 apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/*
