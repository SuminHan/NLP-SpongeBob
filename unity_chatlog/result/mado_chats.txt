 hello
 whom do i have to report a wrong time on my computer (ubuntu 11.04) ... you see -> at the "clock" you can set a few times from various time zones ... i noticed one to be totally wrong so far (or since when does the East coast of the US almost use the same time as e.g. the UK does?)
 usr13, ... am new to ubuntu ... how do i go about that?
 one moment ... i'll be right back
 sooo usr13 ... am sorry . .. i head to answer the phone and wait for an order ... ... am back now
 usr13, ?
 usr13, ... am back ... sorry it took me that long
 you said something about my hardware-clock ... but how can my clock be wrong? ... mine shows the real time ... the time for e.g. Houston, TX, USA is totally wrong
 usr13, (and others) you said something about my hardware-clock ... but how can my clock be wrong? ... mine shows the real time ... the time for e.g. Houston, TX, USA is totally wrong
