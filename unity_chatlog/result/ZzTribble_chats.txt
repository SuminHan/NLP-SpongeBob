 Anyone else having lag on compiz after uptime for a day or so
 Also nautilus is heavily leaking memory on my system.
 nikolai`: you might be having an issue similar to me.. when i move windows around, wobbly windows lags. But only if i havent restarted in a day or so
 nikolai`: so i guess the question is.. does it always do it?
 Hmm ok im not sure then
 I want to blame compiz bugs
 victorhugo289: That is pretty old. It might be too old for all of unity.
 victorhugo289: you shouold be able to do like a lowquality unity or something
 yea like LjL said..
 victorhugo289: Terminal.. sudo apt-get install unity-2d
 ya?
 victorhugo289: i just checked its in software center too
 i wasent sure if they listed it there
 dynoboyz: Does it exist?
 dynoboyz: seriously though, have you checked for it with gparted or something?
 o ok
 then how is it not recognized?
 dynoboyz: Like.. What is it not recognizing.. Like in nautilus?
 dynoboyz: ... That could have destroyed the partition
 dynoboyz: Your best bet is to attempt data recovery.
 dynoboyz: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery
 dynoboyz: It could get messy. There are also some easier applications in the ubuntu software repos
 praveen: Are they windows computers?
 or linux?
 ok
 praveen: Is samba setup correctly on your pc?
 dynoboyz: you may have lost everything. Hopefully have backups or find professionals to recover it, hard to say how much can be saved from a half edited partition
 praveen: Most likey an issue on the individual windows computer then.. check security settings
 calamari: I feel like ssh has some sort of keepalive
 i'm not an expert on it though lol
 calamari: im pretty sure its controlled by upstart which would explain it
 praveen: It could be an issue on either end..
 calamari: mhm
 praveen: Perhaps an issue w/ the version of windows. Or some random samba issue
 jdl: ... Um Download. Done?
 praveen: ask #samba? lol
 Ok. im done for now..
 later
