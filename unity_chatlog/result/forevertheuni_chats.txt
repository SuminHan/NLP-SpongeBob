 hey I was upgrading to 11.04 and..well there was a problem in the end of installation with nswrapperplugin  so everything stopped before the cleaning etc etc...how can I resume? or what can I do to do it manually?
 so I updated to 11.04...and my gnome doesn't work anymore I have a black screen with stuff running on the back..I tried ubuntu and ubuntu-classic with no effect..I managed to come to kde what can I do? the upgrade failed in the end of installing pkgs and the cleaning didn' take place
 sgaap i'll try
 sgaap, nup nothing missing
 sgaap, aye pop-ups notif come and "crash reports" windows
 I have to reboot to come to ini1 cause I think my nvidia module breaks the fbuffer
 hi again well I tried the dpkg-reconf xorg-xserver.and nothing
 I tried ubuntu failsafe mode.same thing black bg when I do alt+f1 I see glimps of the panel
 kde is all that wrks
 ok in kde
 ubuntu failsafe uses composite?
 yes I enabled them in kde
 y in all ubuntu options in gdm
 ubuntu ub classic ub classic no effects ub failsafe
 starting the session in gnome
 no I'm saying none work gnome is screwed
 only kde workds
 yes and then blackscreen popups show if I altf1 I can see glimps of the panel
 cache_surplus, no no comnd line (i didn't try that one..just went to kde..it works)
 cache_surplus, I can't go to gnome everything is black
 mv .gnome?
 no I have gdm running that starts kde
 but both installed
 I was running gnome when stupid upgrade failed
 been there done that before :( if it's user related I can start another user
 ok I just mv .gconf to .gconfold ;)
 like what?
 I have my nvidia going fine
 aye I know that
 just another question.   flashplugin64-installer conflicts with flashplugin-nonfree
   adobe-flashplugin:i386 provides flashplugin-nonfree and is present and installed.
 and I dont' have flashplugin installed anymore :s
 I'm stuck
 :S
 need to look at a .deb to have my bearings
 is there anyway to manually dl the upgrade scripts?
 to 11.04?
 lol iconmefisto .it's broken believe me
 iconmefisto, I have none installed
 when I try to install it says a weird msg like if it was installed
 I'll force the install of a deb...usually it works
 tnx
 it's really late can't think straight
 hey mate tnx removing gconf and gconfd solved the ubuntu prob
