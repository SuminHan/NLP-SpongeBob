 bloopletech, I copy what you say and do it another day. Peace. Thanks a lot for working with me.
 ADMINS: think about putting this somewhere in Ubottu or something. I've decided this is a good way to learn more linux. http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/index.html
 question: do I have to upgrade to 10.10 before I can upgrade to natty? (now 10.04)
 arand, thanks
 um, 10.04 - is there more than one kind?
 this one ssfdre38 - You are using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
                 - the Lucid Lynx - released in April 2010 and supported until April 2013.

 oh ssfdre38 that's easy. at what point would I move onto 10.10 ?
 does unity have betterfonts, clearer, sharper?
 KaAtta, 10.04 is too complicated for your girlfriend?

 I'm still asking questions about how to partition my gynormous (1T) hard drive so that I can have 2 different ubuntus. I am also still asking about how to copy files from one ubuntu (one one hard drive) to another. I cant sign in on both and I am stuck.
 bloopletech, escott, unless it will get better on reboot I've configured all there is to configure and it's better on windows. I dont want windows, I want fonts I can see with more ease.
 bloopletech, I am using a CRT.
 bloopletech, I can read it there. here I have to make it bigger. -- I turned it on 2 days ago and it made no differnce.
 I like color I dont want to go back to before the amiga.
 you are dissing me by saying that.
 nevermind.
 oh. ok
 bloopletech, thanks for the help. I'm too tired to remember how to get there now.
 bloopletech, yes all you say is true. I can access them. I cannot copy them because I dont have permission. when I log into the other drive I cannot even see my normal filesystem. I can only see the filesystem I am on and 2 windows partitions and one NTFS partions. (I have 3 drives mounted.)

 re how to play this video: video formats vob bup ifo - this is what I have. what do I do? There are lots of files instead of one AVI file. Normally I like to use VLC
 taglass. I downloaded it from the internet. it's all in a directory. what do I do to play it? thanks
 taglass, do I have to make an iso file out of it. I'm so ignorant.
 rww_, thanks
 rww_, wow I can do the same thing then with the iso file from the dvd I copied -- then destroyed the original so I cant read it. Oh my Ponyo will be saved.
 Yes, a year ago when I asked to understand about partitions. I only found FUD. I really really like this, just found it... http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html  in general overview of the linux system: 3.1.2.2. Partition layout and types
 Trying to understand "df -h" compared to what I see in "computer" in nautilus. I have 3 drives, 1T main drive booted up on-SATA also with 31G Windows partition., 2 IDE drives 10G 20G. GUI shows this. Can only see the subparts of 1T filesystem in df --- thanks

 RAMPKORV, they told me not to install 10.10 last night, to stick with 10.04
 RAMPKORV, Arg! Eek!... I need to figure out how to repartition my drive. I really just need to borrow another drive. Switch, repartion, switch back. Then I can intall Natty on a separate partition.  -- I'm also failing at copying files from one filesystem to another. I dont have permissions on the other - no matter which filesystem I log into.
 Not a sexy problem: When I am on filesystem A I cant copy files from filesystem B (no permissions). When I boot into filesystem B I cant even SEE filesystem A. 10.04

 good morning.. just barely PDT. I've got basic ubuntu understanding problems.
 jester7 Natty is in another channel
 !natty |jester7

 I've been asking this for daze!
 ok jester7 I have been informed.
 Hello, I have stuff on an ubuntu installation on one disk. And I want to copy it to another ubuntu installation on another (my main) disk. I dont care if it is become a second user on my main disc or what. I just want to clear the 10G disk. Now what do I do to get a comrad to assist me. It keeps telling me that I dont have permission. I can log into either disk.
 botcity belinrahs does that help?
 TheHackOps, I need context. for the...
 belinrahs I was mistaken. I had the wrong context in my mind for your comment to me which was actually about my assertion that natty was not in this challel so please forgive me and be amused and my runon... :)
 TheHackOps, later thanks
 botcity, yes I can. I still want to fix the issue. I'll take it to "ubuntuforums" and use the "good old american bailing wire" trick that you suggest. :P
 Repeat(I got interrupted)I cant copy files from disk A to disk B (got no permissions it says)  Neither one is encrypted. When I am on drive A (the installation I use all the time 1T, new) I can see drive B and look at things but I cant copy files because I dont have permission. But I can edit a file and resave it on that disk. (botcity are you still interested in this question?)
 botcity. yes. that was automatic. I didnt have to do anything. Remember I said that I can boot on A, read a file on B, open it, edit it, save it. Thus B is mounted.
 Asdfg_, yes, but if you BOOT from WUBI you cannot use Windows. If you BOOT from Windows, you cannot use WUBI.
 botcity I'm a bit unclear but I can try: 10.04,gnome. B is a 9.8G filesystem. It's not 10.04 but it's something earlier. I think. Can I tell without booting into it?
 how can I tell what ubuntu is on a disk without booting into it. where do I look? I can read the disk.
 botcity, I dont know how to copy files from that drive to this drive. I dont have permissions. I know the password to both drives. I would do it in terminal if I knew how to copy cirectories and subdirectories. I dont think the cp command works for that, does it?  Then could I use sudo? That doesnt make sense because root on A wouldnt have permissions on B. Of course I know the password to B, it's mine and I can boot from it. (I must l
 augh right, heh. This is such a tangle of nothing.)
 truepurple I appreaciate your pose
 truepurple I appreciate your prose
 why dont you try to tell me how to repartion my drive .. I need to squeeze stuff together so I can repartition. Like defrag. But I dont know how. I have used ONLY 15% of 884G
 botcity. I dont have permission. that's what it tells me when I do that. I have done that already.
 botcity, how come you dont believe me?
 TiagoTiago, that's a question? what are you using, a laptop?  What is a virgin media?
 botcity, what can I do to copy the files or move the user to my A drive.
 TiagoTiago, call what? you mean a brand new optical disk?
 TiagoTiago, cool. Did you get a new desktop?
 I have 2 Ubuntu installations on different drives, what can I do to copy the files or move the user to my A drive.
 zvacet, how much can I shrink it and not destroy any files. I read that ext4 spreads files out on the HD, unlike NTFS
 zvacet, OK. I didnt know that. I keep learning stuff late. I started on a learning about linux website this week. -- I have another question if you would be so kind. (separate line)
 zvacet - I have 2 Ubuntu installations on different drives, what can I do to copy the files or move the user on the other to my main drive I have booted up on?  Thanks and thanks.
 zvacet, OK I understand what you have told me to do so I will go do it today.
 zvacet, did you get my second question (that I have been asking for days here, lol)
 zvacet - I have 2 Ubuntu installations on different drives, what can I do to copy the files or move the user on the other to my main drive I have booted up on?
 zvacet, thanks
 guest23133 (what a headache to type) is there much difference between modems? as long as you dont get a winmodem.
 I'm staying with 10.04 and it works. HAHA
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-vHrS4s14Q  Feels good to admit it.
 hi! how do I get tibetan letters? I get chinese, etc but squares for tibetan
 compubomb not yet - unless you do it in a separate partition OR have "too much time on your hands" and want to learn and fuss.

 I dont know about windows zenlunatic - I am reading http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1192750 but that's 2 years ago. Also I've got seamless chinese and hebrew (never did anything) so I am expecting that it is not really hard.
 zenlunatic, I dont know anything about tibetan text in windows (correction of my sentence)
 re languages, I went into languages. it told me language support is not installed completely. I chose to install it. (this is ubuntu 10.04) will report what happens... zenlunatic
 ubuntu help did not help me. how do I see the print queue. is there an icon for it. I ended up with two copies.
 languages is NOT it for getting text fonts.
 Idleone, can I make some kind of shortcut to that. (In windoze for instance it appears in the taskbar drawer when you have something in it. I think.)
 idleone I've forgotten that at least twice before.
 Progress towards "seeing" Tibetan characters. I googled differently and ... http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=1829c03d30fa52bf&hl=en
 now that I have a font where do I put it for it to be "installed"?
 Howto Install FONT? now that I have a font where do I put it for it to be "installed"? Help wont load what I choose. goes to arrow curosr to show it's done. Then click choice again and help vanished. Ubuntu fail. (did it twice)
 HowTo Install a font -- https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts -- dhu.. double click on the extracted font file.
 10.04 upgrade has improved my resolution. maybe nvidia forgot to tell me I needed to reboot to see the wonderful changes I made. Better.
 what did the 10.04 upgrade do for me? anybody know?  (if you arent "locked" onto natty)
 oops, my computer cant see my phone. it could before the upgrade. wassup. java phone
 I have XP. How else would I run photoshop if I wanted to, or skype with my webcam, or deal with an antivirus program, or compare font-goodness, or use a version of Picasa that works.  (but I havent been there in months)
 friends: I did stuff in the kitchen and ...my computer was off. what could have happened. everything was still plugged in.
 chrome said it had a strange shutdown and I could restore all the windows.
 FHtrain, I dont think you can get to wubi at all unless you boot from it.
 FHtrain, tell me if it's different.
 crack888 suggestion: prepare a whole sentence with your problem and what Ubuntu you are running and he basic information. We are not mind-readers.
 really. FHtrain if you are using GUI then go to view and choose see hidden files. If you are in terminal use ls -a
 OK I want to copy a DVD complete to disk. what do you recommend I do.
 FHtrain, use my nick when you come back and I'll notice that in the room.
 FHtrain, it's a wierd idea to tell me that it worked? or that the chat room tag turns blue when my nick is used?
 FHtrain, yw
 FHtrain, I see your confusion. I meant you use my nick in the line and it turns it red. Like you have been doing. nothing special. Good to have all this cleared up. Now I have to find a DVD copying program.
 buhman, I'll look.
 please remind me, what's the command to get all my specs. 10.04
 buhman, I'm installing it but there's something I had. It wasnt uptime... It gave me a long long list of every everything and I'd rather have a short one.
 !ask | Guest66097
 buhman I asked in hardware about my old dell that heats up the room... and how I could tell if some other computer would be less hot. He asked me for my specs.
 thanks buhman got them and pasted them http://paste.ubuntu.com/603134/

 I want to copy a dvd to my hard drive. How do I do that?
 I want to return the original and still be able to play it.
 I know there
 I know there's a better place to say this, maybe later. It's a suggestion for ubuntu. windows has the same problem. - Say there is a "copying" process happening. The only choice is continue (donothing) or abort (cancel). I think that aPAUSE would be helpful. Might just need to use the resources for something else for a while and put the copy on the back-burner. That is all.
 zlZBAN THAT'S Normal
 Here's was my problem: and my question. Yesterday I said, how do I copy a DVD to my hard drive. I want to return the original and also be able to play it here. :: I was told, copy the files. When I looked at it I see --> two folders and no files!? [audio_ts and video_ts) <-- I am getting the copy (method: saw the cd one my desktop. clicked on it. it offered to copy it. Done, err still doing. --- What is on this DVD anyway? Is this norm
 al? Why dont I see files? How does a DVD work anyway? ---> Obviously (I think) a referral to info would be great. THANKS
