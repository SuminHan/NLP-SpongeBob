 Hi guys, am trying to install RALink Wifi USB adapter on Ubuntu 10.04.
 insmod for RT3070 ko file fails with invalid symbol.
 (as well as modprobe)
 the network manager shows that it established a successful wifi connection but am not able to browse. RT2870 drivers load fine.
 what are floodbot1, 2 , 3? :/
 anybody willing to help me with the drivers? :(
