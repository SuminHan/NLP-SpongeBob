 I cannot copy files to my home folder, what is the solution
 PythonPup how do I copy files to my home directory?
 someone please tell me how to copy files to home directory. I cannot paste them
 copying from downloads to home
 PythonPup, how do I copy to home?
 PythonPup, are you sure you gave the right syntax for copying?
 PythonPup, it gave the message: cp: missing destination file operand after `Download/broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2'
 PythonPup, I right clicked the files and asked to copy to home directory. but they were instead copied to home/username.
 PythonPup, is there any other way to  copy these files? I am a new user and I can't understand your commands
 PythonPup, In linux mint i think there was a way to open the home folder as the admin and then copy
 PythonPup, nothing has happened after following the instructions in the page. Let me restart and confirm
