 Greetings, all.
 I have run Ubuntu off a live USB stick on my tablet computer. However, the touch screen behaves erratically - in different ways for different versions, too.
 In version 10.10, no presses are detected by the computer, unless I press with two fingers, at which point the cursor will jump to one of the fingers, but not click.
 In version 11.04, the pointer moves with one finger but still doesn't click. Sometimes it clicks but only on a few controls.
 In both versions, plugging in a mouse didn't work - the mouse merely moves around, with clicks not at all being noticed.
 Is there any software or things available to rectify this situation? Thanks in advance for any answers.
 My touch screen isn't working on my tablet computer (clicks aren't registered) and attaching a mouse I can't click either... any help please?
