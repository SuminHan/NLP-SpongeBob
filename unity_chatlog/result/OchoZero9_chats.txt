 to install the touch screen version of unity do i install ubuntu-desktop or ubuntu-netbook
 i'm on kubuntu btw
 Okay I'll try
 ohsix: i installed ubuntu-desktop. After I restarted I selected ubuntu and all I saw was Icons and a background. Alt F2 didn't even work. Now I'm in ubuntu classic (no effect)

 why wouldn't unity 3d run on my computer? I don't have agraphics card and starcraft II runs perfectly in 3d mode
 I don't have any
 I think it's built in the processor
 Jon4248:  I think it's built in the processor
 So what's the deal with the 3D?
 why it doesnt work for me?
 what utility can i run so it can tell me the specs of my device?
 It should have no problem running 3D . since windows aero works fine, and starcraft II works fine too
 The video is built in the processor on a separate die. Intel HD graphics
 mordof: I'm not getting any desktop performance
 is there a #unity ?
 mordof: sorry about that. I just don't have unity for whatever reason
 how do you get your system information like processor memory graphics?
 thx Surlent777 & Herbs
 it may not be detecting my graphics correctly
 i think i may not have the right driver
 ohsix: I ran /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p and all the test passed fine. it says Unity supported: yes
 say it crashes
 how do you bring it back?
 alt+f2 didn't work
 but ill try both. btw i put a terminal icon on the desktop just in case
 brb
 unity --replace` got it working, but I have to put that in every time.
 I want to like unity, but it's a mission to start it
 Herbs: maybe you are understating the number of steps
 xangua: yes. that's what I was on just a few minutes ago
