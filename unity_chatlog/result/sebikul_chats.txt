 Hi to everyone!. When upgrading to natty today (having already installed all drivers, etc.),  after the plymouth screen disappears , I am left with a screen with the nvidia logo, the PC is locked there,  it doesn't load any further, and I must restart by pressing Alt + Sys + B. I have a video card Nvidia GForce GT220 PCI  and onboard Geforce 6150 LE, but not being used. The only thing I could get from the logs is this  (http://paste.ubuntu.
 Note that this only happens when using the proprietary driver. When using nouveau I can use ubuntu without a problem, same as when using a failsafe boot
