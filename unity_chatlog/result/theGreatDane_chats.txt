 they say
 security through obscruity doesnt work
 but
 i change ssh port to random high port and attacks on my ssh went from 30 a day to ZERO
 zero
 yep
 i doubt i'll ever have an attack again
 no1 bothers to scan high ports
 yea but they've no reason to be determined
 plenty of servers out there with ssh on 22
 and all these script kiddies, only try to get in by ssh
 i have fail2ban
 didnt hear about that
 well my server isn't running httpd
 its only running openvpn
 so actually the iptables only allows 2 ports to be open, one for ssh and one for openvpn
 locked down better than fort knox
 any idea what /var/log/lastlog is for?
 thanks
 im using aide, and i set it to notify me about 'atime' changes, however it appears that opening a file doesn't change the atime
 if i open a file over winscp for example
 why install over windows 7? windows 7 rocks
 its very good and stable
 any1 know what xinetd is?
 its a process running on my box\
 ty
 im setting up key based ssh login
 what permissions should i use on the dir 'authorised_keys'
 ?
 im confused about ssh with key... i generated a public and private key, google says put the publc key in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys... BUT, where do i put the private key?
