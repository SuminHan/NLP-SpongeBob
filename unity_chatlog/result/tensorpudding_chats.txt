 computer name is called hostname, it works the same way
 codex84: you can enable file sharing on ubuntu
 codex84: the easy way is to find the folder you want to share, right click and go to Sharing Options, then allow users to create files there. then on windows, look for the computer in your neighborhood
 codex84: this requires your windows xp machine, and your ubuntu machine, to be on the same LAN
 codex84: do you understand?

 natty isn't out yet
 i don't know, is the announcement actually scheduled at a particular time?
 cordoval_: why does it need to be reinstalled
 missed?
 reinstalling won't change any configuration you might have made
 this is by design
 where does unity keep it's config?
 meh
 are you really going to wait until the announcement before you stop telling people to join #ubuntu+1?
 that won't change tomorrow
 madhu: domain names are bought, you need to find a registrar and pay them money
 at repeated intervals
 it's like renting a storage unit
 and the domain name you want has to not actually be used
 already
 madhu: there's lots of documents out there for BIND 9 and djbdns
 madhu: which are the most popular DNS servers
 well, most popular Linux ones, I'm sure the Microsoft one is terribly popular
 hmm, Microsoft's DNS server is a fork of BIND
 Shoogy: configure remote desktop sharing
 Shoogy: open Remote Desktop Preferences, and allow people to connect remotely
 Shoogy: then on the Windows computer, install a VNC client like UltraVNC or TightVNC, and specify to connect to the Ubuntu machine by hostname, on display :0
 Shoogy: this is the easiest way, but for many reasons, running VNC services on a server that is open outside of the LAN is a bad idea due to security risks
 Shoogy: you said this was for a LAN, right?
 Shoogy: is your machine public-routable?
 BajK: what exactly is it you want for a "standard api"
 BajK: i'm pretty sure that the Resolution thing works with any driver you want
 if you put icons in /usr/local/share/icons, will the system be able to find them?
 what else do you have to do to make it work?
 i just noticed that my unity file lens says my home directory is devoid of files, which is quite incorrect
 emet: install ccsm, configure the unity plugin
 ball: what you want sounds like a virtual machine
 ball: you can
 ball: though the chips with virtualization extensions allow you to get decent performance
 ball: you'll need to make a bootable external medium them
 ball: you can't mess with the hard disk while you're in ubuntu
 ball: not necessarily, you can make flash drives into bootable media
 ball: well, sorry then
 ball: the only other option would be PXE boot but that's not only a pain to install, but probably not supported from your hardware
 htcrwn148: it'll have everything you added except programs, for the most part
 htcrwn148: wine programs are installed under the user's directory
 htcrwn148: everything under the user's home directory is backed up, including the wine programs
 htcrwn148: unless your backup software has explicit exceptions
 ThomasUK: no
 ThomasUK: what you must do, when you get to the partitioning step, is find your /home partition and tell the installer to NOT format it, and to mount it at /home
 romno0x: search for openssh-server in the software center, when installed it will be started automatically, and you're good to go
 jonii2: blindingly white? it should look the same as always
 jonii2: just search for it under the applications dash
 romno0x: X11 forwarding means that if you start an X11 application inside the remote shell, the display is forwarded to your host, so you can use those applications remotely
 jonii2: can we see a screenshot of what's wrong
 no
 oh, that's what i got for a moment
 jonii2: that happened to me randomly, i changed the theme back and logged out and logged back in and it looked fine
 jonii2: also how did you get the launcher on the right?
 !arabic | azoz
 jonii2: you can't move windows by title bar?
 jonii2: can you move it by holding Alt and dragging?
 bluefoxicy: were you using compiz before?
 bluefoxicy: well, unity still uses compiz, so i guess it's a bit freaky that it forgot
 jonii2: which theme are you using anyway
 jonii2: did alt+dragging not move them?
 jonii2: does the mouse work?
 jonii2: that's really weird
 jonii2: here's a debugging thing, try opening a terminal and doing 'mv ~/.config ~/.config-backup'
 jonii2: then log out and log back in
 what does unity have to do with mac os 6?
 oh damn, that was a bad idea
 i think having jonii move the .config might prevent him from connecting to irc...
 jonii2: sorry
 jonii2: i didn't mention that doing that would restore your configuration to default
 jonii2: but did it solve the issues?
 jonii2: huh
 jonii2: would seem to imply that it's some configuration somewhere else
 jonii2: if you want to keep your old account but wipe out all your configuration, you could obliterate the ~/.config and ~/.local directories
 jonii2: you could go and open the file manager, and show hidden files, they appear under you home directory as .config and .local
 jonii2: unfortunately most gnome themes don't work so well with unity
 jonii2: before you do
 jonii2: forgot to mention you might need to get rid of .gconf
 jonii2: i think that's just shared files, not configuration, so it probably isn't a problem?
 jonii2: but you can wipe it too
 ShiverOnBT4: open console as in a terminal emulator or one of the system consoles?
 jonii2: i guess :)
 jonii2: you'd be less happy if you had a lot of application configuration that you just needed to wipe
 but i mean, you could go and comb through that directory to find the specific ones that's causing the problems, and save the rest, but it's really tedious
 jonii2: that's unfortunate :|
 kk9822: if you don't really care, choose the 32-bit one
 MadRobot: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/natty/what
 MadRobot: http://omgubuntu.co.uk/natty/ rather
 MadRobot: you need to configure compiz
 MadRobot: install the Compiz Config Settings Manager, and check out the General Options -> Desktop Size
 Senix: if you double-click it, it should run
 manOwl: it's not hard
 manOwl: search for it, then drag it onto the launcher
 you can drag .desktop files too i think
 Senix: generally speaking, files ending in .run are executable scripts (make sure that it's marked executable)
 Senix: you can do this by right-clicking and going to properties
 manOwl: there's a video somewhere on http://omgubuntu.co.uk/natty/ that shows how to do it
 yeah, that's an issue unfortunately
 manOwl: which ones?
 manOwl: that kind of defeats the purpose
 MrTolkinghorn: you should isolate what is causing it to crash, first
 MrTolkinghorn: is it a kernel panic?
 a kernel panic would put a big dump on the screen and wait for you to reboot the machine
 first you should stop overclocking and see if it still panics
 by default linux isn't configured to dump core
 not sure
 have you read the stacktrace that comes up during the panic?
 you can get core dumps by installing linux-crashdump
 and configuring grub i think
 MrTolkinghorn: have you checked /var/log/dmesg
 MrTolkinghorn: and /var/log/kern.log
 but you're sure it was due to a panic?
 chrome_: it's already available in 11.04
 MrTolkinghorn: i guess that sounds like a panic, but every panic that i've had, when it happens, it switches to the console and dumps a stacktrace
 victorhugo289: what card is it
 victorhugo289: even if it doesn't require proprietary drivers, it's not unreasonable for it to be able to run compiz
 victorhugo289: what driver are you using, do you know?
 victorhugo289: the radeon driver has 3d support, so in theory compiz should work with your card

 CoinOp: what do you mean by "cannot get past this"
 does the shutdown halt then
 CoinOp: try rebooting, does it do it again?
 CoinOp: not sure then
 you installed it in vmware?
 i'm running lintian on a package, and it's giving me "section-is-dh_make-template", but i don't know what it means and it doesn't seem to exist in lintian's documentation
 if you're making a package, and you put icons in hicolor, is adding hicolor-theme to the dependencies enough to make sure that installing it does the right thing?
 kernul: yes, check out the power settings
 kernul: what?
 kernul: you want video to keep going to the screen when you've closed the lid?
 kernul: oh
 that's not supposed to happen, i don't think
 kernul: could be a bug then
 fizyplankton: edit the /etc/init/gdm.conf and comment out the lines beginning with "start on"
 fizyplankton: doing service stop will stop it this time, but won't prevent it from running in the future
 fizyplankton: actually, i might be better to change the "stop on runlevel [016]" line to "stop on runlevel [0126]"
 fizyplankton: just prevent it from running on that runlevel
 fizyplankton: it's a bit of an annoying mix of system v and upstart
 fizyplankton: you don't really need to know about runlevels, but they are different configurations for the init program, which chooses what to start at boot
 fizyplankton: ubuntu uses upstart, which replaces (to an extent) the old way of doing things involving runlevels, but it still have runlevels, it's just that people don't really mess with them anymore
 fizyplankton: one corresponds to a single-user mode, one to shutdown, and runlevel 2 is the one for normal activity in ubuntu
 fizyplankton: there's others that can be defined but nobody uses them
 fizyplankton: adding the 2 in that line just means that the gdm isn't run on runlevel 2, which is the default runlevel for multi-user, graphical mode
 i can't say it's worthwhile learning vi just to edit config files as an ubuntu user
 pre-emptively avoid flamewars
 ugh, too late
 Paolo_CT: try starting libreoffice from the terminal, and see if doing Control+c will kill the process
 arch talk goes elsewhere, this is an ubuntu support channel
 vorlov: you might consider the apache channel
 trevorpace: it's under Screensaver iirc
 trevorpace: err, wait, power management
 eje211: does ubuntu classic work?
 w30: not in there
 w30: is this instead of, or in addition to, unity?
 w30: err, ubuntu
 eje211: don't suppose you installed gnome 3 from a ppa or anything?
 flodine: i used to get that bug once in a while
 flodine: does the windows key still bring up the launcher?
 eje211: it could be a bad mixing with kde and unity, but i doubt it
 eje211: maybe /var/log/dmesg
 eje211: if it's a problem with drivers
 eje211: i don't know then, it's not likely to have been logged in another log
 magn3ts: given that it requires different versions of important libraries to be installed, you probably can't do it
 eje211: i think that's related to nfs?
 eje211: don't know why that would cause your problem
 mtelesha: what's gmd?
 mtelesha: is this on ubuntu or ubuntu classic session?
 mtelesha: oh, gdm
 mtelesha: it doesn't show up?
 dios_mio: watch the language, also take it elsewhere
 it's possible that it won't load in the default installer session
 nvidia should work with unity fine if you have a modern card
 Guest71831: you'll have to check the version of mono that is included, and see if it supports .NET 4
 xsinick: a bunch of desktop files are put in /usr/share/applications, just copy them to your desktop
 xsinick: did you not read the message i sent you
 xsinick: all the launchers that the launcher/menu/applications things use are in /usr/share/applications, choose which ones you want and copy them into the desktop
 xsinick: make sure you're copying them; the default is move, which won't work because you don't have permission to delete files from taht directory
 !best | MethedMan
 MethedMan: Evolution is the one that is included, you should try it first
 MethedMan: i liked claws-mail, but i use evolution now and am happy with it
