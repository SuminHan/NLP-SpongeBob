 ohai
 my netbook won't run unity
 it complains about missing 3d drivers/hardware
 is there any way I can force it?
 well, not missing
 crappy
 that's a point, I am actually missing drivers
 jigynet: Will this have changed between ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04? 10.10 and below has always found all drivers that I need automatically..
 ooh, also, is gnome-3 worth using on 11.04?
 oh
 with that in mind, try it in a VM first?
 is there an IRC channel for unity, or does #ubuntu count?L
 what is the overall stability of unity considered to be?
 hmm
 right
 is using ccsm a bad idea with unity?
 because I appear to have broken it
 somewhat permamently
 ChronicSyncope: What do you mean? ccsm does break unity?
 ok
 In that case, what do I need to use to make simple changes to unity? I want to reduce the transparency in the background of terminal windows.
 I've minimised spotify, and now it appears to be lost

 vademecum: can you hibernate or suspend it?
