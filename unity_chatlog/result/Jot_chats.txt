 Hi! I have experienced very annoying problem. Ubuntu 11.04 does not recognize my monitor. As result, I can't set proper resolution and refresh rate -.- I have tried everything I found on Internet. I'm not gonna give up but it's second day since I have been using new ubuntu and still I can't set basic things.
 I'm not sure
 rcmaehl: I typed your cmd in terminal and now it's spammed with things like -display -help -o etc
 gui one
 yep
 I would copy the text from terminal but it's impossible or I'm doing something terribly wrong
 rcmaehl: I typed 00 instead of ---
 now it says it failed to get size of gamma
 is current unity still in beta? or is it intentional I can't type anything in firefox while running chatzilla? -.-
 does anyone know the secrets of setting resolution and refresh rate in new ubuntu? :X
 spungo: +1
 FoolsRun: that you can't set proper resolution and refresh rate for your monitor
 FoolsRun: maybe because ubuntu recognizes your monitor
