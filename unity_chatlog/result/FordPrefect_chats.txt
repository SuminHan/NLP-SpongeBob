 Hello?
 Anyone here?
 Furai sorry there was a lag when I came in here and nothing was showing up.
 Does call system("mkdir directoryname") create a new directory in GVim?
 Anyone here have any Gvim experience?
 I am trying to make a new directory but when I name it , it tells me "Unable to make directory". anyclues botcity?
 I'm new to Gvim and Ubuntu obviously.
 No one knows why I'm getting the "Unable to create directory" response in Vim?
 I need help  with creating a directory.
 "mkdir ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/" returns cannot create directory no such file or directory exists.
 What is going on?
 Anyone have any clues?
 I checked if it exists. It doesn't. I'll try and do it as root
