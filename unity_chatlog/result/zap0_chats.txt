 usr13, thank you.
 can i get some help upgrading?
 Incarus6, the local mirror has 4 packages missing (404).  how do i make this upgrade/update manager use a different mirror?
 knick, where do i get a list of alternate mirrors?
 is there a UI way to change the data in  /etc/apt/source.list
 Incarus6, i didn't mean a text editor.
