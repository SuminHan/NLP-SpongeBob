 Hey, I am having trouble with defective packages
 how can I repair defective packages?
 jrib: So far I am only getting messages that I have to repair them
 not really which ones... and apt-get -f install doesn't work either
 jrib, synaptic and apt-get
 jrib: I only have the German version, but roughly: aborting due to problems in pkgProblemResolver::Resolve
 jrib, not really
 jrib, hm it's about python packages... wait a moment

 is flash really supposed to work fine on ubuntu?
 I'm always getting like 100% cpu usage from literally  nothing
 jrib, I have no idea

 jrib, I have a few ppas...
 jrib: downgrading would basically deinstall most of the software I use, like firefox and gimp
 jrib: hm... another stupid question, I tried to do that with synaptic but I can't actually perform the action because it says I have to repair defective packages
 zvacet, won't work
 but I think I found a way now
 zvacet, thanks
 I am having trouble with the unity interface... before upgrading I was able to use the Empathy chat client
 now my accounts don't connect and I can't find any way to change my accounts
 Also, how am I supposed to find settings in unity anyway??
 ah ok sorry
 yes
 thank you
 at the moment the interface freaks me out because all the panels are missing
