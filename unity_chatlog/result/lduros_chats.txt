 hello, my boot gets stuck after "checking batteries", and if i log in through the command line, I cannot start x manually (sudo startx or sudo gdm) I get fatal server error: no screens found
 any idea what i can do? It's an old desktop and upgrade d to 11.04
 there's a problem with the video card it seems, misconfiguration maybe?
 hello, it seems i can't use unity, and it's using the auto-logging, is there a way I could revert to gnome classic from the command line? I suspect there's a configuration file for this no?
 spikebike: I don't have the gdm-login, because it's logging in automatically
 it makes i'm stuck in the command line, no x-server
 escott: let me try this thanks
 spikebike: i'll try making a second user if the custom.conf doesn't work
 escott: It doesn't seem to have done the trick though, x-server still finds no screen
 escott: I'm wondering if there's a config file for this that's preventing me to get the graphic interface
 rahduke: exactly the same problem for me. if i try sudo startx, i get fatal error: no screens found. do you have the same problem?
 canthus13 codex84: i have the same problem, if i try sudo startx I get no screens found
 canthus13 codex84: i was able to load in failsafe mode, then low graphics, it was ubuntu classic, reverted to ubuntu classic but it didn't do the trick. ... damn
 canthus13: i'm just stuck in the terminal forever :-)
 canthus13: yeh except this computer is my wife's and she doesn't do command line
 :-)
