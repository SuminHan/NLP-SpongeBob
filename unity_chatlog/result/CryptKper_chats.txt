 Can someone tell me how to restore the ubuntu software center to its classic look. after my upgrade everything shows up in a single file line.
 Younder, Ubuntu Software Center, unity isnt the issue.
 Younder, please read my entire sentence. IN ubuntu software center, all of the software categories are being displayed in a single line, how do i restore the setting for 'ubuntu software center'
 salomonv, clean install or upgrade?
 salomonv, turn off your nvidia driver, reboot, turn it back on, reboot, should be fine.
 salomonv, good question.
 Does anyone know how to correct software-center from displaying everything in a single column?
