 firefoxjava keeps crashing in my xubuntu/wubi install??
 i believe so
 =/
 ok i'll update
 any issues with updateing wubi 10.10 to 11?
 vampire..what?
 !wubi 11.04
 !bug list
 lol
 whoops
 sorry about that
 local host is your ip..
 if you change the local host ip it would mess up some things
 vampire, you can't connect to your pc through the same device already used..
 vampire have you tried connecting via another pc on the same network same os?
 another way to connect to the pc you are currently useing, is to use another wifi adapter to connect to an ethernet device on the same network or another wifi device that is free, on that pc
 but what exactly are you trying to do, remote connect?
 why kaushal?
 what dos the white writeing say?
 kaushal please ask your questions here..or specific channels for specific os's like xubuntu etc have their own channels, but this one covers all issues with ubuntu regardless
 particularly support issues
 So, please fel free to include more details on your networking issues
 vampire, what exactly are you trying to do?
 aka are u sure it has a hd??freedos can be run from cmos??
 or a flash drive..
 lol
 a flash drive is often a usb device that uses ddr solid state technology to store data
 a game is not seeing your local host i[p?
 lucas have you tried to restore it with recovery mode?
 vampire do u have a fw?
 well, if you dont know how, then there is alot there you wont know.. are you familiar with sudo apt-get dpkg-reconfigure unity?
 ye that
 what kezz said
 lucas kez
 s command lines would be similar to your issue as well
 aka change it back..
 hmm
 i need to update brb
 hey
 how rude hxing
 !samsung
 what?
 lols
 i used to run a dial up bbs
 i had all kinds of text games
 i kinda want to start a new dial up bbs
 yes 11 is still crashing java
 lol no i have no clue about any text games these days, i'm all 3d rpg fps now
 i need a new pc tho =c
 So, how do i get java to stop crashing? what is known to cause this in 10 and 11?
 also, to circumvent this firefox java,ubu11 bug.. what other browser could i use
 dang firefox is slow..
 3rd problem i'm having.. i can't switch and use diffrent desktops in my xubuntu install..if i select others the menu bars dont show up
 4th issue.. how do i go about setting up a ntfs swap for ubuntu without takeing out the boot secotr
 so we are stuck with an unsupported gui...
 thats wonderful!! way to go ubuntu!
 is there a wubi channel?
 =/
 i attempted to make a ntfsswap in windows, but linux doesnt have access to it, not even listed in gpart
 says there are 3 partitions blocked or secured..
 tommy it sounds like a chipset may need to be installed or re-installed what does lspci report
 and pls try to keep as much details on one line pls.
 tommy yup drivers wont be installed if hw is not detected..with some integrated gfx if not dont in step...will not install properly
 done
 tommy i believe your hardware is supported
 hmm..
 11 is quite new
 ? when does 11 expire? how supported is itt? i know it's quite a work of art!?
 arrrghhh, yes
 zvacet, sweet
 lol, i'm d/ling seamonkey at 1kbps hmm  must be busy...
 lol
 !unity > tommy
 hehe, i'm such a noob
