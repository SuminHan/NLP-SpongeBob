 Hello, folks.
 Hello, I was wondering if any of you would give me your opinion on how well Ubuntu would work on a G4 800mhz iMac?
 Also, I am trying to find the download image for the PPC version but the only link I have found was in the Daily Builds section.
 Damn.
 The only PPC version I found is  http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/
 So would it be best just to install 10.4?
 What do you think stefg?
