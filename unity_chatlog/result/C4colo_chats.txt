 is 9.10 out of support for updates and patches?
 yea, I was on 9.4 before I upgraded in the hopes https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/metacity/+bug/516049 was fixed
 or actually 8.4 originally
 have upgraded this far and no luck, so I'm not very confident the bug doesn't exist in 10.x versions
 tanath, what is the lightest one?
 I DONT want pretty at the expense of performance
 I need a stable platform to use terminal windows and browser windows, supports multiple monitors and virtual desktops
 metacity is not
 ok, thank you
 some have reported that pulling down the most current version of metacity and compiling it worked to fix the problem ... how often would metacity be pulled into the source?
 (I have been dealing with this issue for at least a year hoping every time I click "Install Updates" that it would be fixed)
 ok, thanks guys, I'm off
