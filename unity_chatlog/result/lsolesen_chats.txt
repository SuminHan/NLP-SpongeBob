 Upgraded to 11.04, but only have a black screen.
 How can I solve this?
 Black screens on update seems to be quite common :(
 roasted: I upgraded via update-manager
 to 11.04
 Yep!
 roasted: yep, sorry about the wrong word. Just thought Ubuntu would cut it :/ I have upgraded from 9.04 - 9.10 - 10.04 - 10.10 without any issues.
 But obviously not this time.
 roasted: how do I boot just to the command line?
 Probably soething about gnome / unity or something?
 chaospsychex: that is better than my completely blank login screen except the mouse cursor :)
