 Is 11.04 the stable version or only beta??
 alright
 thanks
 W43372: Yes you are
 I upgraded yesterday, and now my desktop is saying the following: "Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported. For the first word, TAB lists possible command completions. Anywhere else TAB lists possible device or file completions."
 Can anyone help me?
 I did already....:

 I'm having trouble with 11.04. I start up my desktop, and it goes to this grub> thing. It says to hit TAB to show commands and stuff...how do I fix this? someone please help!
 nit-wit: Sorry, I am not very good with the grub stuff.. so like, run "prompt for grub2"?
 nit-wit: ok.
 nit-wit: oh alright I see... on the "linux /boot/vmlinuz<tab> nothing comes up
 nit-wit: its saying no such partition
 nit-wit: its saying no such partition
 How do I find out which partition has the OS on it?
 Well, i mean, I'm on the grub thing, and the link that nit-wit gave me, says X for partition #... I don't know how to find that out on the grub
 nit-wit: Ok so the # is 0?
 nit-wit: alright.. good thing I remember it, its sda1
 :P
 nit-wit: sweet, that worked.. alright, which file now?
 nit-wit: yes, I upgraded, then clicked restart on the thing when it finished, and came upon this problem. I did all that stuff, now its doing like a bunch of info stuff or w/e
 nit-wit: thats the thing, I don't have access to the command line.. but I remembered, it is sda1, and I did that, and then all the kernels popped up
 nit-wit: I picked the 38 one, the highest number of all of em, so that should work
 nit-wit: when I did tab, there was like 5 others, there was 22, 23, and a few more I don't remember
 nit-wit: yes, thats what I did.. I did this exactly: linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.38-8-generic root=/dev/sda1
 nit-wit: Yes
 nit-wit: I did tab, which showed: linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.3<STOP> then I looked at the list, saw the latest one, which is 2.6.38-8-generic, typed 8, hit tab, and it showed up
 nit-wit: alright, I did all that stuff... it did a disk check, but now a black screen? 천.천
 nit-wit: no, I just bought this desktop a few months ago... so yeah
 nit-wit: should I shut it off (hold power button) and start it up again?
 nit-wit: no need, I just shut it off, started it up, and it is working now. Thanks!! :)
 nit-wit: One thing I did notice tho, xchat is a little laggy? 천.천
 Now that I upgraded, my desktop is lagging on minecraft. Why? I don't like this.
 Kibo: So, is it at the place where it shows grub> ?
 KNUBBIG: same for me atm
 Kibo: Ahh okay, I see what you mean now.
 Kibo: hmm, I'm not sure... I never had that problem, so yeah :/ today, I had a different problem where grub2 wouldn't recognize my kernel :/
 Kibo: Alright lol
 Alrightiz :P
 stravant: You can change it by searching in Unity, "Appearance"
 ohsix: teamviewer

 ohsix: I was just suggesting something, no biggie
 Kibo: yeah it must be, so when that finishes it should work :)

 torchie: did you do metacity --replace?
 torchie: oh alright... hmm try restarting gdm, sudo service gdm restart    that should fix it
 torchie: do it in the terminal... sudo service gdm restart
 Hm, ever since I upgraded to 11.04, I play Minecraft, and now java is only using one core? I have a quad-core.. how do I make it even out? :/
 yeah I recommend backing it up :P
 I tried that before and lost everything :/
 kkal: It takes me the same time and I have a quad-core. So its normal
 preyas_: In Appearance

 Is there any widgets in 11.04 for like the weather?
 Dr_Willis: alright, thanks :P
 Since the 11.04 upgrade, my desktop lags on minecraft. Why is it doing this?
 I just got back from going to town, and now my monitor is saying "No signal out in range" something like that... I can't see a thing, so I can't fix it via the gdm.. but I'm in the terminal now, is there anyway to fix this?! 11.04
 quuxman: doesn't do crap, I tried
 if I can see the terminal on the monitor, just not the login screen
 theres something wrong there
 this is bs... ok, so I can go lower then what I had, but then it looks like crap, and says the same thing again... I'm on vnc atm
 I want my normal screen ffs!
 Now that I upgraded to ubuntu 11.04, it FRIED my monitor, what am I supposed to do about this? >:|

 coz_: oh yeah totally, how about you buy me one? not my fault 11.04 FRIED my monitor! I'm ticked
 it was a brand new monitor, just got it over the time of the return date so yup >.>
 Cheese: new drivers = fry my monitor
 yes it did
 nope
 it was 60Hz
 idk, i can't see it?
 linux_is_my_hero: yes I tried that
 didn't work because they say that Linux did it
 on my laptop atm, that has ubuntu
 I'm switching over to pclinuxos gnome version
 linux_is_my_hero: I tried that, I said it about 100 times to ESALATE the call, but hp is so damn stubburn >.>
 escalate*
 unity sucks anyway, thats why I'm changing.. one more thing I guess I'm gonna try is to install windows (blek!!) and see if that works.. if that doesn't, I'm gonna call them back
 so bbl.
 linux_is_my_hero: still don't work, tried it on my laptop and everything, still don't work so its the monitor not my comp
 and before 11.04 does anymore damage to my comp, I'm changing asap.
