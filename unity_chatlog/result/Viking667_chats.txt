 really quick question about removing a set of packages at once - I put package names into a file with lines like "package   purge", and now I'm trying to get dpkg to remove all of those package names. What command should I be telling dpkg to use?
 I tried "cat removethese | dpkg --set-selections" but it didn't seem to do anything, and returned in a couple of seconds.
 LAcan: should be okay.
 LAcan: that, I can't tell you, because I don't know.
 bah. Not enough room...
 ... weird. I'm noticing "artifacts" while running Unity.
 I'm using ATI, not Nvidia...
 Oh, that reminds me. What am I meant to get when I start 11.04 (after upgrading)? I've just installed the unity packages (and all the other stuff it wanted)
 ... when I log in, I get nautilus, various services started, but no gnome-panels.
 Well, I'm not sure. I don't know what the "default" unity desktop looks like
 hrm.
 let's try this then...
 ........... oooooo heck.
 ATI HD3450
 ciccioba: do you have pulseaudio started?
 hm. Can't help there then, I'm having my own uh, issues with pulseaudio.
 ah.... in a terminal, type "ps ax | grep pulseaudio
 gah. Now I have some issues... I'll be right back.
 sorry about that - was getting some major dissasociation...
 Unity's certainly not something I've ever come across...and boy is it different in some ways.
 don't worry about it (r620) - I think I've got it going now. my only real problem is: I can't seem to interact with the panels now, except to click their icons. I used to be able to have them hide themselves, now that isn't showing ... in fact, right-click on the panel doesn't do anything.
 I've got 2Gb (plus a bit) of swap to go along with my 2Gb of memory.
 one of the reasons is so that if I can get away with it, I can use the hibernate function
 so far, that's not actually working for me... I suspect that's because I've got two cores. (Pentium Dual Core)
 eeeeeep .... right. I'm out of here.
 I think I've had enough of Unity... back to it tomorrow.
 I seem to be having trouble with Unity a bit... I can't right-click on any of the panels on either of my monitors... as a result, I can't add indicators or remove them... nor can I figure out how to start them up.
 In addition to that, (another problem) how do I persuade Ubuntu One that I actually _have_ an internet connection even though it swears black and blue I don't?
 hm. Seems that once I install the applet (the deb) and type in its name, then it appears on the panel...
 can't do diddle about the panel though to hide it. The closest I've got is when an app is fully fulscreened.
 Artarian: actually, once I cured the two or three errors I did have, it was good to go.
 ChapterNZ: ahh, sorry. Unity. Click on the startgear thing, huge window pops up with all the applications listed, and a searchbox at the top
 "sometimes"?
 hang on. I'll log out, log in - then I'll see if the indicators load THEN.
 sorry - won't exactly cure the Ubuntu One program's problam.
 lem
 eeek.
 the weather applet didn't appear, and neither did the other applets I installed packages for...
 s/applet/indicator/
 I'll forget about the indicators, but I really want Ubuntu One working, so I can evaluate the silly thing properly...
 Don't tell me I have to have the NetworkManager installed???
 Ubuntu One. Who the heck knows something about that? I badly want it to use the network I've got, and not play silly beggars telling me it can't find one... when I'm typing IRC on it.
 (the network, that is)
 How do I ADD workspaces to the four that exist from the Unity workspace switcher?
 hm. CCSM being ... the compizconfig?
 looking there now...
 THANK you. I was looking in the wrong places.
 now, how do I actually change DESKTOPs, not virtual spaces?
 bromide_bro: and the deb packages expand to bigger than 600Mb when uncompressed
 bromide_bro: what's on the CDROM is a single compressed filesystem, and the contents (usually) gets copied over uncompressed.
 chris_008: err, you can't.
 ... not without a hex editor. And that's not covered by Ubuntu support.
 ah well. Finally got Ubuntu One working, though not without having to kick up a browser first.
 i.e. add libnss3
 You might want libnspr4 in addition
 hmmmm. Could I submit a bug report? Heh...
 When starting up Ubuntu ONE for the first time, it tells me I need an internet connection to use it. Does'nt allow me to click on anpthing else except the website... i.e. I can't click on the "I already have an account" lisk.
 link
 well, I found that if I ran "u1sdtool -c" I could connect... finally...
 now I'm happy. But I think the text is misleading, so's the inability to click on the "I already have an account"
 yeah, you are fl00ding
 anyhow, I'm glad I got Ubuntu One installed, and working... though really, it looks entirely like a clone of DropBox plus syncing of Firefox bookmarks (which firefox already offers, I think) and Evolution contacts
 eiriksvin: hmm? how do you mean?
 rage: titles displayed where?
 ahh, no i don't get that either.
 I get the icon for the application showing on the snapshot window though...
 Oh. I am.
 sorry...
 rage: which application switcher are you using?
 ANd I'm using Unity, I don't get the title of the window.
 ahhhhh. I'm not using static. I can start it up and try that out.
 brb
 ah huh.
 Checked your theme?
 Yup. I can concur that with the "Static application switcher" I don't see titles either.
 ATI card, HD3450
 ... if we're talking about the snapshots
 fisix: why should it?
 oh. Then I apologise. I thought it'd not change because it's wireless, and you'd plugged in a wired link.
 for updates/upgrades, don't run into the problem I ran into a while ago... couldn't upgrade packages because the release was no longer present at any of the Ubuntu mirrors.
