 ahh great :)
 <3 Ubuntu!
 so how is unity compared to docky? Is it a step forward or something different?
 is 11.04 a LTS release?
 I'm happy with python-docky, but I see that the installer say it's no longer needed? https://bit.ly/mvgmQF I can reinstall after upgrade?
 hi, how can I remove that unity bar and get the old menu back? I tried to log in with classic, but didn't get the old menu?
 is there an issue with 3d support in compiz for 11.04? I upgraded to 11.04 but it broke my old desktop.
 ActionParsn: ati with ati catalyst driver
 ActionParsn: ok, thanks for the top
 ActionParsn, you wouldn't know easiest way to uninstall catalyst? Is it thru apt or do I need to run a script?
 nevermind, I found it, seems you can do it in "Aditional Drivers"
 ezrafree: you can do an apt-get remove unity but I would excpect some more work to get things back to normal again
 That Ubuntu Classic login is not true, it didn't work for me
 I had to remove unity as well
 after doing an upgrade, emerald doesn't seem to work and I'm missing window decoration. Any advice on how to add window decoration again?
 it seems to be that compiz has lost all the setting. Is it possible to revert compiz to default settins?
 whats the name of the cool new terminal in 11.04 under Applications > Accessories? the one with screen and nice hardstatus? Stats with a b I think?
 I'm trying to setup desktop-webmail, but when I use "Send by email" it seems like Opera starts instead of Firefox and webmail.
 maybe I don't understand, but isn't desktop-webmail going to give me a new entry under Prefered Applications for mail?
