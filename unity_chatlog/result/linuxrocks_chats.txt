 Hi all, I'm going to upgrade from 10.10 to 11. Has anyone encountered some obvious problems during the upgrade process?
 michaels, which kind of problems?
 michaels, that's not good. What did you do then?
 michaels, which things?
 michaels, thanks, I will postpone the upgrade...
 michaels, yes, this is my "production" machine. Prefer services to be up than running the new, shiny version of Ubuntu
 michales, s/the/than
