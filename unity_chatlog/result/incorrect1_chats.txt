 oh windows don't have any edge resistance in unity
 right now do i go back to a 1x4 virtual desktop arrangement i hate 2x2
 how can i put back normal scroll bars?
 rizzuh, nope
 rizzuh, i was missing some packages
 once you tweak unity its create, my desktop those huge sidebar icons are so fugly unless you shrink them down
 ouss999, probably a good idea
 ouss999, 11.10 should show unity being much more mature
 eigba_, i like the amount of screen real estate i get back
 i like the sidebar now i've tweaked it
 ilon, its on the left hand side
 ilon, all your tasks should be there
 zvacet, do what customise the sidebar?
 ilon, well to me it encompasses all the same functionality, list of apps and their status
 oh wait you can't close them from the sidebar
 my mistake
 ilon, same here
 to customise the sidebar you install the 'compizconfig-settings-manager' then go to the unity settings
 you also want to turn off the 'back light' damn its so ugly with all those colours
 ilon, i agree,
 zvacet, you are using unity 2d?
 i do not know why unity was pushed out so early
 ilon, i bet in a week i will get irritated and go back to gnome2 or find a unity ppa
 my biggest irritation so far is the 2x2 virtual desktop
 i am used to gnome2 1x4 arrangement
 ilon, 11.10 will see it mature
 om26er, i've already done all i want with ccsm
 i love some of the great wm theme designs, i love the fact that someone thought it would be a great idea to but a tab in the bottom right to cover up part of the app
 so useful hiding firebug from me
 ilon, i don't have any milk for my coffee this morning
 how annoying, if skype is docked you click it, it loads another skype
 it doesn't just focus the existing
 reena, suck it and see,
 if you click an icon on the sidebar it should minimise it
 has anyone tried gnome3?
 bazhang, i was wondering how stable it currently is, i've seen the ppa and i know it will trash unity
 bazhang, thanks, i am just starting to find unity too incomplete for my desktop
 i figured i might try gnome3
