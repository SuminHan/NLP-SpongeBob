 johnjaylward: you can use python-appindicator to write one if it is something simple, https://launchpad.net/indicator-sysmonitor is a good reference, only about 100 lines of code
 mikebot: http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.04/MD5SUMS
 corecode: the shadow is configured in the metacity theme such as  /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml in the shadow tags, set them to radius 0 and the shadow is gone, (or just shrink them)...best idea is probably to copy it to ~/.themes/ , change the name and make your edits
 Stava1: yes, in ccsm, under the unity plugin Hide Launcher/Never, you may need to install compizconfig-settings-manager first
 truepurple: if you mean the preview 64bit one here  http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10_square.html you can just unzip it and copy it to ~/.mozilla/plugins and it should work with both chromium and firefox
 truepurple: either using nautilus or if you are in the same directory with it: mkdir -p ~/.mozilla/plugins; cp libflashplayer.so ~/.mozilla/plugins
 truepurple: ctrl+h in nautilus shows hidden directories, and ctrl+L lets you type in paths
 truepurple: yep, ~ is your home directory, so if your username is truepurple, it would expand to /home/truepurple
 truepurple: but ~ is automatically expanded, so you can actually type a ~
 truepurple: yes, exactly, just copy and paste it there
 truepurple: after you extracted it that is, it should be called libflashplugin.so
 truepurple: yes, that is correct
 truepurple: it's okay, it's really flying because 11.04 just came out
 truepurple: better to ask the channel, I don't have any ati cards
 heyguise: zeitgeist keeps track of recently used files for the unity files and folders lens
 heyguise: if you install the gnome-activity-journal and log out/back in you can run it and see what zeitgeist keeps track of
 scorch_: yes, it works fine
 logi01: or: sudo apt-get remove indicator-appmenu; then log out/back in
 Andre_Gondim: in ccsm under general options
 MadRobot: it's in the repos
 !info compizconfig-settings-manager | MadRobot
 MadRobot: although it does appear that simple-ccsm is broken at the moment
 justyellowboy: I believe using Image/Mode/Indexed... then selecting the palette, <= 256 should give you an 8-bit png when you save (imagemagick identify gives me that impression when I check it after saving)
 salomonv: there is an option in the pidgin preferences to show the status icon, however you would need to add it to the whitelist if you are using unity (it will show up in the messaging menu though)
 salomonv: dconf-editor, desktop/unity/panel/systray-whitelist ..probably add 'Pidgin' but I haven't tested it
 salomonv: the description also suggests that adding 'all' will allow everything, which may be another option to try, haven't tested that either though
 salomonv: the changes should be applied as soon as you make them, might need to restart pidgin though
 salomonv: I just tested it here, it works, try restarting unity
 salomonv: Pidgin, this is exactly what I have ['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Mumble', 'Wine', 'Skype', 'hp-systray', 'Pidgin']
 takatori: it will start with the default Ubuntu session if you have drivers that support it (usually)
 Soothsayer: ccsm under the unity plugin, hide launcher/never
 salomonv: np, glad it is working
 Viking667: in ccsm under general options on the desktop tab
 Viking667: yes compizconfig-settings-manager
 Bsims: sudo apt-get remove liboverlay-scrollbar-0.1-0; will disable the overlay scrollbars
 Bsims: and sudo apt-get install overlay-scrollbar; will bring them back
 chaospsyche: dpkg -l 'linux-image*';
 RitchieThai: the Home Folder icon that is by default at the top of the launcher brings up nautilus, if you removed it you can drag it back from /usr/share/applications/
 RitchieThai: is this in 11.04?
 RitchieThai: ahh, alright sorry, I don't know how to do it in that version
 ttist25: it is also in File/Connect to Server when you click the Home Folder launcher (nautilus)
 jbwiv_: in natty, /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default has /var/log/messages commented out, you could add it back if you wanted it (then restart rsyslog)
 nongol: try running: LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 eclipse; you could also uninstall liboverlay-scrollbar-0.1-0 if you wanted them gone everywhere
 jbwiv_: in natty, /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default has /var/log/messages commented out, you could add it back if you wanted it (then restart rsyslog) (repost from above)
 jbwiv_: although it is actually /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf; typo
 jbwiv_: it was mostly a mix of kern.log and syslog, although some messages may be missing, I haven't really checked
 Geoffrey2: echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/drm_kms_helper/parameters/poll; > is captured by the shell and is run as your user, not root
 H1N1: it appears to be a capital X, -lXtst
 josefig: is this on 11.04?
 josefig: echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/mongodb.override; that should do it, it should only start when you run: sudo service mongodb start;
 bull9408: it isn't a gnome-panel, you can't add panel applets, they need to be recoded as indicators to show up there
 bull9408: it's still there in Ubuntu Classic mode
 bull9408: the notification area is still there though, but most apps are blacklisted by default, you need to add apps to the whitelist for them to appear
 sparrW: you can disable launcher hiding in compizconfig-settings-manager under the unity plugin, you probably can't move it easily
 Somelauw: echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq; and you're right, > is captured by the shell
