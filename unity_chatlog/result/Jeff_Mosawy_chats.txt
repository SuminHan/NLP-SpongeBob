 Anyone can tell me how can I solve my wireless problem ?
 Ali, which driver should I install for 1545 Dell Laptop ?
 Ali: Yes, I think so.
 Ali_: I'll can install my wireless device there? Are you sure?
 OK. By the way, should I be connected to the internet for install this driver? Because I'm on Windows right now and I don't have internet in Ubuntu because my wireless doesn't work.
 Ali_: Hi again. I did what you said but unfortunately I couldn't get the driver. Becuase it need an internet and I don't have.
