 hey, my terminal currently looks like this http://imagebin.org/151658
 and ideas how to revert this?
 I have no idea how that happened, I just turned on the pc and it looked like this :(
 I tried rebooting but it didn't help either
 usr13: it's urxct
 usr13: actually it's  "urxvt +tr -tint black -sh 25 -tn rxvt-unicode"
