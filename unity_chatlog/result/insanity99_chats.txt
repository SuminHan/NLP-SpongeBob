 hey guys, i am liking ubuntu 11.04 right now, but i dont like that i cant see what programs i have open, like normally on the bottom all your programs are there
 hey guys, is there a way to have the bottom bar on 11.04 so i can see my open programs?
 i'd rather uity, but be able to see my open programs
 what are peoples opinions on unity?
 i wasn't liking it at first, then i discovered the keyboard shortcuts, there great, especially if your a vim/emacs user :D
 though i dont like not having all my open programs on the bottom, its harder to access and see your programs
 i just installed indicator-sysmonitor, how do i get it on panel?
