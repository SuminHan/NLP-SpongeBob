 Hi guys.
 Am I at the right place asking technical questions about Ubuntu?
 Nice.
 So, I can't install it. Or I can, but not really. Let me explain.
 The latest Ubuntu seems not to install the boot manager. I have Windows 7 installed, told Ubuntu to install side by side with 7, the installer runs through, at the end where I'm supposed to press Enter to restart, I press enter
 And after the reboot, there's no sign of Ubuntu at all. No boot manager, nothing.
 Did it
 The performance is horrible
 I'd like to go native
 I was also going to wipe Windows if Ubuntu meets my needs
 So I'd like not to use Wubi
 Can I upgrade from that to the latest Ubuntu then?
 Hm. Will try that later.
 What's the downside of upgrading?
