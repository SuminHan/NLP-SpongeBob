 ubuntu+1 is invite only?
 Should I download a .tar.gz version of revenge of the titans, or a .deb version? (Ubuntu 10.10)
 Dr_Willis, ok, doesnt make any difference then?
 does anyone here play revenge of the titans?
 need some help installing it
 FreeTheBee, PM?
 I downloaded the revengeofthetitans .tar.gz from Humblebundle.  When I extract it , and try to run it using ./revenge.sh, nothing happens. Have tried chmod 777 revenge.sh and sudo ./revenge.sh
 I downloaded the .deb file of Revenge of the Titans, installed it using ubuntu software center. Now, when I try too launch it using the software launcher nothing happens. Using Ubuntu 10.10. Any ideas?
 Is there any command that will reset my Ubuntu state to default 10.10? i.e. undo any modifications I made  (Something like doing a system restore to the 1st day of OS install in Windows)
 escott, Can a reinstall be done easily without messing up GRUB? I seem to have broken various things in the system..  have 2 versions of JDK installed somehow(some programs see one, some see the other). apt-get has a habit of hanging,etc..
 escott, yes, its a dual boot setup with Windows 7
 escott, rgr So, I can also download 11.04 , Install it like  I installed 10.04 , and with minimal effort get windows 7 back in GRUB. Right? I should overwrite the old Ubuntu install?
 escott, rgr The 1st time I installed Ubuntu it was automatic.
 should I expect any difference this time since grub is already installed?
 rgr, ohk..  Then, if I use the same Ubuntu 10.04 install I had used earlier, it wouldnt cause any issues because grub already exists?
 ok.. I'll try downloading 11.04, else just reinstall 10.04..  thanks
