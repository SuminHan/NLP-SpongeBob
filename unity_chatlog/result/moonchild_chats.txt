 hey guys
 I have a couple of questions about the new version of ubuntu
 specifically whether it is possible to disable the global menu bar while using the unity UI
 can anyone tell me if its possible, or link me to instructions on how to disable the global menubar piece of unity?
 I actually do want to kick the tires on unity, but *don't* want it to feel more like OSX than widows
 Guest29994: I'd start by telling people everywhere that linux actually runs
 Guest29994: start with something like 'its in your android phone, in your wireless router, yada, yada'
