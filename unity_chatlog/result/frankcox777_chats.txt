 hi everyone
 I cannot get cable working in new install of Ubuntu 10.4 -the same cable works on 9.4
 would someone be kind enough to help me get my cable broadband going in Ubuntu 10.4-it works fine in 9.4
 nothing
 I can connect same cable to this machine and it works fine-
 It is not the signal -the ehernet shows up in lshw
 what else can I tell you? There is nothing wrong with the connection -there is something with the software or hardware
 I can plug the cable into any of my other linux installs and no worries
 I see a light from the ethernet port but it does not appear to light the end of the cable as it does on other machines
 ok
 yes
 ok
 mikinanuq ok
 mikinanuq it gives an ip address
 mikinanuq ok
 mikinanuq - says "network is unreachable"
 mikinanuq thanks for helping
 mikinanuq will try
 mikinanuq -yes
 mikinanuq-both machines have same address
 mikinanuq 127.0.0.1
 mikinanuq-oh-I see it -brb
 mikinanuq-this machine has the 192 address-the other does not
 guest6900 swap is like pagefile in windows-virtual memory
 mikinanuq ok
 mikinanuq 1665 0.0 0.3 3320 800 pts/0 S+ 02:17 0.00 grep --color=auto dhcp  {dhcp  is in red]
 mikinanuq ok
 mikinanuq says to use service networking start
 mikinanuq -applet -  an instance ia already running
 mikinanuq- sorry to be so dense but what would I do to see if network is disabled?
 mikinanuq it says it is enabled on the panel
 mikinanuq   checkmark enable networking
 mikinanuq ok
 mikinanuq auto eth
 mikinanuqnever used
 mikinanuq ok
 mikinanuq connect auto ic checked
 is
 mikinanuq MTU ato
 automatic
 mikinanuq yes
 mikinanuqipv6 is set to ignore
 mikinanuq eth1 only
 mikinanuq ok
 mikinanuq I am beginning to think it is the ethernet card or its driver-maybe I should try to boot the drive in another machine?
 mikinanuq- I see them but not on the cable
 mikinanuq-correction -that was just a reflection-no lights
 mikinanuq-Usually ubuntu finds the drivers if there is a connection-maybe that is my problem here-no connection, no ethernet driver
 mikinanuq -Wont take long to find out
 mikinanuq-have to use this machine-brb
 mikinanuq-apparently you were right- it is working on the other drive but know says eth0
 mikinanuq-any idea how to fix it?
 not sure-on this one it says eth0 instead of eth1
 mikinanuq>	not sure-on this one it says eth0 instead of eth1
 mikinanuq- Wonder if I delete eth1 on other machine and reboot if it will start working?
 mikinanuq-ok - I guess the next move is to put in a pci ethernet card and disconnect the one on the mainboard
 mikinanuq -Thanks for all your time
