 Could anyone help me with .tar.gz extentions?
 ActionParsnip : Managed to extract it, now what? :)
 ActionParsnip : .tar.gz
 ActionParsnip : Oh, didnt think that mattered. ' mupen64plus-bundle-bin-32-1.99.1.tar.gz '
 ActionParsnip :  Nevermind, found out there was an executeable in it. Sorry for wasting your time :p
 ActionParsnip : My bad, overlooked it ;)
