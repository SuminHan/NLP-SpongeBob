 ok the  new 11.04 is shitty
 but thses are so clear
 1. where is the right click on the tool bar?
 well how am I suppose to see all my cpu core  with the cpu scaling applet?
 :(
 Surlent777:  thanks I will try that
 I got dual screens and it seems really screwed up
 double  taskbar time and date widgets
 Herbs:  yes it is
 I'm on it now and it is screwy
 gonna go classic
  see if that work
 works
 I like the side bar icon thing
 can you scale it?
 Surlent777:  thanks
 CAN"T TAKE IT  GONNA REBOOT  TO CLASSIC
 I sure the devs got all these issues  presented to them before hand and it was ignored
 ahhh
 Classic solved all the issues
 Classic is the shiznit
 can I put the fancy side bar on classic
 ?
 well
 it ok
 I don't need preety
 preety I'm just a power user that need solid
 ohsix:  Once devs fix  the Unity issues some more then I'l sitch
 switch*
 ohsix:  I understand
 blender window is opening  wacky
 any body with Dual screens
 and Blender
 ?
 Anyone has  duals screens and Blender in window mode?  I run blender window mode and it streched off screen I have a nvidia geforce card with the plugin running
 in previous  Ubuntu version  it all worked fine
 hmm
 I think compz was on on my past installl
 I feel like to Cuss
 I so wanted this  to work  out of the box
 it's like the one reason I can't recomend ubuntu to any one with a clear mind
 I like the look
  of unity
 but why is there less stuff
 ?
 I had to change to classic mode to get to customize my tool bar
 and to stop it from doubling on  my dual screens
 I'm gonna switch back to unity  and take screen shots of problems
 robin0800:  smartphone generation that will learn later and add that shit back
 why do I have to install the appelet stuff back when the system already have it in classic mode
 >:(
 the problem is that some dev try to make it an apple
 becuase they never used linux before and is accustome to  MAc os
 ubuntu is operating slower
 this is the worst ubuntu ever
 I understand you guys
 I understand but to be honest I smell Mac OS  snobbery on my beloved Unbuntu
 I got to check this out]
 I may be a gnome problem
 I think there needs to be and Ubuntu  12 pronto this is begining to look like a big epic fail for the first time in it's history
 look  you can hide feature  and focus on others make optons for things in the new  interface but don't just throw them away
 why does blender span into the other workspaces  on windowed mode?
 I switch to classic and it's the same nonsense
