 Hey guys I need help!
 I have like three problems that are bugging me bad!
 Ok for some reason Grub was showing up, and then all of a sudden it stopped and goes str8 to ubuntu
 how do i get grub back?\
 Grub stopped working how do I restore it anyone?
 OMG I just bought a Archos 10 the one with Android on it, but I sat on the screen /:
 ANYBODY help me restore grub?
 NO I didn't lose it after installing windows I dont have windows installed yet it just stopped poppin up
 Its installed I tried to install another bootmanager Lilo? over it but it did not work
 I have ubuntu as one big drive
 I couldnt boot into my windows drive so I delelted it
 grub-install just gave me a bunch of options would uninstalling  then reinstalling via ubunto software install work
 If it wasn't for Ubuntu Software Center I think I would install OpenSuSe
 I need to go back to the OLD ubuntu, that why I need GRUB I saw that option, new Ubuntu not allowing me to burn ISO's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 what do i do
 What if it wont let me go back to old version ubuntu, and what if old version doesn't allow me to burn ISO's either for some reason?
 DO you think having the new version of ubuntu is what causing me not able to burn ISO?  should I go back?
 DO you think having the new version of ubuntu is what causing me not able to burn ISO?  should I go back?
 It just say ERROR or something.  I can get it go through simulation but thats it
 It sucks
 I tried 10 different ISO with 10 different DVDS, and brand but it did let me burn a CD once WinXP but I got a blue screen starting up
 Ima shoot myself if I can get windows back
 Can some1 help! This is my biggest prob EVAAaAAAA
 Everytime I go to burn a ISO on DVD it says in K3B "cdrecord has no permission to open this device"  I had same prob with other prog, other dvd, other brands everything.
 To burn a dvd
 how do i do that
 calamari: I will love you forever plz tell me how
 It don't work with brasero either
 I tried that prog, it gives error im not sure if it says anything about not having permission
 I tried that too KM0201
 I never had error until I updated to new ubuntu
 :calamari i'm sorry but I still dont really understand
 I was able to burn a cd ISO but when it comes to DVDS im screwed
 Ok I was under user and groups
 What was I supposed to do there
 And select what under groups
 yes, the cdrom group has my name checked there is not really any more options .. should I uncheck it and check  it again or something
 No Ban
 Shoot Calamari can I use a live cd to boot up then accesss my files and try burning a cd like that
 oh yeah I will need my cd in it .lol
 Wait I think I do have extra cdrom
 No CDR or DVD group
 Calamari Coudl I add a DVD group or do I need Drivers or something
 Calamari I am using anything and everything, I think I have every burning program, but I usually try KB3 or basero
 Can you add DVD to the "admin and group" it ask for a number when I press add
 the cd is under burn:///
  Calamari Permission Denied
