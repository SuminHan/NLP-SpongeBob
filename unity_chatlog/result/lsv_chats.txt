 what does Maverick, Natty, Lucid, Karmic, and Hardy refer to?
 arrrghhh, thanks.  Is there any way of checkin which one I have using the bash?
 *bash
 arrrghh, thank you so much.  You're my new best friend :D
 arrrghhh: OMG! you have become my best friend forever!!
 I also use it, but I didn't know I could use it here.
 ok one more question.  How can I change my start up setting so Ubuntu starts in text mode?
 ActionParsnip: where would I change that?  In grub?
 ActionParsnip: I see... Thanks a bunch!
 ActionParsnip: like this >> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text quiet splash" ?
 ActionParsnip: does changing that line in /etc/default/grub changes how I would log into the windows partition? (a little ashamed of this)
 ActionParsnip: ok, thanks, will reboot after some update finishes.  Thanks again.
 kjxl9: that's normal. Just type the password and press enter
 me bye
 quit
