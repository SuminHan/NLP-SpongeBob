 anyone know how to upgrade chromium on ubuntu 10.10 to chromium 11? I would think there would be a ppa for this and im not sure why the current ppa hasnt been upgraded yet
 vibhav: stable channel ppa?
 Incarus6: but isnt 11 the current stable release?
 Incarus6: what is this, Centos? =P
 Incarus6: yes, i was making a joke about updates
 this probably being asked a lot the past two days, but can we not upgrade to 11.04 until all the PPA's we use upgrade to netty as well?
 there is zero logic to that statement. I really hate spammers
 how can i upgrade to natty without having all of my third party ppa's being updated as well? My update keeps failing because some of them dont have natty repo's
 zvacet: quick way to do that?
 zvacet: how is it that there are repos that i have though that arent in there
 how do i move the unity launcher to my left menu?
 er, left monitor
 No one knows how to move the unity launcher to a different monitor?
 how do i change which monitor is my primary monitor?
 nvm, figured it out. xrandr --output DVI-1 --primary seemed to do it
 btw, where should we go to properly bitch about unity? I mean "give feedback"?
 bazhang: im not wanting to chat, i want to give feedback to the developers so they actually know what their users are thinking
 btw, i highly would not recommend telling people to use gnome 2 (classic) if they dont like unity as it appears the classic mode wont be an option with 11.10. So If people dont like unity, they might as well find a new OS from the looks of it. Im starting to do my hunt now unfortunately
 Incarus6: its really to bad that gnome and ubuntu decided to  make such radical changes. If people wanted something so radically different, they would have chosen a different project. Right now i feel like i was given a "bait n switch"
 Incarus6: most desktops are not used for multimedia, most are used for productivity
 dibs: just untick anything third party
 you dont have to uninstall them
 Incarus6: thats a theme issue imho. You dont decrease productivity to increase "prettyness", EVER.
 ok, this is frustrating. Ever since upgrading to natty, im getting a lot of popup errors when clicking on shortcuts of mine or even some files. Basically it shows the the correct path to the file, but then says: "Cannot display......The location is not a folder". Why the heck is it thinkings its a folder in the beginning?
 tripelb: photoshop cs5 runs pretty decent for me in wine.
 ErezCohen: define "admin"
