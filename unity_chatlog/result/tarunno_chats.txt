 Hello guys
 happy release to all
 I have a question
 I read the Cannonicals official blog earlier
 they said there won't be any netbook version in 11.04
 but I can see a torrent file for 11.04 in Ubuntu site
 why is that?
 ActionParsnip, which two?
 ActionParsnip, in this page it shows a torrent file for downloading "ubuntu-11.04-netbook-i386.iso" http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/alternative-download
 ActionParsnip, which seems like a deadlink
 ActionParsnip, I use the mirror hosted in my country
 ActionParsnip, I download the ISO from mirror and then share that in our local tracker to BitTorrent it ;)
