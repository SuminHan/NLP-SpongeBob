 hi
 i want to migrate the settings of a 10.10's evolution to 11.04
 which folders do i have to place where?
 it seems the folder got moved from .evolution to .confg/evolution ...
 escott: can't change that anymore :-/
 escott: or can i point that "import" to the old .evolution folder?
 escott: but first, how can i get evolution clean again?
 even if i delete .evolution and .config/evolution, it keeps placing the data there
 i have no idea where the files could be
 i deleted the evolution folders, and started evolution and it still had all the settings and mails
 escott: any ideas?
 escott: i had a first attempt t move my mails over
 but then i saw that the folders had changed
 so i want to delete all data evolution currently has and retry, but i can't seem to delete it
 it reminds me of that automatic windows restore feature, where it just kept replacing the files you deleted in the system folder :-)
 and i basically want to start with an clean evolution without any data
 escott: that's what i did
 escott: i closed evo. deleted all the folders (.evolution/.config/evolution), then started it again because i wanted to verify it. but it STILL had all the mails
 and i have no idea why or how evo keeps the mails
