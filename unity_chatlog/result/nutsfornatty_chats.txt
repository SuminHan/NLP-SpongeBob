 centos is a fine server platform
 the only thing wrong with centos is the main branches are not updated nearly as frequently as they should be
 but as long as your server works, who cares :-)
 haha buhman, you must be new
 its always delayed a few hours
 its usually released sometime during the night (if you are in america)
 so just chill with us, and start making a list of all the cool natty customizations to do
 ssh port should always be changed from default. bots usually wont waste the time scanning alts
 if an admin changes the ssh port, chances are that admin added other layers of protection
 hackers want to 22 noobs haha
 herbs, i think we should ask Sony about that
 ssh on 22 is just so lazy
 read logs, ban ip addresses
 im more worried about all the phpmyadmin hacks out there than ssh hacking
 ah, my server isnt running phpmyadmin . but those hacks are so nasty on all the wordpress and cms sites
 phpmyadmin was a bit of a silly idea in the first place
 cordoval, you got your data backed up?
 ls, as always.. ubuntu is never released at the strike of midnight
 question, how do i properly remove a ppa from ubuntu? added that xmbc ppa and now its giving me all types of errors
 ty kindly @ vibhav
 you need to own the .com
 and i doubt you are buying the ubuntu.com domain anytime soon so... gl
 new ubuntu is never released at midnight sharp
 just wait, it will be released before the 29th
 torrent for the win
 tanath, give it a bit of space. it will work
 not enough to get Adobe to port photoshop
 i spent yesterday using gimp, its growing on me
 kaatta, i think the basic gui is much better in gimp. photoshop is a bloated mess. tasks dont "flow" intuitively
 tanath, true. i could see it being the pixelmator (on osx) type killer app for ubuntu with some refinement
 i dont mind the windows. no worse than adobes floating bars
 beta 2 -> update.... thats as close as you can get to 11.04 final atm
 traskers: click and hold on the icons, they will float. move at will :-)
 the new ati driver is working nicely for me (full unity, lower system temps)
 i think some apps dont have launcher icons yet?
 eiriksvin, laucher cannot be moved atm, yes i know that sucks a bit
 servers getting hammered
 i waited 9minutes for a 1mb file. thats release day for you
 torrent iso -> burn iso to DVD or usb key -> install as either upgrade or clean install
 eiriksvin, do trust. we had a big conversation about the lack of unity customization atm. im sure someone will create a way to move the launcher within a month (hacked or official)
 if you want new ubuntu quickest, always preload the beta then do the system updates to final release. too late now for that strategy to work though haha
 eiriksvin, on the login screen. look at the bottom bar. change "ubuntu" to "ubuntu classic" and login. done
 eiriksvin, yes. i have 2 profiles 1 unity and 1 classic. the change is instant and you can easily switch back and foward
 shane4ubuntu, go to the login screen. look at the bottom bar of that screen. change "ubuntu" to "ubuntu classic" and login. repeat to switch back. very easy but easily overlooked.
 unity is great but you do have to change the way you think about opening/moving/organizing your desktop apps
 give unity a full week of use (and make sure you know the keyboard shortcuts) and i think most people will be ok with it
 im almost sure WoW works in wine
 i miss docky, unity needs proper docky like widget imo. but no point in having TWO docks (unity + docky) at the same time
 flash sucks on linux. always has. probably always will.
 weather app is there, you can install from terminal
 user / downloads folder @ monotoko
 monotoko, open the menu for firefox and change the default downloads directory for saving items
 monotoko, menu -> edit -> preferences -> change the downloads folder
 haha, my system is a1-2% cpu usage with xchat, nat, and chrome open. shoots up to 44% on flash video haha
 the weather indicator install instructions are here:  http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/things-to-tweak-fix-after-installing.html
 markSS, give unity a week and make sure you are using keyboard shortcuts. it will grow on you.
 i hated unity too at first, now i love it
 im amazed how resistant linux users (of all people) are to a gui change.
 r000t, do trust. i know where gnome3 and classic ubuntu are at. i am NOT a hostage to anything
 no
 users are the fail for not trying the new unity interface for more than a week
 remember everyone is still grumbling about the osx buttons from 10.04 lol
 love (though it toke time + learning the keyboard shortcuts)
 ati users, remember that the new offical ati driver is out for 11.04. try that first.
 unity is gnome
 coty91, this is true. i hope we get advanced customizations for unity asap
 ohsix, i have ccsm, tell me how to move unity to the bottom of the screen? yep, you cant
 panels in 10.10 = massive customization potential... unity = not so much
 good guide to natty customization: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/things-to-tweak-fix-after-installing.html
 naw, its not my blog. but it was very helpful to me (getting weather app back etc)
 the goal with unity and osx lion was more focus on full screen apps. if you think about the gui with that in mind it helps ease the transition to unity
 Scarra3, ati has released offical drivers for 11.04 ati cards. i will link you
 Scarra3: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx
 switch to classic ubuntu = login screen -> look at bottom panel -> change "ubuntu" to "ubuntu classic" -> login -> done
 switch to classic ubuntu instructions: go to login screen -> look at bottom panel -> change "ubuntu" to "ubuntu classic" -> login -> done
 open with archive manager
 ninjai: its the "take screenshot" app (yes that is the name)
 nanjai the take screenshot app will allow you to do that
 ninjai: go to the Take Screenshot app. open it. select "grab an area" and select your area. done
 guys the screenshot app allows you to capture a smaller area, no need for gimp
 updating ubuntu right now is like shopping at best buy during Dec 23rd. you know what you are getting into
 bonny: try the indy humble games? revenge of the titans runs well on my system
 switch to classic ubuntu instructions: go to login screen -> look at bottom panel -> change "ubuntu" to "ubuntu classic" -> login -> done
 rehan: it depends on the hardware.
 ubuntu using 3% here and i have quite a few apps open
 shoogy: you will do fine. :-)
 the offical ati drivers are out for 11.04... no clue about nvidia atm
 switch to classic ubuntu instructions: go to login screen -> look at bottom panel -> change "ubuntu" to "ubuntu classic" -> login -> done
 you are still using linux. :-)
 calibre keeps locking up in natty (using software center version)
 switch to classic ubuntu instructions: go to login screen -> look at bottom panel -> change "ubuntu" to "ubuntu classic" -> login -> done
 bashelina: be nice. please.
 vanguard: yes, though the offical ati drivers have been released by amd
 vandguard: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx
 kyle_: learn the keyboard shortcuts .. it helps alot. i hated it too. love unity now.
 switch to classic ubuntu instructions: go to login screen -> look at bottom panel -> change "ubuntu" to "ubuntu classic" -> login -> done
 i use deja dup for all my backups. its in the software center
 keepassX is good for encypted password storage
 ohsix: so very true. but i need to use my passwords on osx and win machines too. so im forced to keepassX :-(
 lol @ switching back to windows to avoid problems. have fun installing two dozen drivers and redoing it at the first virus
 coco: feelings are very mixed. but i think with time most people will enjoy the changes (aka unity)
 Kyle_: a lot of users are upgrading apps. expect software center to be a bit slow.
 the system tray is obsolete in unity afaik
 pp7_: you get a launcher icon for unity. and certain apps are allowed to place icons/info in the top bar (like the system indicators) .. and thats it
 fermisan: not likely if you are careful about your gfx drivers
 sometimes removal is better for the greater good, i dislike iOS but i admire the "unity" of the overall interface across apps (pun intended)
 test unity for a week, make sure to use keyboard shortcuts and try to think of the OS in terms of full screen apps.
 captainkrek: not yet, i have an hp wireless laser printer. going to be troublesome getting that to work
 app switching is easy, i use 8 virtual windows and win+s  or win+w
 cryovat: what OS do you find is easier for app switching?
 cryovat: i see your point. perhaps a few indicators for windows and window switching that can be customized would improve the mouse workflow
 cryovat: im sure someone will expand upon the basic unity configuration options. till then, we still have classic ubuntu as an option
 cryovat: i like the indicator change. far too many apps put needless icons in the task bars
 on the bright side, we are only going to gain customization options for unity from here forward
 really computer savvy people dont want to waste time on customization. they want it to just work imo.
 switch to classic ubuntu instructions: go to login screen -> look at bottom panel -> change "ubuntu" to "ubuntu classic" -> login -> done
 likki: install chrome or chromium from the software center and see if your url clicks work properly there
 likki: if they do, something screwed up your firefox install.. or like the others mentioned.. you are middle clicking
 likki: make sure you are not shifting focus between multiple firefox tabs by accident
 likki: the pages you are accessing when you click on urls, are they pages you have already seen? or are they new pages? (wondering if you are toggling your history urls by accident )
 deja dup is awesome
 likki: sometimes? hum. make sure ask you click a url you do not see the url bar (where you enter the txt url like http... ) change or flash
 likki: also make sure you are not accidentally hitting your keyboard keys as you mouse click
 of you are ok with the performance hit, full encryption is ok
 you would be better suited using truecrypt to encrypt only what you absolutely must protect imo
 kyle: just ask :-)
 kyle__: usb booting was bugged during the betas. not sure if it has been fixed, wabi was also bugged for windows
 unity
 switch to classic ubuntu instructions: go to login screen -> look at bottom panel -> change "ubuntu" to "ubuntu classic" -> login -> done
 good day all
 nvidia? hum, ati released new drivers for 11.04.. has nvidia done the same yet?
 flodine: if, and only if, nvidia has released new 11.04 drivers you should use those
 zenocon: that is unity, and you can change the settings using compiz settings manager
 zenocon: that is window dodge, it will autohide on contact with an active window
 same here @ tepster
 will be a banned record soon enough
 11.04 making too many people rage in chat :(
 thedemon007: the installer will detect your OSs. in case if 10.10 you have the option to upgrade
 dagon: this release is very usable if you take the time to learn how to 1) use fullscreen apps and 2) use keyboard shortcuts. I love it.
 you can boot into classic ubuntu (login screen -> look at lower menu -> change "ubuntu" to "classic ubuntu" -> login)
 if you believe unity to be flawed, dont use it and instead boot to classic (and enjoy your panels etc)
 its still light years better than windows and no apple tax like a mac, no real room for unity complaints
 really? wow i never knew copy worked that way.
 boomboorum: yes, pidgin for starters
 ubuntu 11.04 is there a way to change the wallpaper of the login screen? thanks
 anyone know how to change the login screen wallpaper on ubuntu 11.04? thanks
 Dr_Willis: thanks, I'll go searching for that file. All the google hits told me to use ubuntu tweek to do it, but i dont see a 11.04 version of that app yet.
 thanks @ Dr_Willis & botcity
 ActionParsnip: some people want to customize. you could say the same thing about any part of the OS really
 ActionParsnip: I full screen most of my apps so I barely see the desktop wallpaper. :-)
 mamad: apt-get would be here i think
 be very careful with the rm command...
