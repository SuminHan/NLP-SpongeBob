 Hey guys, I'm having a problem with compiz. Anyone who can help?
 I'm using an nvidia card with the proprietary drivers installed and when I drag windows it stutters a lot.
 It happens in both Unity and Classic, so I assume it's a compiz issue.
 It's okay. Where is the soft window option?
 Fading Windows or Wobbly Windows?
 Fading is checked, Wobbly is not.
 I'm currently in the no effects desktop right now. I'll relog into compiz.
 Okay, now I'm in the compiz login. :)
 The windows wobble, but it's still stuttering.
 I'm running a tri-core Phenom 8650, 6gb DDR2, nvidia GTX 260, and 11.04
 I'm using the proprietary drivers as well.
 So, is anyone else having any window stuttering issues in Unity/Compiz?
 Okay, I've done a fair amount of work trying to find any solution to this, but I cannot. Does anyone in here know why my windows are stuttering when moving them under Compiz?
 My machine is more than enough to run it, and I'm using an nvidia gtx 260 with the proprietary drivers. I am kinda lost at this point.
 mlankhorst: I enabled nothing manually, it's only what comes default on Natty.
