 bloopletech, but i really dont know what i am killing as names are not familiar except few like mozila and thunderbird
 suddenly my comp is running slow
 what should i do??
  nothing has changed
 is there anyway i can find what r the processes running
  most of the processes r sleeping
  but available swap is just 3%
 ps aux throws a list of % CPU and i dont know what to do with them
 how can i make it run fatser as earlier??
 its getting better now
 do i have to perform this KILL process everytime
 bloopletech, its getting a bit better by killing some of the processes
