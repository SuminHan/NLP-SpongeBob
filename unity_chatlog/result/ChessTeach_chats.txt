 i want to set up raid0 on my computer, but I couldn't find the option in BIOS. It is a brand new computer, do some newer computers not support RAID?
 Tangaroa: do my sata hard drives need to be in consecutive slots? one is in slot 1, and the other 3
 stefg: speed
 stefg: really it won't help much? is that because i am not able to do the raid through the bios?
 how does lvm work? do I install ubuntu on one hard drive, then install lvm and it begins using the second drive?
 If I have two hard drives, can I use LVM to divide data between them similiar to RAID drives?
 Does FakeRAID provide any preformance benefits?
 iceroot: which isn't much?
 iceroot: ok thanks
 Halzen: my bios doesn't support the hard array
 Halzen: it isn't possible to download a new bios that will support RAID, correct?
 iceroot: i thought you said there isn't any benefits to it
 iceroot: but software raid is worth it?
 iceroot: preformance
 iceroot: yes
 iceroot: i know, i bought a backup external in case that happens
 iceroot: what is ssd?
 iceroot: oh, yeah i guess that would of been better
 iceroot: but i already have the two hard drives
 Halzen: how much is that though?
 spyhermit: I guess I will take what I can get
 Halzen: if I could return my drives, I think I would, but I do not have the recipts\
 iceroot: So I need to get the alternative Ubuntu CD to do the software raid right?
 iceroot: what do I need
 iceroot: how?
 spyhermit: I am still considering that idea
 Thanks again guys
