 wow the UI in Natty got all kinds of messed up
 on my Docked IBM T60 with second monitor The Unity launcher doesn't work
 and, while the new scroll bars are awesome, they only work 50% of the time for me
 yeah I'm back on classic, still having some issues here and there
 I love this channel because it's always jumpin
 Nighthwk: I like FileZilla
 or you can always use the command line
 Is it always this busy in here or is the frenetic pace of conversation due to the recent release of Natty?
 good ol cent
 they have RHEL 6 yet?
 RHEL 5 is so old
 but damn is it stable
 should i try out KDE? My gnome session and Unity sessions are quite buggy?
 on RHEL 5 I used KDE, then I tried KDE on Ubuntu right when 4.0 dropped and ran back to gnome
 but I bet it's stable now
 I like the customization options and Dolphin
 but desktop widgets get on my nerves
 too shiny
 man no scroll bar in Empathy under 11.04
 (Ubuntu classic)
 and the window docking is all kinds of messed up
 kk9822: have you tride some lubricant?

 Does anybody have any thoughts on resizing an encrypted /home partition?
