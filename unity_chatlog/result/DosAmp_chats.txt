 say, the link to http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.04/ubuntu-11.04-netbook-i386.iso.torrent under "Alternative downloads" is a copy-and-paste error, is it? can't find a netbook remix for natty anywhere else
 mithridates: no, it's still gnome 2.32 with unity interface
 unity runs fine on my nvidia card with nouveau + experimental gallium3d acceleration :)
 twig111: the file is named "ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso". without the "beta2".
 jonii2: you can choose ubuntu (unity) or ubuntu classic at the bottom of the login screen. you need 3d acceleration drivers for unity.
 oh
 kkal: what's broken with alt+f2? it looks like the app dialog, but it's actually a launcher
 e.g. i can type "gconf-editor" even though it's not under applications
 twig111: look at my answer above. drop the "beta2" part.
 it won't work with the final zsync
 bite-android: / is the root of the Unix filesystem. you need at least a partition for this, everything else is pretty optional
 bite-android: unless you need support for hibernation, you usually don't need a swap file with 2 gb or more ram
 hello Ultimate_Chaos
 crasbe: psss, you're ruining my disguise ;)
 what is it Ultimate_Chaos
 kick in 3, 2, 1...
 Ultimate_Chaos plymouth is the ubuntu splash screen, can you still log on?
 i'll only shed a tear about xeyes when ubuntu's ever shifting to wayland
 yes Calif, natty narwhale is codename for 11.04
 [thor]: should i better backup 10.10 and install 11.04 from scratch?
 Andrew131: sadly, only runlevel for this is 1
 Andrewx: just switching? Strg+Alt+F1
 delete your login manager (gdm, kdm etc.) from your default runlevel
 does ubuntu use tcp_wrappers (/etc/hosts.{allow,deny}) or firewall only?
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Wrapper <- i mean this. for example, arch linux uses this per default for sshd etc.
 tiger_eye: if it's just a linux kernel parameter, why not just change /etc/default/grub and add this as a default parameter?
