 hey guys... i'm having an issue with 11.04... i can barely use it. it's sooooooooooooooooo slow. like constantly freezing, even in gnome safe mode
 i had no problem at all with 10.10
 ultra fast etc.
 it seems to be because of the 2.6.38 kernel... if i try to boot using an older kernel its uber fast
 does anyone else seem to have experienced this ?
 anyone...
 apparently not
