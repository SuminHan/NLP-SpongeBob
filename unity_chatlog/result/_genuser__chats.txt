 hello people
 anybody using netbuntu?
 guys anyone using netbuntu? the new launcher is too annoying. how to turn it off?
 xangua: not even netbuntu?
 xangua: #netbuntu is empty.
 I figured ubuntu users would be the ones using netbuntu.
 celthunder: that is why I specifically said NETBUNTU.
 it has a launcher that comes with the install for the netbooks. for easy app launching.
 oh well.
 when doing an upgrade, can't you upgrade to the latest?
 I just did an upgrade and it says there's another. which would suck 'coz that's two of them in a row.
 hello people.
 can you not upgrade to the latest one shot?
 after upgrading once, it now says there's a newer version.
 that's like two upgrades.
 10.04 netbuntu edition. it might be a regular install with special gnome reconfigured.
 to 10.10. and now it find 11.xx.
 man internet going nuts.
 rather connectivity
 man internet connection is going nuts
 soreau: you could just kill X.
 the ole panels were nice in unity, eh?
 soreau: so you logged out finally?
 it's taking a while but the new unity in 10.10 is making sense.
 and 11.04 is upgrading
 the rtl818x is pretty common. it should have kernel support.
 wait richiefrich uses ubuntu also?
 richiefrich: hey there. see you in gentoo too
 richiefrich: nice to see someone from gentoo chan. :) I'm using netbuntu on a netbook and it's the unity thing that's bugging me too. I upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 and now I don't like unity. Upgrading to 11.04 to be able to use newer autohide crap....
 my the rain storm is kicking my internet in/out.
 cmdbbq: in the new toolbar?
 cmdbbq: just drag the thing you want off, off ot the side till is shows you X. it will remove it.
 the main thing with unity on a netbook is it's trying to command 1" of a 10" screen. don't care what the devs were thinking, they were wrong.
 cmdbbq: that's why I'm upgradin to autohide the sidepanel.
 cmdbbq: don't even know about the revamp on the auto notification area.
 richiefrich: http://askubuntu.com/questions/6302/how-can-you-remove-unity
 richiefrich: haven't tried that yet. STill upgrading to 11.04.
 richiefrich: you see the link?
 richiefrich: lol, that upgrade part I don't know. In the update-manager windows in Settings, you can at least set it to only show LTS release or something. I think that's for upgrade. For updates, I guess I just always say no....
 richiefrich: lol. There's the Startup Application Preferences. That has a line saying Update Notifier, you can uncheck that too.
 richiefrich: that fix will work nice too. :)
 richiefrich: from unity, Applications -> System -> Startup Application Preferences
 fisix: iwconfig shows wireless ones, no?
 richiefrich:  you like? :)
 richiefrich: getting ready to reboot and see what 11.04 looks like and then disable unity if possible....
 richiefrich: hehe, I would really use gentoo on the netbook that's why I bought it, to play with gentoo more for lean setup. but then I thought who wants to compile gtk on a 1.66GHz single core....
 richiefrich: would be fun those to install gentoo using distcc with a faster one around. :)
 richiefrich: I guess most of the things would work fine that way. Using rsync... the wifi stuff is the only thing to worry about....
 richiefrich: cool idea
 richiefrich: if the wifi is supported in kernel, it would be super.
 well then, mission gentoo might be a go.
 richiefrich: FF4 is out already?
 only if there was internet explorer for linux that worked fast.
 I really like FF3 on linux. Just that I'm used to IE8 on my win machine and switching between the two is kinda one of those things where I want to just have the same browser.
 but FF is pretty cool in what it does. it has definitely beat chromium into it's place
 I use windows also and IE is already on it. And it just works. better than any other browser on there. So I use it.
 meh, I don't really worry about what someone might think of it. It just works and works nice.
 now like FF works the best on linux. and I tried chromium and again use FF. 'coz chromium was just blah.
 last command of an upgrade... says upgrade has failed.
 2hrs spend for .... no upgrade.
 argh!!!!
 mathews: oh you and your fake ubuntu love. We were just discussing browsers and I explained why I use IE. put a sock it bud.
 richiefrich: lol, the upgrade failed and I gotta now figure out if the system is usable lol.
 only if there was a way to reboot without doing that.
 lol, new message upgrade complete. right after message saying upgrade failed. it will not run rollback package cleaner some thing.
 richiefrich: it just said some stuff was probably unstable didn't say why it failed. the main thig that failed that I saw was samba. let's just hope it was the only package.
 ok that's the last time I do upgrade on ubuntu.
 after 11.04 upgrade when I log it, it
 ust shows a black background and nothing. Anybody seen that before and how to fix it?
 having ot login to netbuntu 2D session.
 ZykoticK9: lol, I wouldn't either now. I'm experienced too.
 now.
 now, important topic.
 does anyone know how to downgrade?
 to 10.10?
 short of install fresh install from 10.10 media/
 ah, so basically ubuntu is too busy trying to be new windows they don't care about users....
 check.
 thanks guys.
 bullgard4: hehe, it's probably faster too. the upgrade took 4hrs from 10.04 to 10.10 and then 3 hr to 11.0.
 bullgard4: you konw I kept thinking on every update/upgrade waring ot just ignore it. and then I hit upgrade.
 bullgard4: anyway, thanks. :)
 ok ubuntu about to get unstable.
 just changed a bunch of lines.
 errrr they let you have linux in iran?
 anybody on lucid?
 10.04?
 usr13: can I ask you to please post your /etc/apt/sources.list file? please?
 usr13: using pastebin.
 richiefrich: hehe, the install is gone to heck. So either gotta use 10.04 sources.list to install all packages from it, OR re-install.
 usr13: thanks so much. I apprecaite your help.
 richiefrich: no, it doens't even load ANYTHIGN>
 richiefrich: just a blackscreen.
 richiefrich: but that's why you don't upgrade. which is what you just did.
 richiefrich: meaning you restricted the upgrade.
 richiefrich: yeah, I won't be upgrading either once 10.04 is installed.
 richiefrich: lol, i win. that's funny.
 richiefrich: nah, it's the same thing. like firefox, netscape, and tons others used to get in to the office in the morning run source checkout of mozilla and rebrand it and release it. And they all had same security bugs. lol.
 richiefrich: ok, so I just fixed up all the sources.list file to lucid ones and now update manager says run a partial upgrade. errr partial upgrade to what? lol.
 richiefrich: running that. since I think I miht have to reinstall anyhoo.
 richiefrich: it's a fun experience. if it works or if it's a re-install. I might get to finally luks encrypt the /. :)
 richiefrich: I'd be curious too. Using truecrypt for windows, I was noticing on AES, it was noticeably slow. Very noticeable. On linux those I'd only do the swap and home partition on a slow computer.
 richiefrich:  will do. if not here in #gentoo. :) looking to get the raid1 server to LUKS eventually
 richiefrich: you have a channel?
 richiefrich: lot of work to keep it going no?
 ok, time to rsyn /home and re-install.
 rsync
 dang it.
 using ctrl-w in console for word delete and in firefox has totally different reaction
 rebooting.
