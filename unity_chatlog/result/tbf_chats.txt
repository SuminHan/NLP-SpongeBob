 how again do i re-arrange launchers in the sidebar?
 ...thought i've done it once, but cannot remember how
 richiefrich: the unity thing
 richiefrich: pretty sure i did
 ...but right now right click pans that dock
 kezzawd: wtf... ubuntu also comes with such mess now?
 are we back at windows 95?
 (with it's infamous tweak ui)
 ubottu: emotions. emotions. it __really__ upset's me that suddenly both unity and gnome-shall resort to ux mess like windows 95's tweak ui. it's a really bad sign.
 kezzawd: "dragging off".... hmm.... let's see
 kezzawd: that was the trick! thanks alot!
 so now i only have to figure out how to edit launchers, unity imported from gnome shell. have one with horribly upscaled icon.
 well, alternative: how do i add custom launchers (without pre-installed .desktop file)
 kezzawd: don't have a desktop file for this app... but let's try
 kezzawd: no, that's the wrong instance
 kezzawd: (not surprisingly) took the app it found in path (or however) - not the shell script
 richiefrich: why? unity is pretty cool. just needs a bit polish. guess we finally have to admit, mark is a visionary
 richiefrich: of unity or mark? :-D about unity? sure, not entirely polished yet - what do you expect for a first release. but then a big step forward over the old panel and much saner ux story than gnome-shell
 very big fan of how it turns each maximized app into some kind of full screen app, by moving titlebar and menubar into the top panel
 â†’ goodbye F11 fullscreen shortcut, you  are redundant now
 kezzawd: feared i'd have to manually create a .desktop file. well. ok.
 kezzawd: thank you
 hey, the x-chat icon shows when i got pinged on irc... sweet!
 kezzawd: thanks for all your help. i am happy for the moment :-)
 is it somehow possible to directly view the patches ubuntu applies to some package? e.g. there: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+source/qt4-x11/
 natty's epiphany is incredibly crashy :-(
