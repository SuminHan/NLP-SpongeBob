 Hey everyone... i installed 11.04 and now i can no longer connect to my wifi.. doesnt even show up, other AP's show up.. tested it from my 10.10 box, works fine... any ideas?
 broadcom.. uses the STA driver soreau
 sgaap: dns cache has nothing to do with a ssid not showing hehe
 soreau: that is added to that site for 11.04?
 soreau: ok cuz this is a ubuntu 11.04 issue alone.. 10.10 and less works fine
 but brb lemme try this
 soreau: yea, and when i scan i get 10+ SSID's but not my own
 soreau: btw i cant really use that site, i cant get online, eth doesnt work either
 i feel like smacking a fist trugh my monitor... :(
