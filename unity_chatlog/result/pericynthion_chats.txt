 Hi all - got a problem with 11.04 on a MacBook, is this a good place to ask for support?
 Summary: I was triple-booting OSX/Win7/Ubuntu 10.10 using rEFIt, and all was working pretty well.  I did a distribution upgrade to 11.04, and now only OS X will boot.  Choosing anything else from rEFIt gives a black screen with blinking cursor.
 I've tried: reinstalling rEFIt, booting from livecd and reinstalling grub2, neither of which helped.  To even get it to boot from the live cd I had to choose acpi=off
 Jordan_U: I'm not sure. How do I tell?
 Jordan_U: I mounted /dev/sda1, which is the ~200MB EFI partitition, to /mnt/root and /dev/sda5, which is the linux root partition, to /mnt, and then did grub-install â€”boot-partition=/mnt/root /dev/sda
 Jordan_U: first time I tried that it complained about lack of a bios partition, or something along those lines involving blocklists, so I marked sda1 as grub/bios using gparted and then it installed
 but no change in boot symptoms
 ok - oops, I guess.  I don't think anything important was on there, AFAIK it is just for EFI firmware updates
 should I have used a different grub-install command?
 Jordan_U: ok, if I create such a small partitition should I mount that into /mnt/boot before issuing that grub-install command?
 ok
 so /mnt/boot will exist as a part of my main root partition?
 ok, thanks.  I'll try that.
 back in 15 mins or so (no wifi support on the livecd)
 Jordan_U: That worked.  Thanks for the help!
