 Is there a way I can have FFmpeg not use as much CPU?
 it's making my system overheat
 @cabbagemoonlight sudo apt-get install openssh-server
 What should I do if an application I'm trying to compile needs libgtk1.2-dev?
 ohsix: libgtk1.2-dev is no longer available with apt-get :(
 ohsix: Putty
 logi01: if you use the "old" gnome UI
 ohsix: the application needs 1.2
 tasslehoff: If you use google chrome, you can enable it on gmail.com
 ohsix: I'm going to be using the code from Putty to experiment with SSH
 ohsix: Doing a make now instead of using the script provided, looks like it's going good
 ohsix: I get warning: macro `AM_PATH_GTL` not found in library
 pattysmatt: an RSS program gets a feed from a server, where for example a website updates you on new articles and such
