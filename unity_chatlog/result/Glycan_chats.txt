 Hello.
 How do I make it so that U boots before windows?
 Please explain,
 I deleted windows and now I can't boot.
 (On that box)
 Where?
 I'm on a seperate windows box;
 What are you talking about?
 Also, where is the boot sequance stored?
 Guys?
 This is a computer.
 In general.
 Not windows.
 It had windows on it.
 Now it doesn;t.
 Let's see...
 Well, at the very least
 Before, Win would load, ask me what I wanted to do, I woul dtell him to load U, U would ask me if I wanted to run safe mode or what, I woul dask for U, and I would give it to me.
 Then I killed Win, but it still points to win, and doesn't work.
 Also, the laptop this is happening on seems to turn of randomy, despite the fact that it's plugged in.
 Run U.
 Been there, done that.
 Doesn't work.
 Well, on a DVD
 sudo
 Special user-do
 Terminal.
 Otherwise, no idea
 Ahem, guys: "Can not mount /dev/loop/() (.cdrom/casper/filesystem.squshfs) on //filesystem.squashfs
 "
 Ditto me, I think.
 Where is the bloody boot sequance stored?
 What is HDD?
 Okay, good.
 I've got console-style acces instead of Ubuntu from a live cd.
 But at least that's soemthing.
 How do I get stuff working now?
 Where are the instructions on what to do on startup?
 You people?
 Where are the boot commands?
 Guys?
 This is a toshiba laptop
 How do I make startup point to U and not Win?
 Note: The only proper thing I can get to is "PhoenixBIOS Setup Utility", and a crapish text console of ubuntu from a live cd from which I can't find the other paritiions.
 Can anyone killaly help me?
 !
 !test
 Huh.
 Guys!!
 Please!
 Note: The only proper thing I can get to is "PhoenixBIOS Setup Utility", and a crapish text console of ubuntu from a live cd from which I can't find the other paritiions.
 Er.
 I had dual boot, then I half-killed Windows, and now nothing works.
 Becouse startup script points to Win, and Win points wherever you tell him to point to.
 ???
 Explain!!!
 Can someone helpme?
 Okay...
 I/my friend had Windows vista on a toshiba laptop. The screen broke, I took it from him, hooked it up to another screen, put U on it (11.04), the computer was very cluttered so I only put the gb partition, then when space became very tight I tryed cleaning the windows, deleted windows (didn't get my space back- How do you change partition borders?), then a while later when I rebooted, it tryed
 to poitn to windows (normally boot points to windows, and windows asks you what you want, and you go to ubuntu from there.), but most of windows wosn't there, so I can't get to U. A live CD I made only shows test console, and doesn't even let past the cd, I think. "BusyBox v1.17.1, build in shell (ash). How do I get to U?
 E.g. hwo do I make toshiba poitn directly to U.
 (Also how to resize partitions, but that's another story)
 Argh.
 Can someone help _me_?  I've been waiting for about an hour.
 Argh!
 Have you all muted me or something?
 No, I have important _files_ on the windows partition, and soem good stuff on the old ubuntu one, to.
 Er.
 Barition? Boot loader?
 ls
 Good grief
