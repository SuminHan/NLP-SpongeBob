 isn't 11.04 still out?
 ruan, but gnome won't be an option later
 ruan, i don't think any of desktop environments isn't on the way to good :)
 kaz56, what's problem?
 kaz56, can you pastebin the full error please?
 kaz56, looks like your mirror is not up-to-date or something
 try another mirror
 alternative? may it be net install iso?
 i've used net install disc a few times but didn't use alternate, i don't know
 Flare183, i see but i don't know the answer of kaz56's question
 DerpNauce, ps aux|grep <pid>|grep -v grep
 DerpNauce, you're welcome
