 what a waste downloading the new ubuntu release it's all kinds of wacked
 can I fix the task bars in the new release so it dont look like a messed up version of mac
 ubottu thank you kindly because this unity is garbage sorry lol
 lol
 should be called headache not unity lol
 How can you enable advanced features in the new Ubuntu release so I can have the wobbely windows etc The option is not there when you right click on the desktop
 howkj1, I have it installed but you have to enable advanced visual features when you right click on the desktop and go to change backround, in this new release it's not there for some reasion and I'm in classic mode too when I logged on because the unity is another mess lol
 well you are not missing much with Unity ketema It looks like a twisted messed up version of a mac oc
 os
 ketema, can you get a login screen when you fire up your box? If so on the bottom you have to select classic
 you have any desktop ketema or is it running in command line
 I'm not sure on that ketema
 I can't even get my advanced visual features to get enabled
 Same here ketema I'm not happy with this new release at all
 lol ketema atleast you are getting her up with linux though at her young age, I've been working on computers since I was like 13 and I'm 30 now but never ever dwelled into linux until a year ago.. Imagine what I could of learned years back
 Yes ketema I was drawn to it because of the user friendly aspect I'm in the process of getting around the OS using strictly the terminal I'm not completly lost on it I slung keys in dos for a long time when I was around 16 or so when the rockin 386 SX mother boards were out heh
 how do i get advanced
 this latest version is absolute garbage
 wtf i can scribble code with a crayon on a Denny's napkin that would run better
 this release is a waste of time
 Ubuntu I'm very dissapointed
 learn me how to get advanced features for my compiz
 bah why would they take that out
 rediculas
 and this unity thing should be called headache
 I hope for the love of god Ubuntu is not selling out
 it is installed
 tepster,
 why the heck is it gone
 anyone know how to get adavanced or is it totally gone
 I want my linux to look like the pc in the aracade in tron
 you know they use linux in legacy
