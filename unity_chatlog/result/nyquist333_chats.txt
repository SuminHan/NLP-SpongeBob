 Dr_Willis - Will my compiz settings work if I upgrade to 11.04?
 I don't understand, if I use GNOME will my compiz settings be there? Or would unity change them.
 Dr_Willis - So, after upgrading, I should disable unity?
 I'm trying 11.04 in a VM first, and I've backed up my base system.
 Ok, this is not cool. Can I safely remove zeitgeist and still have 11.04 work properly?
 Ok, I'm trying 11.04 in a VM. I've removed Zeitgest. I've used gnome-conf to turn off thumbnail cache, but the .thumbnails dir is still being created. How do I disable ALL thumbnail caching?
 ohsix: I've gone to a lot of pains setting up 10.10. I don't like anything tracking my usage, or indexing or thumbnailing my photos and yes porn.
 gconf-editor used to work.
 In the past I've actually redirected .thumbnails, .macromedia and tmp to a ram drive using /dev/shm. But it's a pain. Setting .thumbnails to root and read-only may also work. I don't understand why all this tracking stuff is turned on automatically.
 I understand, but your talkig to someone who deletes his recently used file and marks it read-only so it can't be updated.
 How do I protect privacy in Ubuntu when there isn't a single place to turn off history or thumbnails?
 smw: Hold on...
 sudo chattr +i .recently-used.xbel
 It's in your home dir. But it moved to .local/shared in 11.04
 Well, if I have photos on a flash drive, and I only use the flash drive once, it shows up in .thumbnails.
 So that sucks.
 ohsix: I'll check that out.
 I think there is an issue in 11.04. gconf is not letting me turn off thumbnail caching.
 ohsix: Clean up is nice, but I would really like it if nothing was ever written to the disk.
 No, no swap file.
 ohsix: Wow, desktop-metadata is even worse!! I thought windows was bad!
 True, and some videos. Could be worse? It's just some music vidoes.
 I guess the only real way to keep things locked down is to use full disk encryption. There's just too many leaks. Or run from a LiveCD.
 ohsix: why? It's the best way to keep windows from tracking things. Enterprise environments want this level of privacy to protect IP.
 ohsix: Performance liability? Ubuntu privacy mix is a very good idea for maintaing and handling confidential data. A law firm may not want a case # to be viewable in some cache somewhere. How do you keep things from leaking?
 ohsix: In any case. I think I will open a lauchpad case for the tumbnail cache that used that can't be disabled.
 ohsix: Very true. I've had this argument in several design discussions. However, most places just make every thing equally important and encrypt it.
 I can give you many examples where a computer has to be involved and the data needs to be all contained. The computer should not be the enemy logging everything making it impossible to clean up history. Firefox has a privacy mode it would be cool if the OS also had one.
 ohsix: Is that good or bad? I think you can do smart card log on with linux? I've never set it up.
 ohsix: Are you a ubuntu developer?
 ohsix: I was just wondering why this trend of Zeitgeist and file indexing has been going full speed ahead. I installed konversation recently, and next thing i know I've got 2 new indexers running in my home directory, by default! Is this normal now a days?
 Some Zeitgeist developers don't seem to understand why someone doesn't want to use it. The trend seems to be if you want privacy somethings wrong with you.
 True, a unified search is cool, but I should be able to turn that off. You can't have every feature and have the same privacy profile. I understand that.
 ohsix: thanks for the info. I have to go. I'll keep playing with 11.04.
 linusasu6: Quick update. What issues are you seeing with 11.04? I have to go, but would like to know.
