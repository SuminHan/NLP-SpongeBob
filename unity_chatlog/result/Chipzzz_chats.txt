 tomasz: floodbot tells you not to type too many lines without a break
 tomasz: they are having tech problems... floodbot is checking for bots while they fix it
 HrT: you may have to cd to the directory where aticonfig resides or use the full path to invoke it
 justyellowboy: when you save a file as a PNG a dialog opens that should allow you to adjust the format (unless it started out as a PNG)
 MrTolkinghorn: I'm running 2.6.32-31 on two machines & they're both very stable
 justyellowboy: compression level is not the same as bits/pixel
 sycko: is the webcam plugged into a hub?
 sycko: you might try lsdev & see if you have an interrupt conflict
 tixo5: which packages?
 renegaid: fwiw, I've had much better results with plain alsasound than with the pulseaudio that comes with Ubuntu
 nzashadow: Did you look through the logs for clues?
 nzashadow: alt-ctl-t will get you a terminal & you can dmesg or cat the logs
 nzashadow: or you can boot into a command line & look at the logs from the last run
 :)
 nzashadow: hold down shift while the machine is booting & you can select it from the grub menu
 :)
 ocx: try "apt-cache search sqlite3"... maybe you don't have the repo available
 ocx: I think "bg" should work
 mr_orange: one possibility is that the grub parameters are wrong
 mr_orange: here's something that might help: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1169670
 Speak up, WindowNumOne... what's the problem?
 mr_orange: the grub entry for Ubuntu may not be pointing to the right place on the partition or may have another incorrect parameter
 WindowNumOne: grub has a timeout delay that may now be set to 0 rather than 5... hold down the shift key while the machine boots & you can edit the grub menu
 WindowNumOne: you can reinstall it with grub-install
 WindowNumOne: Are you installing it in the correct partition?
 WindowNumOne: are you planning to reinstall Windows & dual boot?
 lol
 WindowNumOne: I've read that if you plan to dual boot with a window$ partition, you must install window$ first or anticipate great difficulties
 htop is better than top... lets you choose the kill signal
 nano, vi, vim...
 "--purge"
 kallisti5: you can boot into a failsafe graphics mode that will work with anything for testing purposes
 Cairo: I think the url is still ng
 Cairo: the url is paste.ubuntu.com/602073 ... the www was messing it up
 Cairo: I think the answer lies in line 115
 Cairo: I'm not sure... I would start by removing any traces of the proprietary driver that may be present (although I don't see any mention of it in the log) & reinstalling the default drivers
 Silentmyst: have you read this?
 Cairo: yes
 (if memory serves)
 Rehan lsmod
 Rehan: I don't have a machine with an nVidia card to check right now but I think you need the nouveau driver... here's the step-by-step from Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
 Dark_Star1: Did u try a bridged connection?
 d-snake: you can deselect it in the menu editor & it won't show up in the menus
 sahil: is that a new install?
 elb0w: you could try booting to the recovery console & then the failsafe video
 insanity99: doesn't it have the sensors applet?
 *groans* Glad I stuck with 10.10... How about screenlets? does it run them?
 ActionParsnip: That's a good idea as well
 ActionParsnip: Thanks for that... I'll consider it
 thummper: right click on them in the lower right corner, select preferences & select how many you want (evidently 1)
 thummper: I don't know... I haven't upgraded but I would expect that it would
 sahil: it sounds like there might be something wrong with the repository
 thummper: does 11.04 have a configuration editor?
 thummper: it would be in Applications->System Tools->Configuration Editor
 thummper: dunno... try searching for 'configuration editor'...
 thummper: you should be able to set the number of workspaces using it although I don't exactly how... in earlier versions, you would look in desktop->applications->window_manager
 thummper: look a little farther up at ActionParsnip's advice... he knows 11.04
 user82: put it in your fstab to make the mount persistant
 ask it
 Thanks lockal! That's GREAT!
 Cajun_Lan_Man: you could try disabling all your software sources (in synaptic) except for the cd
 ketma: can you stop the network manager?
 ketma: try sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager stop
 :)
 ketma: I have heard so many complaints about the upgrade that I haven't ventured to try it yet... sorry I can't be of much more help
 m4dv0y: did you try sudo apt-get --check ?
 m4dv0y sorry it's just sudo apt-get check
 ray24: man mount should help
 bassliner: you know where to find the sources ;)
 mikeddd: gksudo synaptic
 chR0n05: seems like sudo su is not an appropriate topic of conversation here
 Chr0n05: I arrived at the same conclusion by the same method ;)
 openntpd is a much better solution for maintaining an accurate clock: sudo apt-get install openntpd
 Radios: Micor$oft's patents, no doubt :/
 <-- sticking with gnome
 off topic
 lol
 network interface card
