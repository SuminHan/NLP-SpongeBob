 is 11.04 out yet?
 how can in install 11.04 onto a linux software raid?
 its a brand new install
 i have a ubuntu server iso, i want to get the desktop env also. what packages should i select?
 so i see --- ubuntu-desktop (246) ... but it just expands to a bunch of packages, not all of them are related.
 what app lets me change the kernel i boot up with? i jsut added a kvm kernel but its defaulting to boot the old kernel
 lcb: the delay is too short, my monitor goes into power save mode.
 lcb: ok, got the screen with kernels, but i don't see the kvm kernel.
 lcb: ok, doing recovery now
 lcb: well, i can boot in normal, but just wonder whats up with not getting the kvm kernel.
 what kernel should i install to run kvm?
 phoebe212: i read that but still need help on the kernel.
 When trying to make vm i see: "warning: kvm is not available. this may mean the kvm package is not installed, or the kvm kernel modules are not loaded. your virtual machines may perform poorly."
 i have the kvm kernel module loaded.
 anyone see systems you build with vmbuilder run fine, but when it comes time to restart them, the virtual disk files are missing?
