 *pokes around* My scanner isn't working... I got the driver and everything, and the printer part of it works, but it doesn't scan... can anyone help?
 anyone available to help with a printer/scanner issue?
 well I did try a couple times... I have a Brother MFC-6490CW and the printer works fine, but the scanner does not... I have both the printer, and scanner drivers for this model for linux, but it still doesnt work
 ActionParsnip, samtate: (in case you didnt see it, forgot to add names) well I did try a couple times... I have a Brother MFC-6490CW and the printer works fine, but the scanner does not... I have both the printer, and scanner drivers for this model for linux, but it still doesnt work
 ActionParsnip: i686
 ActionParsnip: the only drivers available for the printer/scanner, so yes
 anyone who can help with scanner issue that's not being occupied with somoene else at the moment?... My scanner (MFC-6490CW) will not work with Simple Scan, or Xsane Image Scanner, even though I have all the drivers installed... this is part of my income, so I need the scanner to work
 Rockj: that's a long list >.> *starts looking through for the scanner*
 RockJ: okaaay... did so... but how is knowing what th emessages say help me get the scanner working?
 Rockj: ok, now what?
 Rockj: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601009/
 Rockj: alright
 Rockj: that's the printer driver I installed, there's also a scanner driver for my MFC, and both are installed, and it still doesnt work
 Rockj: printer works perfectly, scanner doesnt
 ohsix: do I still need to if it half-works? printer part of it works fine, the scanner part is what I'm having trouble with
 ActionParsnip: I've had both printer and scanner drivers installed for a few days now
 Rockj: checked, and nothing says scanner or printer... I am the only user on this computer
 ActionParsnip: I've tried Simple Scan, Xsane Image Scanner, and GIMP
 Rockj: no scanner group
 ActionParsnip: only in the Xsane, "Invalid arguement"
 Rockj: as I ad, it's been a few days with these drivers and MFC
 as I said*
 rockj: it detected
 rockj: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601030/
 rockj: there is no scanner group
 Rockj: it says: device `brother3:bus7;dev1' is a Brother MFC-6490CW USB scanner
 Rockj: scanimage: open of device brother3:bus7;dev1 failed: Invalid argument

 rockj: I didnt have Ubuntu before, my Win XP crashed and I had no disc, and no money... so I got Ubuntu and upgraded as much as I could...
 rockj: WinXP crashed and burned*
 Rockj: I'll be back, I have to run something around the block
 Rockj: same result
 Rockj: I have the drivers for this MFC
 Rockj: both the printer and scanner drivers from that place
 Rockj: I got the 32 bit, the 64s are an invalid build

 Rockj: pressing scan > select oputput type > start color or B&W
 Rockj: aaand still nthing works
 Rockj: nope, nothing
 Rockj: I gotta run an errand, I'll be back and we can resume beating out heads on our desks about this
