 Anyone aware of any issue with Transmission icon not showing in systray on 11.04.  Already setcom.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist ['all']
 htcrwn18: updated from 10.10 to 11.04 yesterday with no real probelms. Just some little bugs
 htcrwn148: I just followed Canonical's instructions on ubuntu site and used update manager. No problems, though maybe cli has some benefits
 lcb: yes, as in instructions on ubuntu main sute
 santiago: still deciding :)
 bc81: yeah - 10.10 to 11.04 with minor niggled
 bc81: yeah - 10.10 to 11.04 with minor niggles
 Ubuntu_user: from the directory it's downloaded to. 'sh <filename>'
 openbees: me too - logout and back in when it happens. Only seems to be when changing some compiz settings
 openbees: I have this problem on 11.04. It's a bug, but can be worked aorund
 openbees: just set it up how you want, logout, and login and your panel should be okay. Works for me
 vak: I've done it. unity2d or unity or classic?
 vak: as puckipedia said - open Eclipse, then right cllick the icon in the launcher and 'Keep in launcher'
 insanity99: I like the idea, but it is annoyingly buggy
 baggar11: middle click on it
