 miiike: ,but really you don't need the  propritary driver installed in 10.10, unless you want some compiz effects, or a few 3D games,  11.04 which will come out pretty soon from now,  well things are a bit differnet there,  because the 3D version of the new Unity interface needs a propritary driver or experimental 3D driver.  in fact if you only just put 10.10 on a lap top, I would suggest waiting untill a bit later and then putting 11.04 on.
 hi
 Just now was the first time I joined this channel since last year,  or maybe I joined once earlier this year or something
 digdeep: oh you want to virtualmachine Ubuntu 11.04?
 !lts | KaAtta
 digdeep: I can link you to some proper instructions on how to virtual machine 11.04
 digdeep: actsaully I think for a virtual machine of 11.04, even though 11.04 isn't out just yet, this channel would be sort of ok, because you could be virtual machining it with a previous version of Ubuntu,  as host,  and you could with another distro as host as well
 !permissions | RedLance
 george: Drivers do not work in Wine
 george: or commmercial versions that are sold, for that matter
 george: and with  hardware it depends on the dsitro, if it just works or doesn't,  in general Linux distro's tend to work quite well with pretty standard PC hardware though. and hiexpo can probably help you properly :)
 RedLance: sure if set up right for Samba, you can do what you want, not sure how to do that myself though
 ubusammyn150: can't get anything from the repo's anymore?
 multipass: yes, but wait untill the final is out first, oh and if you do it on release day it may be rather slow to do
 multipass: also since 11.04 get's a major interface change with Unity,  you may want to keep 10.10 a while longer
 multipass: or dare I say it here :D look into some other distro
 multipass: also soon after 11.04 comes out, Canonical will have a web thing, so people can try in a web browser
 multipass: yes,  it will be Unity 2D thought no Unity 3D, but nearly the same thing, other then that yep like as if you had installed 11.04
 KM0201: I read it on at least one site, maybe two even
 KM0201: should be good yeah,  get people to try Unity like that first,  instead of them doing the upgrade, and then regretting it :d
 KM0201: indeed exactly
 KM0201: right, but since it's a virtual machine or whatever on a Canonical server, then I guess like that, should work with old computers even, since they aren't running it
 KM0201: also Unity 2D may work with your old computer, but that's only a ppa for 11.04
 KM0201: yeah XFCE is nice, but it's nice in loads of distro's not just Ubuntu :)
 Xubuntu even, above
 gogearvibe4g: I think Unity 2D is 11.04 only, also technically since, 11.04 isn't out just yet, the channel to talk about this would be #ubuntu+1
 gogearvibe4g: and 11.10 will probably use Unity 2D as the fall back intead of Gnome 2, since they will be using Gnome 3 underneath Unity for that one :D
 gogearvibe4g: Unity 2D ppa search Google for that, that omgubuntu link,   how they said to install it,  that should do it :)  oh and Gnome Shell is the way to go really, but no proper Gnome 3 with Gnome Shell experience as an option untill 11.04 it seems.  There's a ppa for 11.04, but not the  ful experience.
 gogearvibe4g: above I meant to put 11.10 for Gnome 3 proper expereince
 gogearvibe4g: as an option
 miiike: how did you install the Nivida driver?
 KM0201: see above what I said about Gnome 3 by the way :)
 gogearvibe4g: some other distro's already doing Gnome 3, and Fedora 15 will soon when it's released, and yeah.
 miiike: ok that should have worked really
 miiike: ,but really you don't need the  propritary driver installed in 10.10, unless you want some compiz effects, or a few 3D games,  11.04 which will come out pretty soon from now,  well things are a bit differnet there,  because the 3D version of the new Unity interface needs a propritary driver or experimental 3D driver.  in fact if you only just put 10.10 on a lap top, I would suggest waiting untill a bit later and then putting 11.04 on.
 apprentice3d: nope  11.04 later on Thursday
 apprentice3d: 28th is today in my time zone
 AbuMaia: well nearly had five hours here of the 28th,  kind of sad that I don't feel tired though in a way, because I been awake quite  a lot of hours now
 AbuMaia: wrong one
 apprentice3d: see above
 apprentice3d: no no count down, because no one knows for suer when it will be out yet
 apprentice3d: all we know is it's coming out on the 28th in most time zones, some time
 rww_: 18th ?
 hi ThomasUK
 ThomasUK: just got back to the computer, but I think quite a few people are going to other distro's,  because of 11.04, Unity being a main reason, to be honest
 ThomasUK: oh you tried it already then?
 ThomasUK: PXE system ?
 ThomasUK: right yeah, better to stay with 10.04 for the servers, since that's Long Term Support
 ThomasUK: 10.04 server edition to be exact,  since with the desktop you would only get the three years support, instead of the five
 ThomasUK: or you could go Debian or CentOS or something :D
 IdleOne: hmm ok
 jibel: Unity at the moment goes on top of Gnome 2, another interface for it, but for the next one, it will go on top of Gnome 3 instead of using their interface by default Gnome Shell
 !lts | g4
 escott: there's a ppa :)
 escott: i'll get a link hold on
 escott: oh wrong person
 Eduard: there's a Gnome 3 ppa, i'll get al ink
 Eduard: with the Gnome 3 ppa, you don't quite get the 100% proper full expereince, that you would get in other distro's that use it by default, but well if it works, should be ok enough for now
 Eduard: yeah just got a  bit of a browser issue, hold on
 petsounds: what's that a reasasonbly new Nivida card or?
 petsounds: also have you got a propitary Nivida driver installed or not?
 varunvyas: you got to go through 10.10
 !upgrade | Tom__
 !fianal | Tom__
 !final | Tom__
 Tom__: however even so ^ it may be a great idea to re install, to make 100% sure you have the proper expereince
 compdoc: yeah the repo's tend to be slow on release day
 !slow | compdoc
 petsounds: ok bingo, sounds like me with the Beta 2, but I found out about a little trick, to get Unity working, when the propritary driver freezes that may also work for you
 petsounds: remove the propritary driver from additional drivers, and then the experimental 3D support driver should show, install that, and it is more likely to work for you :)
 mikebot: there isn't one anymore, because Unity is now for both netbooks and Desktop
 mikebot: however Unity should be able to detect when it's running on a netbook or desktop, and then be slightly differnet as well
 petsounds: and would be interested to know if that works for you :)
 Eduard: trying to get the link for you now, but
 IdleOne: is there a factoid yet for the new help site by the way?
 IdleOne: yep that one
 Eduard: if you go to the askubuntu help site, and find the instructions for installing GNome 3, that's what you want.  with the beta 2 I used wrong instructions on another site, and ended up with a cross between Gnome 2 and Gnome 3 instead
 !support | Eduard
 vish: uh?
 IdleOne: yeah,  as you can see above gave that factoid to Eduard  who wants the Gnome 3 install instructions
 IdleOne: that's something else, if there isn't a factoid yet for installing Gnome 3 from the ppa, there should be really I think :)
 Eduard: ^
 IdleOne: last time I looked the ppa site itself,  wasn't really helpful on how to install it, but  someone suggested the askubuntu link for it, and that was good
 vish: well with beta 2, there was  something about it,  when I was there
 vandamsel: right yeah ok
 vandamsel: if you look in additioanl drivers, does it say the driver is installed and activiated or what?
 the propritary driver
 !md5sum | tdn
 !hashes | tdn
 cws: Unity?
 cws: ok I think I know why
 vandamsel: right, but I think you got a issue with teh propritary driver?
 vandamsel: Unity was froozen?  like cws
 vandamsel: uhmm was Unity froozen, for an hour or so on your desktop?
 vandamsel: oh ok, not Unity being froozen then
 syntheticLife: sounds like the repos are slow since it's release day
 !slow | syntheticLife
 !slow | coolman
 syntheticLife: no you don't upgrade using a torrent, you can get the ISO from a torrent
 coolman: what does what mean?
 syntheticLife: and  with 11.04 you can upgrade  your 10.10 install to 11.04 it seems using the ISO
 syntheticLife: well CD I should say once you got the contents of the ISO burnt to it
 coolman: on releae day,  many Ubuntu fans download the new release, as a result,  the servers  tend to get slow, be that for the ISO's,  or the repos/resporitories for Ubuntu
 tdn: jo-erlend #ubuntu+1 is closed for now, this is 11.04 now as well
 coolman: yes
 coolman: 11.04 got released earlier today
 coolman: no, but Gnome 3 came out on the 6th of April :)
 sburjan`: well not sure about VMware, but it can work with Virtualbox :)
 proq: for some effects, that's why it uses Compiz
 proq: however there's also already the Unity 2D version which you can get from a ppa, made with Qt what KDE uses, and that will probably be the default fall back for 11.10 instead of Gnome 2 with their Ubuntu specific changes
 arand: is it?  hmm it was a ppa
 arand: I thought it was still a ppa, but ok that's good if it's in the main repo
 somethingelse: sure Canonical's team will still continue work on it for 11.10
 somethingelse: the development versiosn of 11.10, will get the improvements to Unity yes
 shane4ubuntu: developmetn versions
 shane4ubuntu: it's unuseable right now, how so?
 shane4ubuntu: also if you find Unity unusable or whatever, give Gnoem Shell a try ;)  the new interface for Gnome 3 the default proper one :)
 shane4ubuntu: oh yeah I did
 somethingelse: see above was messging wrong guy again
 somethingelse: they do,  really  Gnome Shell is the proper version since that's from upstream Gnome, but Canonical wanted to do their own interface that was originally going to be for netbooks only  so yeah 10.10, but can use that on a desktop even :)   and  then it was decided that starting with 11.04 they would make for desktops as well, instead of going with Gnome Shell by default
 somethingelse: upstream Gnome, and Canonical had similar, but also differnet idea's on what they wanted for an interface, so yep both
 shane4ubuntu: Gnome Shell is the new interface for Gnome 3 :)  http://gnome3.org
 shane4ubuntu: Unity is currenlty on top of Gnome 2 in 11.04, but will be on top of Gnome 3 for 11.10  whilst being used instead of Gnome Shell by default.  and with 11.10 people should be able to install the uhmm 100% proper Gnome 3 expereince from the repo's no problem.  where as with 11.04 Gnome 3 is an optional ppa, which lacks a few things
 somethingelse: look t the message I just sent shane4ubuntu as well :)
 macross: heh
 somethingelse: no upstream Gnome and Canonical are moving more away more from each other, since the new interfaces,  under the hood Ubuntu will still be using well the rest of Gnome.  Unity is going to be the interface by default for Ubuntu, for a very long time I expect, unless loads of users don't like it or something.
 macross: ok has your Unity froozen?
 Raikia: not sure if it's up yet, but there was something about being able to try Ubuntu 11.04 with Unity 2D in a web browser, on the Ubuntu site
 Raikia: in certain ways 10.10 is better, in certain waysi it's worse, and even in certain ways other dsitro's are better, but well this really does depend on the user
 gsr: Raikia by the way not really a good idea to try upgrading to 11.04 right now,  the repo's are apparnatly slow
 gsr:  Raikia since release day
 Starminn: you can get to Ubuntu Classic from the log in screen, and set as default, but of interest why do you want that?
 Stameni: once you got Classic set as default, you can have auto log in set up, and should go into that by default :)
 koistinen: you can add other app icons on it, and that's about it I think, unless you use the compiz settings,  but yes in general it's rather uncoustomiable at the moment
 Luke_: is that a new card or?
 Luke_: well not sure if there are stil quite a few issues with the propritary Nivida drivers resulting in Unity crashing, in 11.04 or not, but if so,  you could install, and then remove the propritary driver, and try the experimental I guess.
 Ziber: I think you eman 10.04 LTS?
 Ziber: if your on 9.04 still that's not supported anymore
 sadly
 Tora1188: no don't think so
 Tora1188: also the Gnome 2 wall papers, do work in Unity, because it's on top of Gnome 2 still for 11.04
 !ask | leagris
 Witchsong_: no don't think so
 Witchsong_: you can run Spotify in Wine though
 !details | escott
 aravinda: well persoanlly I woudn't give Unity to a business at this time :)
 Tetsuo55: mpc chan?
 asmogator:  if I was running a business I would  more likely give them Gnome Shell http://gnome3.org ,but I think for now Gnome 2 and KDE and such, would be more suitable, and for quite a while yet really
 galamar: Which version is your curren install?
 !upgrade | galamar
 galamar: trying to upgrade now would probably be pretty slow by the way
 iksik: you can change to Ubuntu Classic Desktop from the log in screen, and set as default even :)
 plustax: 10.04 or 10.10 ?
 iksik: Ubuntu Classic Desktop can use the global menu as well,  I don't think it's default though, well it may be
 !language | galamar
 !upgrade | galamar
 galamar: and upgrading now will probably be slow
 iksik: on the top right, in the menu there, in Unity
 koistinen: indeed
 koistinen: ,but sadly even Gnome Shell has done that, but that feature is probably coming for Gnome 3.2 :)  the next one in about six months, yay nice :)
 buco: log out, and select what you want on log in screen
 trijntje: yeah not really a good idea to cancel the upgrade once you started
 trijntje: installing stuff
 plustax: yep got to go through 10.10 to get 11.04
 plustax: you can upgrade to it, but  right now probably not the best time, repo's are probably pretty slow
 plustax: also by default 10.04 only shows Long Term Support releases
 plustax: by default LTS's only show other LTS's
 !upgrade | plustax
 plustax: and in certain ways, you may find 10.04 better, so not sure if they got the try 11.04 online thing in a web browser up yet, but yeah that for example is a way to try 11.04
 iksik: developmetn versions of 11.04 with Ubuntu Classic Desktop had the global menu, but I  think since then they removed it, but you may be able to add from the repo or something, if it's not there by default
 alex13: jsebean which graphics card?
 plustax: through 10.10
 !upgrade | plustax
 cybrhuman: depends on the user, but for me from a previous version of Ubuntu, uhmm no not really
 plustax: system  > administration > update maanger
 MarkSS: try Gnome Shell I guess then or something :)
 MarkSS: ah right I see
 MarkSS: well does this look better going by the videos?   http://gnome3.org
 plustax: you may have to enable the upgrade for 10.10.  keep it in the channel,  there are other people who should be able to help you better than I :)
 plustax: it should show in upgrade manager, but if not, uhmm probably in there some where to get it showing or something
 plustax: maybe you should just stay on 10.04,  10.10 and 11.04 don't really offer that much  proper advantage, well in my opinion :)
 plustax: plus 10.04 is Long Term Support :)
 ThomasUK: :D
 Somelauw: I have mixed feelings over Unity :D
 sgaap: and yeah indeeed Gnome  Shell :)  when it works, and Unity okish when it works
 epyx: probably not just you :)
 ssfdre38: mainly Canonica's design team people
 Ahmuck: ok I can give you a proper lnk for getting Unity working in Virtualbox :)
 Ahmuck: yes it needs to be done right, or it won't work
 Ahmuck: also you need some sort of hardwae accelleration on the host it seems, ok going to get you the link
 Adis45: the new default interface for 11.04
 Ahmuck: so if for example you got Comipz working on the host, then you got the hardware acceleration :)
 Ahmuck: ok let's get you the link :)
 Ahmuck: Do this and should work, not tired myself yet. http://www.theopensourcerer.com/2011/04/21/ubuntu-natty-in-virtualbox-with-unity/
 http://www.theopensourcerer.com/2011/04/21/ubuntu-natty-in-virtualbox-with-unity/
 Coty91: well that's actsaully the goal of Canonical now, to compete more properly against the Mac OS X interface
 ohsix: no I just read stuff about Linux distro's and so on here and there, so I know things :)
 ohsix: depends where I  read something
 ohsix: if  it was for example the offical blogs from Mark Shuttleworth or  Canonical Design team, which for my Mac OS X comment, if I remember correctly it indeed was, then sure I know something :)
 ThomasUK: heh?
 ThomasUK: it's a bit disapointing in a way no where near 2000 people this time round
 ThomasUK: (unless we use you know uhmm rounded numbers.  since that way over 1500 so it is)
 macrossm: yep  that's the plan for Canonical now to compete more against Mac OS X's interface.  anyway you may prefer Gnome Shell http://gnome3.org :)
 ohsix: you know what, if I  really wanted, to I could find the blog post,  that said they are competing agasint Mac OS X more,  but I am not sad enough to go and do that :)
 ohsix: lol at people like you
 ohsix: go try some other distro's lol
 anyway TV time bye
 kzman: through 10.10, and it will be a bit slow at the moment
 it seems
 !upgrade | kzman
 kzman: and since 10.04 is LTS it will only show LTS's by default
 rcmaehl_rant: Ambiance
 chilipep4: ok with Unity in 11.04?
 likki: since 10.04 only shows other LTS's by default, but yeah there isn't one
 likki: you can change the setting so it will show 10.10 as well, then go through that to 11.04
 chilipep4: clean install or?
 ah yes thsi channel and the attacks!
 likki: look around for  the setting I guess
 !upgrade | likki
 likki: also trying to upgrade to 10.10 and such now would be slow
 probably
 chilipep4: hmm maybe give 11.04 a try, or some other distro :D
 mala85: ok you awnt Gnome Shell :)
 want
 mala85: you don't quite get the proper expereince with the Gnome 3 ppa, but if it works for you, should be good enough for now I guess
 mala85: ,but you  will probably have issues trying to load up Unity if you install it, like KNUBBIG is pointing out
 !gnome3 | mala85
 mala85: http://askubuntu.com/questions/22946/how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-of-gnome-3
 mala85: no that's it now, 11.04 will only get security updates now
 mmjunaid: ok sounds like the upgrade gone wrong on you
 mala85: yes they will keep it up to date, it seems
 mala85: for the 100% full proper Gnome 3 expereince, wait untill 11.10 when it Ubuntu uses Gnome Shell,  or use another dsitro that has full Gnome 3 by default, but like I said if the ppa works for you, should be good enough for now really
 mala85: when Ubuntu uses Gnome 3 on the backend, I mean above, I typed wrong thing
 mmjunaid: clean install Ubuntu I guess
 mmjunaid: or maybe simpalley  Grub is pointing to the wrong partition
 !grub2 | mmjunaid
 mmjunaid: I don't really know about configuring Grub 2 that much,  you may be better off re installing with 11.04, yep a clean install
 !home | mmjunaid
 mmjunaid: you would still have to re install the programs though
 mmjunaid: right, and neither of you may like the Unity interface much that is in 11.04
 mmjunaid: for example
 erik333: well yeah it was made for netbooks only to begin with
 Quasi_: ok yeah, and does Unity freeze on you as well?
 Quasi_: than fan issue is probably something else, hardware issue or whatever
 Quasi_: altough I guess a quick test, could be to log out now,  get the log in screen, open up Ubuntu Classic Desktop, and see if the fan is ok then
 !upgrade | fuzzybunny69y
 Quasi_:  and what card you got?
 graphics
 Quasi_: ok and so the propritary driver it says isn't installed?  or it is installed, but not activated?
 Quasi_: yeah I had this kind of stuff with beta 2, but
 Quasi_: in my case Unity would freeze if the propritary driver was used, but if I removed the propritary driver and installed the experimental 3D driver, Unity would work
 Quasi_: so if you try the experimental 3D driver, things may work better for you
 !pm > Quasi_
 Quasi_: I assume this is the same Beta 2 and the final, so  going by what I ddi with Beta 2.  got to remove the propritary driver,  in additional drivers yeah,  and then after you done that may have to re boot the computer first, but should then have an option for an experimental 3D driver showing that you can then install
 Quasi_: and hold on
 Quasi_: and if you do this, and for some odd reason, you find that Unity is completly broken
 Quasi_: log into Ubuntu Classic Mode (no effects)  and install the propritary driver again I guess
 Quasi_: from the log in screen
 Quasi_: Unity didn't brake when I did what I am saying, it got it working for me, but something different may happen for you
 asteriskmonkey1: http://askubuntu.com/questions/22946/how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-of-gnome-3
 !gnome3 | asteriskmonkey1
 http://askubuntu.com/questions/22946/how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-of-gnome-3 :)
 jiga: no don't think so
 daniel: try K3B I guess
 soreau: in Unity or   Ubuntu Classic Desktop?
 soreau: I think Canonial have set it up like that or something
 soreau: they want you to use the Gnome 2 patches
 soreau: a bug or feature I guess
 soreau: I think they have linked it together much more than it was before,  altough only tried that in beta 2, not the 11.04 final yet
 soreau: it may not be like 10.04, where you can remove some of the stuff, without removing all of it
 soreau: oh what a lovely attitude you have for this channel
 soreau: I thik it's meant to, like I said before,  Canonical want you to use that stuff
 soreau: you may be able to remove an applet for it, but  something tells me, it's not as customisable as before
 multipass: you can use Gnome Shell in 11.04 :)
 shane4ubuntu: ok
 shane4ubuntu: ok by the looks of it, that's for Ubuntu Classic Desktop not Unity
 shane4ubuntu: and it does say how to install using the ppa's
 shane4ubuntu: also really what they are telling you, that you can install, is a load of junk
 stbain1: well the shut down on top right, and envelope is also in Unity, but that's in classic by default, and what is mentioned there, none of that comes with 11.04
 shane4ubuntu: ^
 shane4ubuntu: there's loads of junk you can add to Ubuntu, and that site useually tells people about it
 superproxy: depends on the computer, should be about 20  minutes to half an hour on most
 superproxy: well run the commands they give, and it should add to Unity or Ubuntu Classic I guess
 Herbs: heh in a way
 Daekdroom: yes
 Daekdroom: ISO should  have the same code, as the mirror/webpage
 jorgp: yes it does if set up right
 escott: jorgp no you don't just install the guest additions for it either,  hold on i'll get a proper link or two
 escott: jorgp a proper link
 jorgp: What's your host OS by the way?
 jorgp: ok well follow these instructions and it should work I guess:  http://www.theopensourcerer.com/2011/04/21/ubuntu-natty-in-virtualbox-with-unity/
 http://www.theopensourcerer.com/2011/04/21/ubuntu-natty-in-virtualbox-with-unity/
 jorgp: ok sure good luck with that,  and I hope you try out quite a few distro's in vm :)
 jorgp: ok :)
 !!de
 !bot | teknowill
 !imfo celementine
 xion56: try clementine yeah the name of that fruit :D
 xion56: there's a music player called that, and it's pretty good
 xsinick_laptop: Is what how Ubuntu will be from now on?
 heyguise: or the Gnome ppa or something :D
 uh competly wrong one
 bitplane: or the Gnome 3 ppa or something
 jorgp: ok awesome :) and your welcome
 jorgp: and yeah this is a great way to try out Unity, since don't need to put Ubuntu on real hardware as a result :)
 xsinick_laptop: the people who run this channel, don't like people complaining about Unity in here
 xsinick_laptop: however loads of good atlerantives.  Gnome Shell the proper interface for Gnome 3, and so on :)
 bitplane: yeah indeed I know
 bitplane: and I don't like Unity much myself really, but still what I just said
 xsinick_laptop: yep indeed I know, but well should be a good thing for other desktop envrionments and other distro's, so not that big a deal really :)
 xsinick_laptop: we are getting a bit off topic here, but really that's what Ubuntu is now, a first stepping stone distro for many people straight from Windows or Mac OS X, and many will move on to another distro later on :)  Linux Mint would be another example lf this.   at the end of the day, they are all Destkop Linux though, and that's wht I care about :)
 NictraSavios: no it's not for everyone, but uhmm well me,  you,  jorgp and xsinick_laptop and anyone else who wants to continue this subject, we should move in that case to #ubuntu-offtopic or IdleOne may tell us off
 bitplane: #ubuntu-offtopic if you want to continue the convo :)
 nathan1111: yes
 nathan1111: switch to Ubuntu Classic Desktop from the log in screen that's one way to get rid of it.  Why do you want to of interest?
 nathan1111: ok well do what I said then :)
 nathan1111: and you can set classic Desktop as default as well
 nathan1111: ok your welcome :)
 nathan1111: sudo apt-get install chromium it's the open source version that Chrome is based on
 nathan1111: chromium-browser even ah yes, ty IdleOne forgot about that,  chromium would install a game
 elijah: not without a clean install
 !home | elijah
 fringe_boss: casey  Grub and LILO, but hardly anyone uses LILO anymore
 casey: indeed,  hardly any distro's do LILO by default anymore, which also means hardly anyone knows LILO
 casey: some distro's still using the old nice old version of Grub, but later versions of Ubuntu that Grub 2 thing hmm
 !grub2 | casey
 casey: no, but i t just be an upgrade that went wrong
 carandraug: ,but it could just be an upgrad that went wrong
 casey: ^
 casey: if you can't  boot up 11.04 after upgrading to it, maybe recovery mode from the boot loader can help some how, or just clean install
 casey: well when it comes to re installing Linux distro's haveing a seperate /home really does help useually :)
 casey: however in the case of Ubuntu,  I have always set that up on the install of Ubuntu, never afterwoulds, which is also possible
 fringe_boss: oh BLURG?
 fringe_boss: there's one based on Grub 2,  that omgubuntu go on about sometimes,  Blurg I think
 casey: Blurg isn't reallyf or newbies, it's a new project, based on Grub 2,  so people can theme Grub better and such
 casey: and things can mess up if you do it wrong or whatever
 casey: stick with Grub
 casey: other boot loaders are quite pointless useualy now days
 !downgrade | Sirkill
 Sirkill: so yep clean install is  how really
 Sirkill: ok :)
 Sirkill: yep Firefox 4 is default in 11.04
 Sirkill: http://www.theopensourcerer.com/2011/04/21/ubuntu-natty-in-virtualbox-with-unity/
 Sirkill: v
 Sirkill: well make a new vm of 1.10 then I guess?
 !ask | haroon
 Barsuk: Unity goes on top of Gnome 2.  and Ubuntu Classic Desktop /  Gnome 2 with the Ubuntu specific stuff, is there as well.

 Barsuk: turn on gnome?
 Barsuk: ok so you got Unity showing?
 Barsuk: log out, and select Ubuntu Classic Desktop from the log in screen
 Barsuk: set it as default even :)
 !details | AlbertoP
 AlbertoP: ok is that a new card or?
 AlbertoP: is a propritary driver installed?
 AlbertoP: also your card may be to new for Unity
 AlbertoP: well the 3D version of it, Unity 2D well of course not
 AlbertoP: ok so it says the driver is installed, but not activiated? in additional drivers?
 AlbertoP: in general Linux distro's work best with not to old, and not to new hardware
 AlbertoP: and you get an error message when trying to load Unity?
 AlbertoP: ok if you remove the propritary driver,  an experimetnal 3D driver is probablay available and it may work with that.  or just use Unity 2D or Gnome Shell from the ppa instead or something :)
 !gnome3 | AlbertoP
 !unity  | AlbertoP
 AlbertoP: thought Unity factoid might have mentioned 2D version, hadn't seen it yet
 truepurple: no probably can't really help you much
 truepurple: here,  #ubuntu-beginners or ubuntuforums
 !anyone | plustax__
 plustax__: oh nevermind you already had
 truepurple: except ATI issues,  sure they can be complex to sort out, but they are a common problem beginners get as well with Ubuntu
 wow very lacking the 11.04 repo's for Identica/Twitter clients it seems!

 kallisti5: no Unity will stay the default for a long time
 thevishy: for some users yes, for other users no
 thevishy: altough it seems quite a lot aren't that happy with the new Unity interface in 11.04 for example
 thevishy: you should be able to try from the Ubuntu website now
 the Unity 2D
 in a web browser
 fi103910: I guess upgrading broke your booting,  may just be some issue with Grub 2, but Grub 2 isn't that easy to configure, espesaily as a newbie
 !grub2 | fi103910
 fi103910: ok so it boots up with an older kernel?
 roasted: no don't think so
 roasted: altough to be honest  not that sure what bug your reffering to, but I guess since 11.04 is security updates only, no is the answer to your question
 Kruptein: why upgrade the kernel manually? oh and espesaily why to a release candidate?
 roasted: I think that's something that won't be fixed untill maybe the next release, for what your reffering to
 roasted: well 11.04 is security updates only as far as I know, so don't expect any Unity fixes in it
 Kruptein: well don't upgrade to a releae candiate of the next one, and you shoudn't need to install another kernel yourselfl ike that
 roasted: well that's not how Ubuntu works, a release comes out, and useually only gets security updates after woulds
 coz_: roasted they will continue work on Unity for 11.10 yes, but don't expect those changes to end up in Unity in 11.04
 roasted: well Ubuntu isn't a rolling release like....  well there are people here who don't like other distro's being mentioned in here,  but one does come to mind, when it comes to getting security updates, but also proper later versions of programs when stable enough.
 roasted: of course as far as I  know Unity is pretty much Ubuntu only at the moment though, because of certain technical reasons
 roasted: no it will probably remain a versions distro, that only tends to get security updates, for well many years to come yet
 roasted: well  a guy from Fedora tried to do just that and even get it into the main repo's, and another guy tried to provide it for OpenSuse, but yep some technical issues.  Anyway this is going off topic now.
