 I think i screwed up big time
 i just updated to 11.04; turned on desktop cube and now have no panel and no way to access terminal
 >_<
 alt+F2 will not work
 nothing salt >_<
 any other way to start terminal but alt+F2 or ctrl+alt+t ?
 atm i have no panels, no windo boarders apparently no way to access terminal >_<
 atm i have no panels, no windo boarders apparently no way to access terminal >_< anyone?
 what Q?
 step21; what Q?
 step21; you mean recovery?
 step21; i can try, but then i won't be on here.... what do i do once i'm there?
 i can boot recovery, not sure what classic is
 step21; basically the programs that open at startup work; email, chat, i turned on FF via a link in an e-mail
 i can do the shift+ctrl+F2 thing
 no, i log in normally (log in screen; enter user then pass) step21... that part is fine. alt+F2 does nothing
 step21; what's classic?
 step21; ty, i'll try
 gotta restart
 okay, so I managed to get terminal working... now how do I restore the panel the way it was in 11.04?
 anyone know how to restore the panel in 11.04?
 back again
 anyone know how to restore the panel on 11.04?
 bloublou; i doubt it.. i killed it by activating desktop cube in compiz
 also, my emerald won't work -_-; I'm stuck with no window boarders (close button, etc)
 suburjan; you type in your user name, click okay then at the bottom it will show up
 threw me for a loop as well
 so, anyone know how to restore panel?
 and how to get emerald to come back >_>
 that idk; was just telling you that the options don't pop up until you type in your usr name
 sry
 anyone know if there's a way to *down*grade from 11 to 10?
 too bad
 was hoping to keep all my other mods neckoox >_<
 so no way to return the panel?
 ... and here i was happy i got to go to 11.04 without having to redo all the settings
 cane; mine worked fine until i wanted the stupid cube back -_-;
 what's that?
 neckoox; yes... I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 ... in CCSM i tried to enable cube again, gave me an error but (stupidly, i know) I figured it was one of the ever-present 'the shortcut for X is same as shortcut for Y' things and okayed it
 next thing i know, no panel up top, no window boarders
 so now no cube and no panel
 LAcan; if that's compiz settings manager i have it; it's how I screwed up the install in the first places
 place*
 LAcan; i turned on cube in CCSM and my panel (the shiny new one in 11.04) and window boarders ran away in mutiny
 what's the command line to open CCSM?
 n/m
 okay, what's this unity shell thing?
 anyone know what's this unity shell thing?
 is*
 yay, that fixed it
 ^_^
 or so i thing
 think*
