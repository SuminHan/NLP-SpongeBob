 Can I ask a question that you all must have heard a million times already?
 Has anyone here managed to get Ubuntu to network with windows 7?
 Solo: I installed it, but I'm stuck in the PW authentication loop
 solofight: my W7 network shows up on my Ubuntu 10.10 netbook, but it won't let me log in. I'm sure you've heard of this prob before
 Anyone here, please...is there a solution to the problem of loging into a Windows 7 network?
 ubottu: ok thanks
