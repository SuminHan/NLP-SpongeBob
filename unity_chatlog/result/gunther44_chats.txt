 hi, i'm having a weird problem while compiling that google isn't much help with:
 cc: error trying to exec 'cc1': execvp: No such file or directory
 how can i resolve this? i've no idea what cc1 is supposed to be
 Stereocaulon: i take it you of course can help me though despite not overlooking a shoddy copy/paste job
 Stereocaulon: cc hello.c where the file is #include <stdio.h> int main(){print "hello";return 0;}
 Stereocaulon: sorry about the downtime, isp playing up
 Stereocaulon: well, i'm actually trying to compile android, but compilation fails with the same error
 Stereocaulon: google suggests that gcc is broken somehow, but i've reinstalled it to no avail
 Stereocaulon: sure
 guntbert: crap :( i thought reinstallation was the magical fix ;)
 dd214: well... i'd like to yeah, but atm, i'm trying to compile android itself
 Stereocaulon: that's so last year - check the offtopic room!
 argh! "E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)"
 i can't build anything, my make system is extremely broken
 shcherbak: thanks, just done it, and still the same error
