 Guys, to download the new Ubuntu torrent, is it "ubuntu-11.04-alternate-i386.iso.torrent" or "ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent"?
 My computer is desktop, 32 bit, I use Alternate? ok
 thanks!
 I want to do a fresh Install
 I use Desktop then?
 ok
 sudo problem :P
 Today I installed Ubuntu 11.04 and I got this error: "It seems you don't have the necessary hardware to run Unity, choose the classic Ubuntu"
 My computer is a Pentium 4, @2Ghz, 1GB ram, with 128MB video, what's going on??
 @BINOX, really??
 No way, dude!!
 So I can't have Unity then?
 ok, I look that up in the Software center, Ubottu??
 Alright.
 I had no idea I was gonna face this problem, but I did notice that when I put the LIVE CD in and let it run I didn't see the Side bar that everybody is talking about. This Ubuntu 11.04 looks pretty much exactly like 10.04 to me. Dang!
 Need a new computer. :S
 !
 Guys, wasn't Unity originally made for Netbooks?
 If it can run in Netbooks, why doens't it run in my Desktop computer?
 Pentium 4, @2Ghz, 1GB ram
 It says I have to use Ubuntu classic
 My video card is very old, yes, it's 128MB, I never needed proprietery drives
 But then Netbooks are more powerful than my computer?
 Let me check...
 My video card is an ATI RAdeon 9250
 I clicked Additional Drivers, it says "No propriety drivers are in use"
 Ok, besides Unity, what's best about Ubuntu 11.04?
 Asking me? No listed drivers
 I made Unity in Ubuntu 11.04 work!! I don't know how but it works now!
 Pentium 4, @2Ghz, 1GB ram, 128MB ATI radeon 9250 >> Unity works very nice!
 hello
 Guys, in Unity, in the "Files and Folders" thing, it says "Search files and folders" but it doesn't actually look for anything./
 I've tried looking for something and it only opens my most recent files..
 You press the Windows key, you get this black black background thing, you try to search for a file, no searching at all!
 "Search files and folders" why doesn't it worjk?
 hello
 Guys, in Banshee, does "importing your videos" copy everything into a different folder?
 what does it do?
 The Banshee "import" option, does it copy media files into a different folder? anybody?
 Zizban, I don't think so either, but I just wanna make sure before I click on "Import"
 I'm running out of space on my computer
 I'll choose the option, then. : )
 Yup! everything's ok!
 Great!
