 guys, how much performance is lost when you upgrade to natty? Rather than just installing a fresh new system
 I'm kind of rather just surprised at some of the speeds
 performance is a little low
 maybe it's only because there is so much compiz involved
 I see, thanks guys, I'll keep looking around
 hey guys, I've googled this question and everything but is there any way to install gnome 3 without screwing up my unity 2d/3d installation?
 why not?
 i have all my stuff backed up
 didn't you like gnome 3 over unity tho?
 lol
 I have a radeon x300
 was wondering if gnome 3 will run faster or unity
 the whole concept of going on the sidebar to change windows is such an annoyance
 I don't want to get used to ineffeciency
 fuck it, i'll install gnome 3, if I don't like it, I'll go back to gnome 2 since unity will be broken
