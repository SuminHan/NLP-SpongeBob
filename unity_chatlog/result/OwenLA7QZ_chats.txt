 Hi. Anyone know how to set Adobe Reader as default app for PDF files? Works OK with double click in filemanager, but Chromium and calibre still open PDF's in Evince.
 stefg already did that
 That's why it works from fileman
 stefg: sudo update-alternatives --config x-pdf-reader (This is Navigatrix, branch of 10.04?)
 stefg, I get: update-alternatives: error: no alternatives for x-pdf-reader.

 stefg. Most stuff for ubuntu works fine (everything in Package Manager), but this one has me stumped.
