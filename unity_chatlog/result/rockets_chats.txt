 Through messing with my system too much in 11.04, I managed to lose my clock
 Any ideas how I can get it back?
 E.g. there is no clock in the upper right of my screen. I'm using the unity desktop
 Nobody makes you use unity, just pick the ubuntu classic desktop and stfu
 jbag, thanks, I managed to remove that package, but clicking on it opened up its page in ubuntu software center <3
 aphexcoil, I know, I was talking to uRock mainly
 aphexcoil, but I agree that that sort of defeats the purpose of unity dude.
 jbag, I don't see that option now that it's installed :(
 uRock, I apologize good sir.
 Is there a way to make sure all the base install ubuntu packages are really there? I've already made sure to install ubuntu-desktop but that's not enough.
 No way to do it :(
