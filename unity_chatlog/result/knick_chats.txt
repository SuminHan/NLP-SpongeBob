 Hi guys - Just downloaded and burned ubuntu 11.04 - Tried it on 2 different Lenovo 3000 N200 notebooks but on both it won't start
 I get a mount error and get thrown into busybox
 marie: Yes it is, it was released yesterday.
 So anyone else had problems starting the live-cd of Ubuntu 11.04?
 swordz: use xrandr
 ddddddddddd: best to stay up to date
 lol
 doesnt boot for me
 I get mount errors when I try to start the live cd
 bangLUCE: use iptables to forward
 Though that iptables command must be run as root
 bangLUCE: iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port <otherport>
 bangLUCE: change -A PRE.. to -D PRE..
 bangLUCE: yup
 Vustom: when you install Ubuntu on windows (dual boot) in the installer wizard you'll receive a slider to slide the sizes of the harddisks, there you can change the partition sizes
 Vustom: It's not really 'obvious' but it shows the windows and ubuntu partition in a window and you can slide it..
 Vustom: Hmm, you might have partitioned it before? I'm not sure how to do that manually though
 Bah, i dont like the new graphical stuff in ubuntu
 annoying that menu, perhaps i need to get used to it
 How to ftp server, lol
 [TK]D-Fender: Just DL the backdoored version of proftpd to experiment with lol

 infamous: use do-release-upgrade (as root)
 infamous: you might need to install it, im not sure if it comes by default
 infamous: What version shows up with 'cat /etc/lsb-release' ?
 infamous: have you performed an 'apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade -y'  as root?
 infamous: i.e. the latest updates?
 AceKing: go to your terminal and type 'top'
 AceKing: or 'man ps'
 zap0: edit /etc/apt/sources.list
 AceKing: I'm not really happy yet with the new interface either... :
 :-( *
 AceKing: still tryin to find out how to get my buttons and icons back, and how to place new things in that annoying sidebar..
 zap0: google "apt sources.list ubuntu <yourversion>"
 AceKing: I used to have an all customized menu, with the tools i preferred and all, but that seems to have gone.. Now if I need a program I just have to type it
 Soothsayer: didn't say it was part of it, but compatible with.
 You might have to manually download it
