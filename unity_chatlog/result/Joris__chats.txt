 hi guys, i happily upgraded to 11 yesterday but now my wireless doesn't work anymore on my laptop:( it says "disabled" -- then I issue the command "iwconfig wlan0 up" (or something like that) the hardware light from my wireless card goes on -- which is good, but I still don't get any internet :(
 anyone an idea what i might try? i googled but couldn't find anything that could solve it:(
 i also tried to boot again with the live cd without success
