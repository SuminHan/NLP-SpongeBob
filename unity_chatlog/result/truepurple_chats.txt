 Is it just this quick launch and workspace stuff only?

 cdbs Ok thanks, where do I find this out though? Where did you find this out?
 I am at a stage in upgrading ubuntu where it is asking to remove some stuff. Any reason to give thought as to what it wants to remove? Why does it say "open office" stuff is no longer needed?
 ejv: So should I give it permission to remove it? Is it possible to allow it to remove some of this stuff, but not all?

 ACameron: Net install is good too,(a option under unetbootin) very small, it downloads off the internet as it installsACameron
 Is there any way to selectively choose what programs that ubuntu is going to uninstall when updating?
 zachgretzinger: Its asking for permission to remove 76 "obsolete packages" right now.
 Chaos: I have been in here for hours sometimes just trying to get someones attention, but I still never spam or shout
 zachgretzinger: I see in the list, "open office" in a number of places, that is going to uninstall open office, no?
 zachgretzinger: Do I have to worry about anything suddenly becoming uncompatible with the newer ubuntu? For example, will I be able to download updates for battle for wesnoth like normal, even if they haven't made a version for 11.04 yet?
 bazhang: Is it easy to revert back?
 zachgretzinger: So perhaps update them before updating ubuntu?
 zachgretzinger: With the update screen at "do you wish to remove these packages" will that still work? Or will I have trouble because the update is midstream?
 zachgretzinger: Are there drawbacks for 11.04 then? Besides the new quick link stuff, anything else I will appreciate with 11.04? Its alot quicker?
 zachgretzinger: Like what?
 zachgretzinger: I am a linux newbie, I am still getting use to linux in general
 zachgretzinger: A utube video isn't going to tell me much
 zachgretzinger: I tried running the get update program, but I got alot of errors about unavailable resources
  zachgretzinger: I tried running the get update program, but I got alot of errors about unavailable resources
 zachgretzinger: I tried running the get update program, but I got alot of errors about unavailable resources
 zachgretzinger: Not a single 404
 zachgretzinger: And no, I didn't get any updates
 zachgretzinger: The command didn't work
 zachgretzinger: ALT F2 doesn't do anything
 zachgretzinger: Ok, I got alt F2 to work, apparently it only works with the left alt. But as I said, that command doesn't work, it gives me that error when I do that
 zachgretzinger: It gives me those errors I mentioned about unavailable resources and such
 zachgretzinger: The errors I mentioned earlier that you said I should not mind
 zachgretzinger: I never got to a screen to choose any updates, nor did I see any download progress or install activity
 zachgretzinger: When I type that command in terminal, all it does is give me those errors
 E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
 E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
 E: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/
 E: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/
 bazhang: apt? what is that?
 zachgretzinger: Why?
 zachgretzinger: But how does putting it in a text file on my desktop help you do that?
 zachgretzinger: How about a pastebin or a PM instead? Less work, and anyway, why put it into a text file to email it to you?
 zachgretzinger: Its like 4 lines anyway
 zachgretzinger: Do you see that PM I sent you?

 milen8204: I will create a thread on this problem too and link you to it for you to contribute
 milen8204: What do you mean by preinstall? You bought a computer already like this?
 nit-wit: Are you able to help?
 milen8204:  Did you try to upgrade to 11.04?
 nit-wit: Of course you need to restart your PC when upgrading from 10.10 to 11.04
 milen8204:  And you also only see a bit of dashed lines at the top of the screen with the rest blank?
 milen8204: What do you see on your screen?

 HAKMASTER:  I don't have it on disk
 coz_:  I can not burn any disks unless it is possible to revert back to 10.10 or otherwise get ubuntu to work
 coz_: I listed it in the thread link
 coz_:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10739837#post10739837
 coz_:  With facing these strange blinking dashes, does that mean it is not installing?
 coz_:  Could it possibly be installing at the moment behind this blank screen? If it is installing at this moment, restarting could screw it up
 KrisDouglas: Well, I was having trouble with my video card drivers before updating even, I had a corrupted driver I couldn't remove, and was not sure what driver to use
 KrisDouglas: What is ssh?
 KrisDouglas: I never get to a grub screen though
 coz_:  I will try holding down shift
 coz_:  KrisDouglas  Ok, got to a grub menu, I see a "previous linux version" option, should I pick it?
 KrisDouglas: It says "It seems you do not have the hardware required to run unity. Please choose ubuntu classic at the login screen and you will be using the traditional environment"
 KrisDouglas: It didn't give me a option to choose ubuntu classic, but I loaded into a desktop, now I will see what happens if I restart
 KrisDouglas: I have only one mouse to swap between these PCs, is there a hotkey for restarting?
 KrisDouglas: Except I am using a ATI radeon 6850
 KrisDouglas: You would recommend nvadia drivers for a ATI card?
 KrisDouglas: You think a driver update could fix this problem?
 KrisDouglas: How do I remove the corrupt old driver then? Could we please speak in PM? Less work keeping track of the conversation

 It is installed, but its abilities are limited, I can not set it past 800x600, and apparently may be the reason 11.04 won't load for me

 Since I updated to 11.04, my tomboy notes program has disappeared, how do I get it back? Would the files I made with it still be around?
 n3glv: I don't understand
 n3glv: How do I do that?
 n3glv: I can't make heads or tales of what is in synaptic package manager, but I can't find any tomboy notes anyway
 n3glv: Scratch that, found it, now what?
 n3glv: Mark for reinstallation? My saved notes should still be there, right?
 n3glv: Do I select mark for reinstallation?
 n3glv: I did that, but it still doesn't seem to be installed, do I need to reload?
 n3glv: Well when I try to add it to my panel, its not listed as a option
 n3glv: I wouldn't know how to do that, how do i search for a file?
 n3glv: So ubuntu doesn't come with a file search option?
 n3glv: What is "updatedb"? So ubuntu doesn't come with a file search program?
 n3glv: You still there?

 ActionParsnip: Do what now?
 ActionParsnip: What command?
 ActionParsnip: All it says is "/usr/bin/tomboy"
 ActionParsnip: The binary?
 ActionParsnip: What do you mean by binary?
 ActionParsnip: Does ubuntu not have a built in feature for finding a file on either ones hard drive, or the page they are lookng at?
 ActionParsnip: Something like windows search command, and/or like a browsers or text files find a particular word on this page command.
 ActionParsnip: Built into ubuntu?
 ActionParsnip: Doesn't ubuntu come with any of its own search functions?
 ActionParsnip: Where is it then?
 ActionParsnip: Ok thanks, on to my next subject, getting a good ATI driver for my 6850, can you help?
 ActionParsnip: I don't know what you mean by "check the hardware app"
 ActionParsnip: I have already done a bunch of research on this subject and what about system-> administration?
 ActionParsnip: What new info?
 ActionParsnip: What about system adminstration?
 ActionParsnip: You mean additional drivers? That is only one possible driver to use, I want to explore other driver options
 ActionParsnip: There is like at least 3 different options for drivers to use, and I'd like to know which to use, where would be a good place to go?
 Anyone know which ATI drivers are the best to use?
 ActionParsnip: Ok, so which solutions are good for what kind of things?
 ActionParsnip: Or put another way, what are the pros and cons of the different driver options?
 rgr: What wiki?
 ActionParsnip: the proprietary is the one you download off the ATI website?
 ActionParsnip: But those aren't as up to date as what I would get off ATIs website, right?
 ActionParsnip: What do you have against ATI?
 ActionParsnip: Well I've heard of issues with both, and asked about nvdia and ATI regarding linux here before, and was told ATI was good for linux
 ActionParsnip: Main reason I went radeon is that it is more efficient for your performance energy wize then radeon
 rgr: I have no idea, I ask for advice, and am given it, I don't usually know the credentials of the people who give out advice
 rgr: Who told me what? That radeon is more efficient? I learned it myself from looking at many many reviews
 rgr I did use SE, but it didn't come up with anything definitive
 rgr: No, a desktop I put together myself
 rsr: There are pleny of clueless websites and blind leads and dead search ends online too, but I got to go somewhere for information

 bitplane: I need to know which driver option is best for a radeon 6850
 bitplane: I can install through a terminal command, additional drivers, or download the driver off of ATIs site
 bitplane: Notification in notification bar? What do you mean?
 bitplane: Do you use 11.04?
 bitplane: Try what first? My card was already in my system before I installed ubuntu

 bitplane: What do you think about using the closed source drivers instead?
 bitplane: And how do I go about installing them?
 bitplane: Is that what is called "duel head"?
 cardamon: Fine, is that what they mean by dual head?
 bitplane: But multiple head means multiple monitors, not cards?
 bitplane: So "head" means monitor, not card?
 bitplane: What is the method of installing the open source version of the drivers? Through a terminal command?

 izinucs: What FS would you recommend for both files that both linux and windows would use?
 izinucs: But win7 recognizes ext3?
 izinucs: But you think that is a better option then fat or NTSF?
 izinucs: Shared partition, Linux and windows will both have their own partition aside from this one
 izinucs: Duel boot
 izinucs: A partition for linux, a partition for windows, a partition for VM for linux and windows perhaps, finally a main partition for "files"
 izinucs: May we please speak in PM so I can keep track of this conversation better?
 izinucs: hmm, it doesn't seem to work
