 does anyone know how to edit file associations
 I need to permanently and completely remove all references to one
 particularly, after I upgraded to 11.04, SOMEHOW my system did something retarded
 and now whenever something attempts to open a folder, it opens WITH VLC
 so load old style gnome
 places->Home Folder
 my home folder opens in VLC
 I cannot find the configuration file contaning this
 crap
 I upgraded to 11.04 and I went from 16 virtual desktops to 4
 what the hell?
 this is screwing with my spatial orientation
 tensorpudding:  yeah I was using compiz, now I'm on Unity
 tensorpudding:  oh, EVERYTHING broke on the upgrade
 and then I tried installing gnome3 ppa to get Gnome-shell, and had to reinstall ubuntu
 tensorpudding:  the stupidest thing was immediately after upgrading (before trying to get gnome-shell), I couldn't open folders
 anything that accessed an inode/directory opened it with vlc
 so if I hit "Home Folder," VLC opened.
 etc
 I found in ~/.local/ blahblahblah there was a file that contained "Deleted associations" that had that
 and it used it, even though it was a deleted association
 because it was "deleted," no interface exposed it to me; I had to find the configuration file and remove the line
 @_@
 zzecool:  clean install wouldn't have fixed that; that was in my /home directory
 zzecool: so I fixed that, and then did a clean install
 zzecool:  and then found ALL MY DATA was gone and -- oh, it mounted /home subvol=@home, the heck is this?  ... modified fstab and got all my files back.
 zzecool:  I have 500 gigs in /home, what the hell do I back up to?
 zzecool:  it's on a separate partition, as well.
 anyway
 I danced around the issue, it works now, other than Unity being not total crap, but not great.
 zzecool:  no, I didn't love it in the 90s and I don't love it now.
 zzecool: replace the Ubuntu icon in the top left with a black and white Apple icon
 zzecool:  welcome to MacOS6
 who decided that menus belong at the top of the screen, instead of the top of the window
 zzecool:  I know.  I'm toying with Unity so that when Gnome3 is available and I switch to Gnome shell I can claim I've used Unity extensively.  The initial shock is wayning.  I've toyed with gnome-shell though.
