 tdn, #Ubuntu+1 is probably better for that question.
 oh. Sorry.
 oh! It's release day :)
 I'm moving house so I had completely forgotten! That's a first...
 shane4ubuntu, yes, I've been using it for a while, so... The release isn't that important to me. But this is offtopic. Sorry.
 proq, Unity uses Compiz.
 werever, the desktop  cd can't be used as a local archive like the alternate cd can. It uses other techniques to install the system very quickly, but that isn't compatible with apt.
 werever, or directly from the servers?
 Emasarn, if you have a PC with 2-3GB RAM, then 32bit is the best one. If you have more RAM, or expect to have more RAM in the future, you need the 64bit one.
 somethingelse, sure. There are many improvements to be made. I expect that's why they wanted to introduce it in this release, so they have another normal release to polish before the next LTS cycle.
 werever, no. Look in your archive settings and maybe remove it. You do have an installed system, yes?
 Emasarn, ah. No, forget that. It works well on both.
 Emasarn, it's just that Intel had some strange ideas back in the days.
 nutsfornatty, yes, you do. I got used to it very quickly though, and I'll never look back. But there are still improvements to be made.
 werever, ok. I'm not sure why it'
 werever, why it'd ask for CD then. But you can configure which sources to use. It's in System > Administration > Software Sources.
 somethingelse, you're arguing about shells? They'll all be available in 11.10. It's not possible to provide gnome shell yet, for purely technical reasons, but we'll get there. And they'll have different strengths.
 galamar, you don't need to. Press alt, click anywhere in the window and drag it around. :)
 somethingelse, there are. But what are you talking about? The classic ubuntu desktop experience is installed by default in 11.04. Just choose it from the login screen.
 somethingelse, oh. Sorry. I should've seen that. Are you using Unity?
 Raikia, 10.10 will be supported for quite a while, so if you're not in a hurry, don't feel pressured. :)
 macross, takes 5 seconds to switch back in the login screen.
 macross, take this somewhere else. This is very offtopic for this channel.
 Stameni, very small.
 Stameni, the appindicators have been improved and such. Default apps have obviously changed in classic ubuntu as well, but other than that, not much.
 tdn, there is no more netbook version. There is only ubuntu and ubuntu server.
 Stameni, you just choose it whenever you login. It's at the bottom of the screen after you've selected your user.
 tdn, URL please? Keep in mind that there are more releases alive. 10.04 and 10.10 will be available for quite a while. Those do have netbook editions.
 Wickedspawn, I'm using xchat from the repos. If that's 2.8.8, I am. But that's not a useful question. I'm going away now and I have no idea what you really wanted to ask.
 aravinda, it doesn't hurt to wait. If you depend on it, I think a golden rule is to upgrade when you need to. Think why instead of why not.
 Superstar, moved?
 Superstar, no, and I don't think that's going to happen, unless we get a portrait mode. But that'd  almost certainly include other stuff as well.
 cyoz1, Fedora is really good, as long as you don't need anything proprietary. It's a very nice distro.
 sebsebseb, what he said, was that we should aim for OS Xs smoothness and user friendlyness. I agree. I think we've far surpassed Windows' in that area. We need to keep raising our standards.
 thegoodcushion, I use 10.04LTS on my desktop. It's very stable and I'm going to use it until may-june 2012.
 thegoodcushion, Classic Ubuntu in 11.04 uses gnome-panel. It's just a matter of choosing the session once. It takes about 3 seconds.
 you can add sortcuts to the dash by adding .desktop-files to /usr/share/applications, but is there a personal way to do it? That is, to add .desktop-files to a folder in your home and make them appear in your dash?
 freeman_, pardon?
