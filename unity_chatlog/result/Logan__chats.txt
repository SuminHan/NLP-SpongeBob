 Ooh, that factoid needs to be updated.
 deneb: The Gnome 3 PPA is not supported here.
 (if I'm not mistaken)
 mello: No need to install - just choose the Ubuntu Classic environment at login.

 !vmware | joako
 joako: /join #vmware for support
 mello: Lubuntu is a distro with LXDE based on Ubuntu, but it's not officially supported by Canonical
 shrys: it shouldn't, unless the devs haven't provided newer versions for natty
 Grimdin: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
 Grimdin: That will let you change all the visual effects in Ubuntu Classic
 (and Unity, for that matteR)

 harushimo: Python 2.7 wasn't built to work on Natty, or the other way around.

 harushimo: You can build from source, but that's not really recommended.
 harushimo: I found a PPA, if you want to try it out: https://launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/deadsnakes
 nbf: I hope you didn't run that command...
 Jahooty: It is currently impossible to put it at the bottom of the screen.  However, using ccsm, you can turn off auto-hiding.
