 In 11.04, how do i change my workspace positioning? Default has a 2x2 grid, but i would much prefer a 1x4 row.
 herb, right click what?
 herbs, im sorry, i dont understand you. If i right click the actual workspace, i can change my wallpaper - thats about it. I want to modify the amount of workspaces i have and/or the ordering/layout of them
 Herbs, the bottom right panel does not exist in 11.04
 ok, thanks anyway

 gartral, heh, but i cannot do that when 11.10 comes out, i should probably learn how to do it with unity too =)
 gartral, thats cheating
 gartral, really ?! are you sure there is no such facility?
 My god, that is beyond retarded. Remind me again why this change to unity was a great idea?

 stimpie, thank you
