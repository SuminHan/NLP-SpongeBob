 I was upgrading from 10.04 to 10.10 and just before done accidently went into reboot.
 Well, I did sudo dpkg --configure -d     then followed with sudo apt-get -d install  or something like that.   All clean....
 Now when I reboot normal,   choose 2.6.35-28 and big UBUNTU print on screen with cycling red dots under it.   3-7 seconds.  Then screen cycles  out-sync---in-sync   3x     THEN nothing more for very long time  30 minutes ?   Why wont it finish booting ?
  can boot in recovery to a login prompt.   But no gui works.   Keyboard seem disabled when starting gui then hangs only powerbutton shutdown works.
 illmortal: my keyboard does not work, so only pwr button can shutdown.
 HOW TO finish upgrading to 10.10 where the gui portion hangs ?   I can login text mode in recovery.

 Screen saver has me frozen with just a mouse arrow working.   What to try now ?
