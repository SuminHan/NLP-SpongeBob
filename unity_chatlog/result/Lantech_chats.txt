 Hello
 I've migrated a win7 install with Wubi to an SSD.  Then, I moved the wubi install to a "real" install on a partition.  Now, I'm upgrading to 11.04.
 Do I need to do any tweaks RE the SSD?
 in terms of trim support or anything?
 No?  Yes?  Maybe?  Fuck off Lantech?
 sigh
 yeah, thanks.  tell me again.
 TIL this channel sucks
