 sebsebseb: i actually tried gnome shell... didn't really care for it.. (it was a bit buggy for me).. but i did try the live CD for Open Suse, which had Gnome 3.. and it was very good.. i'm guessing when Gnome 3 PROPERLY hits ubuntu 11.10, it will be much better
 !party
 harrihu: what device is it, do you know?
 sebsebseb: really?.. i hadn't heard that, thats pretty awesome
 sebsebseb: very cool.. that takes "trying linux" to a whole new level.. don't even have to burn a cd
 sebsebseb: i kind of agree there.. i like unity, but my old laptop just couldn't handle it
 sebsebseb: didn't care for unity-2d... so i just went xubuntu.. really happy with it.. i hadn't really used xfce4.. i like it.

 !isitout
 spread the word, it's finally out!...lol
 Incarus6: i wouldn't say "always" better but there's circumstances where its better
 Incarus6: its been a long time since flash didnj't work properly w/ 64bit... it works fine now
 there: for me it was... but i'm running 11.04 on an ancient machine.. i just switched to xfce.. i knew that change would come about eventually
 Incarus6: there's no way you can make such a general statement ilke that, and it even be remotely accurate.
 surely you realize that
 velcroshooz: i don't think it was in in 10.10 either
 Psydoll: its int he repos, cuz i installed it, check your repository listing
 Toph: transmission has been a default app for... ? a while... a long while
 cholo: you should be able to.
 hsh902: it's 11.04   and it will be supported for 18mo
 Roasted: yes, its out
 Roasted: oh, 2d.. id on't think so.
 !grub | fezzik02
 kathie: it takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it's really not bad.... i chose to switch to xfce, rather than deal w/ unity any longer
 ohsix: yeah.. but i figure gnome 3 is coming out.. probably in november.. and my laptop is an old crappy one.. .i knew i'd ahve to make the switch eventually, so 11.04 was as good as any>. :)
 ohsix: dunno, the gnome 3 panel i tried, looked totally different
 kathie: i couldn't figure out how to, but you can create anothe rpanel, and add items to it... (i think).. and just set it to auto hide
 fezzik02: read the link, you have to do all that from a live cd
 fezzik02: then either your ubuntu install is gone, or you're not doing it correctly
 fezzik02: if it can't find grub to update/reinstall it.. or you're doing it wrong
 fezzik02: then you're not installing it correctly
 fezzik02: i'ev reinstalled grub from a live cd, following those instructions, a gazillion times... so i know they are right.,.
 fezzik02: have you listeneed to a word thats been said, or even bothered to read that link you were given to, like 5x?
 !grub | fezzik02 now stop asking questions, and read the link
 geez..
 !stupid | ChronicSyncope
 ChronicSyncope: :)
 fezzik02: i dunno man...
 fezzik02: so how the heck is it starting your kernel, and grub not working?
 fezzik02: so the grub install went fine, you have some other issue.
 xsinick: i do.
 ..
 stbain1: whats your device?
 tauntaun: itunes alternatives under linux aren't very good IME... i eventually just started runing xp in vbox, and syncing my ipod w/ itunes
 trihope: yup
 !de | heyguise
 heyguise: what you posted, looks like german
 ubuntu_: so how are you here now?
 Dr_Willis: why it builds querry's of course. :)
 Dr_Willis: :)
 warp_: from the ubuntu install cd?.. i don't think you can, you have to use the alt. cd
 tasslehoff: you want a gmail notifier?
 tasslehoff: you should be able to configure mail-notification, to work w/ gmail (i always use checkgmail, nt really sure on the others)
 GamingDroid: whyw ould there be?
 Datz: i believe thats just a meta package.. you'll see a lot of packages remove that
 Datz: if you're using 11.04, it should be installed by default, log out, at sign on screen, clcik your username then click "Sessions" and set it to Gnome classic
 you want what gone? unity?.. so uninstall it.. thats no tgonna effect gnome
 Datz: ok.. so don't run it?
 Datz: ok, if thats what you want to do.
 Datz: the other option is to install one of the "lighter" desktops.. depending on the specs of your machine.. xfce or lxde
 Datz: ok, well thaen thats your answer
 leoechevarria: does your machine support 3D?
 leoechevarria: dunno, that doesn't make sense
 newb_: you can... but during beta, results were very mixed... (lots of lockups, etc..) YMMV.
 escott: that was my experience... not to mention, it wasn't reliable at all.
 MustardCU1: so why are you recommending it?.. why not say yes, it can, w/ some caveats, instead of "yes, and a link"
 MustardCU1: you said yes it can, and gave him the link
 ..
 !worksforme
 newb_: again, my experience, gnome-shell broke unity, when i tried to remove gnome-shell, unity remained broken.. this was during beta, i ended up just reinstalling
 astory: you're lucky... there were several in the beta channel that ended up reinstalling when they tried to remove it...
 linuasus6: tat error is obvious, are yo on a lvie cd?
 linuasus6: did you follow the instructions to mount the drive?
 !grub2 | linuasus6: well, i wasn't paying attention, but nit-wit is competent... try reading the link to 'restore grub2 after windows"
 linuasus6: cuz it looks like you were running that command, on a drive that wasn't mounted
 greenlantern: stop
 first, gnome3, is not in Ubuntu 11.04.. read the release notes
 greenlantern: if you';re using unity, its not there
 ..
 MustardCU1: basically and "is" is totally different, i've used the gnome3 live cd.. and its a lot different from unity
 greenlantern: stop being annoying.. if you're using unity, there is no gnome panel, now go read the release notes on ubuntu.com
 greenlantern: no, it uses unity..
 Inphernal: lol, death to reading!
 greenlantern: then don't use it
 greenlantern: ..
 Maddogm: on unity?.. you install them from synaptic.. if you mean the panel applets, they don't wrk on unity, you have to be using gnome classic
 Maddogm: i think you can create a panel.. and add the panel applets to it.. but th top panel.. you won't be able to add applets to it... unless they are indicator applets
 MadRobot: Gnome is getting away from the panel applets, and moving towards indicator applets.. it's honestly not surprising...
 MadRobot: if an indicator applet is available.. msot fo the time, you install them from synaptic
 someone kick that clown
 MadRobot: nope.. just install them in synaptic, and it will get added to the indicator applet tray (up by the clock)
 MadRobot: i agree.. i always kinda liked "right clicking the panel" and adding them.
 made it simple
 MadRobot: not to mention, some of the panel applets, have not been properly implemented into indicator applets yet (like system monitor)
 MadRobot: maybe.. it'll just take some adjusting to... unity kept giving my machine issues, so i just switched to xfce, which is similar enough to ubuntu.
 classic gnome
 MadRobot: xfce4 is slick.. i like it... disable compositing, and its very fast (or if you've got a newer PC, it'll be fast w/ it)
 MadRobot: but its not as user friendly as gnome.. but i have used it before, and like it
 agbagb: what is your graphics device?
 dtulchin: depends on what you need to repair
 agbagb: i'm not sur eon that device, i kinda thought intels "just worked" w/ linux (at least mine does)
 agbagb: you can try starting the kernel w/ some variables, like maybe nomodset   or something lik,e that, see if that gets your display to work
 !nomodset
 oops
 karthick87: that would be a setting on the windows machine i imagine.. not sure you can disable it though
 newb_:
 ?
 newb_: no,, i removed it cuz it caused so many problems.. you should be able to tell the difference between unity and gnome-shell
 sebastian: probably cuz you set it to auto login
 klingan: that reaolly depends on your irc client, what are you using?
 klingan: right click on the channnel in your channel list, settings/hide join/part
 flodine, it wasn't rushed
 it's just an initial release, jsut like when kde4 was initially released, it was awful
 Lesterwood, because 11.4 doesn't exist most likely
 isarl, i strive
 kalleth2, how much ram does that system have?
 kallisti5, a lot of times, yes.. it will not default to the 2d desktop... you can use the alt. cd
 kallisti5, yeah, i did.. thank you
 kallisti5, whats your graphics device?
 kallisti5, i'm really not sure.. but as said, you can try booting into the failsafe.
 kallisti5, i'd be really surprised if that ATI device supported the 3D desktop on the live CD.
 kallisti5, yes, they are, but radeons linux support sucks.
 always has
 Cairo|Mac, i've heard a lot of complaints that the live cd will not fall back to gnome, when the 3D desktop fails to load
 itaylor57, o/
 WindowNumOne: try gnomebaker, it's alwys burned ISO's just fine for me
 WindowNumOne: if all those programs are failing, you have some other malfunction going on there
 fisix: the icon for network manager/applet, is set by the theme.
 fisix: again, it all depends on the theme...
 fisix: what is it now, unplugged ethernet cable?
 fisix: dunno man, does changing your theme change it?
 !mosue | thejonb
 !mouse | thejonb oops
 fisix: probably in your system settings, i'm not using gnome/unity anymore.. so i'm not 100% sure
 fisix: negative.. lxde
 fisix: you can install those GUI's from the repositories
 fisix: lxde.org is    but lubuntu.org   is not
 or at least i don't think it is
 calamari: i thought it was gonna have unity-2d as a fallback.. .there needs to be some sort of fall back, to many peope having probs booting 3D
 IdleOne: thanks.
 IdleOne: i was actually referring to 11.10 though
 IdleOne: i was just saying what i read
 lol
 cloud9: just download the .deb, double click and install?
 is google earth in the repos now?
 !info googleearth
 !info googleearth-package
 hmm, didn't know that
 litropy: stop
 litropy: you can /msg ubottu something here... and he'll PM you all the factoids you want (if you want to just ask it various questions)
 calamari: i can't imagine a situation where any burning utility, would need sudo.
 calamari: hmm, thats strange.. i've never had to use sudo w/ a burning utility.. sounsd like he's got more issues than not being able to burn something unless he's root
 calamari: actually...
 !gksudo | calamari
 calamari: of course, the issue becomes, if someone doesn't know how to fix it
 jetienne: if you're putting it in vbox, i would download the alternate cd ISo...... since vbox doesn't support 3D out of the box.. a lot of people had trouble using the Live ISO in vbox (during the beta, not sure if thats changed)
 maxillusionist: no, 11.04 is fina;
 l
 jetienne: as far as i know.. yes... because once you get tot he sign on screen (don't set auto login) you can choose to default to gnome classic.
 usalabs: thats not gonna help his problem, vmware player doesnt support 3D any better than vbox.
 jetienne: for now, because the live CD (at least in my experience.. and thus why so many folks are having trouble w/ live cds) doesn't default to a 2D desktop yet, if 3D desktop fails.
 jetienne: well, there's virtualbox, if your computer has the juice for it.
 jetienne: have you tried booting the live CD?
 jetienne: by doing what i said, using the alternate cd to install in vbox, then booting the 2d desktop
 jetienne: no, thats not what it means.. live cd, means booting the OS from the cd, and running it from the CD
 jetienne: yes.. 2d-  as of now, = Gnome
 kellnola: i agree.. i'm thinking when 11.10 rolls around.. it'll have a default 2D fallback again
 jetienne: why do you keep saying you need a dedicated computer?.. you don't
 skiwithpete: you need to rebuild the mbr of your machine...
 !dualboot | jetienne you don't need to dedicate a machine to ubuntu
 jetienne: no.. its not impossible, you just can't do 3D(out of the box anyway).. .big difference
 skiwithpete: no  windows mbr, is a windows mbr problem
 skiwithpete: its a utility to rebuild the MBR of windows, you were given the link above...  http://members.iinet.net.au/~herman546/p18.html#MbrFix.exe
 skiwithpete: i'm not familiar w/  freedos... but fixmbr and fixboot, are standard dos tools, so i would think so.
 skiwithpete: if you want a pretty GUI app to rebuild your MBR.. google "Easus Partition Editor"... the freeware version has a easy to use MBR rebuilder
 jetienne: no, there's links to just the ISO
 jetienne: just keep in mind, thats a completely text based installer, but since you're putting it in vbox, it won't matter, just take the defaults for everything.
 zvacet: its not difficult, but some find it more intimidating.
 jetienne: understood
 zvacet: i'm very familiar with it... and if you've been here any amount f time, there's moer than one user who did not want to use the live cd... so my point was valid.
 *alt cd
 zvacet: my point is, its not hard(i agree w/ you there)... however, a new user who knwos nothing about linux partitions, setting up their drive, etc.. it's going to be intimidating
 jetienne: you keep saying "dedicating a box to it"... maybe there's a translation thats not coming across wel.. you don't have to dedicate a box to it.. you can dual boot the machine easily.
 jetienne: dedicate implies that ubuntu would be the only OS on the computer... dual booting (between linux and windows, or various linux distros) is very easy
 !dualboot | jetienne
 jetienne: thats not really what that means... that would be a dedicated install, because the computer is stil capable of booting other OS's..
 jetienne: dedicated=only
 jetienne: well.. sorry, how you're saying it is not correct.
 jetienne: just as an example... if you were coming here asking for install help.. and you told thenm you were dedicating a machine to ubuntu.. you'd get instructions to completely wipe the drive and install only Ubuntu"... if you wanted to dual boot, you would lose windows.
 zvacet: the alt cd has been an installer for a long time.
 or did i misunderstand?
 jetienne: its not my definition of dedicated.. its the english language definition of dedicated.. there's a huge difference in what you're saying, and the word dedicated... i just didn't want them confused.
 jetienne: no, that is not correct
 that would be a dedicated install (that does not require windows to run)... as i said....
 jetienne: a dedicated machine... is a machine(ie, entire computer) that is dedicated to ubuntu.
 i don't know how much more clear i can make it
 jetienne: no i don't... i think there's a communicatino barrier here.. maybe you don't grasp what the word "dedicated" means
 jetienne: not arguing.. just telling you.. you're the one who has continued to push it.
 dn't need to argue when you're right..lol
 i actually liked the unity launcher docked.
 manu_44: you're in it.
 jetienne: well, i've got webster dictionary on my side, so im comfortable with what i've said..
 manu_44: you mean the old gnome? (like in 10.10?)
 manu_44: log out, and on "sessions" choose ubuntu classic
 ActionParsnip: i don't think he actually wants nautilus (as unity uses nautilus)... i think he wants gnome 2.2
 manu_44: and..?
 skiwithpete: yes..
 skiwithpete: ok...
 skiwithpete: answer your PM.. i don't really follow what you're saying
 phoenixsampras: unfortunately, thats a danger of any upgrade, not just Linux.. there's plenty of documentation on bricked Windows installs from upgrade fails also.
 phoenixsampras: you're lucky... i've fixed more than one bad upgrade of windows
 mikebeecham: little late to the party, but good job on the wallpapers... :)
 jheyes: upgrading always poses risks.
 jheyes: no, i just recommend you always be prepared BEFORE upgrading.. so if something happens... you won't cry for days over lost data when you have to reinstall
 jheyes: i mean if you have important data on the machine, yes, back it up befor eupgrading
 jheyes: but i do agree vibhav i always clean install.. i've not "upgraded" linux in 10yrs
 ActionParsnip: lol. it's obviously very "important"..lol
 jheyes: well, gotta use common sense.. remember, all computer problems start w/ the bozo pounding on the keys... :0
 jheyes: lubuntu right now... i might switch back to debian, but i'm kinda digging lubuntu righ tnow
 jheyes: well, it really doesn't amtter what you're upgrading, if its linux or windows, or DOS.. you shoudl always backup prior to doing it
 boot: can you providce a link?
 boot: well, i get a User ID/Password screen.. but that does little good to check the problem
 agronholm: yup, thats what i got
 you really shouldn't need medibuntu anymore, but it works just as well..
 boot: hold on
 boot: hold on a second.. jeez.. learn a little patience
 boot: has it worked previously with linux?
 sec_goat: no, it upgrades you to lubuntu 11.04

 Toiletbowl: well, unity is getting mixed reviews, but other than that.. it seems to run great to me
 milen8204: ar eyou doing it from a live cd?
 milen8204: thats your problem... you have to do that from a live cd, becuase the drive is mounted.
 milen8204: if it didn't give you information that simple, i would stronglly suspect the info on that page
 milamber: you cannot partition a drive, that is mounted.. so in order to partition it, you're going to have to boot a live cd or usb (so the drive is not mounted) and partition it from there
 milen8204: so you're doing a clean install of 11.04?
 juboba: why on earth would you want to use wubi?..
 milamber: ok.. whyd idn't you create a separate home, while installing?
 milamber: oh ok.
 so you ahve a separate /home partition (from 10.10)... but its not being used for 11.04(it has its own home).. is that right?
 milen8204: i have no idea
 TimothyA: clever, but not really for this channel
 user82: sure.
 user82: i believe its actually an optin when you install it'll ask you to 'clean install natty over a previous version of ubuntu" or something like that
 user82: you might be able to do that w/ an advanced set up, but for the "guided" part, where it does it all for you, thats probably asking to much
 yuskhanzab: to my knowledge, there's no repository w/ gyachi in it.. do ome googling, i found some instructions a long time ago to install it in 10.10.. probably still works for 11.04
 ActionParsnip: wow, hadn't seen that.;
 win
 ActionParsnip: lol, id idn't google it.. i was going off memory... i have no use for gyachi.. if he's not willing to google, i'mn ot doing it for him.
 lol
 true..
 Mali: you'll probably have to do it manually   check out Pendrivelinux
 Dcite: if you follow what he's saying, he's using arch.. unetbootin doesn't have a version of arch
 Dcite: or if it does, i don't know about it (don't really use it anymore)
 Mali: there should be a solutjion out there.. you'll probaly just have to do it manually
 Mali: yeah, if you can boot an ISO of ubuntu or mint 10.10  they both have reliable usb creation tools.. that would be a good alternative
 Mali: ok, good luck
 mbn_18: in synaptic.. go to settings/repositories.. then where it says "Select servers".. choose Find best server..
 mbn_18: actually, i think its "settings repositories, then where it says download from, choose other, then click select best server

 Pudabudigada: vlc is a mess in 11.04 right now, not sure why... i've had really good luck w/ Parole Media Player
 Mali: 11.04 is fine.. it just has some issues... but with such heavy changes, thats to be expected
 Mali: honestly, if you want ultimate stability, look at something other than unity.. you might even consider xubuntu or lubuntu or kubuntu.. just a lot of changes on the gnome side right now
 Mali: i just haven't been able to embrace gnome 3 yet (on ubuntu anyway)
 Pudabudigada: what does?
 oh, well, thats a relief
 lol
 Pudabudigada: lol

 teamviewer is deadnuts simple to use.. also avoids opening router ports, etc

 Omega: did you not follow the discussin? because it doesn't require opening router ports (which is something some people dn't know how to do, or can't do due to not being able to log in to a router)
 invisiblek: no it doesn't, you can set it to "auto log in"
 Omega: not for teamviewer.. if he has to open ports for teamviewer, he doesn't know what he's doing
 Omega: i'm not gonna argue with you, i know better.
 envygeeks: then you did that intentionally, the average person, you download teamviewer, install, and it works,.

 tortoise: its unlikely it will work w/linux... is that a camera?
 tortoise: very unlikely.. wine doesn't work w/ hardware (which is what you'd be asking it to do).. just plug the camera in, and most likely it will be detected as a flash drive, and you can drag/drop off of it.. then use gimp or whatever, to fix your images
 tortoise: it might work in wine, but i've never gotten wine to work w/ hardware (thus why wine won't work w/ itunes to sync ipods, or zune software to sync zunes, etc..)
 tortoise: you want the nikon to see the camera, correct?.. tell me how it's gonna do that, w/o working w/ hardware
 tortoise: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1447104&page=2   amazing what google shows...
 tortoise: youd idn't bother me.. lol, just saying, google turns up a lot of hits on it (most don't seem tog et it to work)

 i was confused
 bibleboy: why not just properly partition your drive, and install it from a cd?
 bibleboy: you won't lose windows if you pay attention..
 bibleboy: honestly, in my experience, you run a bigger risk of something happening to windows with Wubi,l than a "normal" dual boot system
 bibleboy: just don't say i didn't warn you.. removing wubi is often problematic.. been there.. wn't do it again, its much easier to remove a "normal" ubuntu install.
 bibleboy: wel, good luck.
 bibleboy: and i've done it multiple times, w/ several problems.. so.. i guess we just have different experiences
 Angelic: open a terminal and type "lspci" no quotes, and hit enter.. .loook through the output and find the wireless device, and tell us what it sayas

 red2kic: well, now its fine.. (if you like kDE, i personally hate it) but when it first came out, it was a mess.
 red2kic: your best bet, if you're that unhappy with gnome3/unity.. is to switch to xfce/lxde.. .
 Edgan: lol, i don't know about a few years, but probably a year is fair
 red2kic: well, it's only natural that a desktop interface evolves.. gnome2-gnome3.. only  makes sense.. it's just gonna take time to work the bugs out.
