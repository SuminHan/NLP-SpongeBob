 how do I switch back to gnome on 11.04
 jatt, yeah that's where I looked at first but I didn't find it... let me double check >.>
 Can I use different languages (in this case hebrew, which must go right to left) in the terminal?
 Kevin`, I see what you mean... I found a multi-lingual terminal, but it is too simple and I don't know how to make it left to right.
 Kevin`, I meant right to left :P
 Wow... I can't even tell my left and right without thinking about it... this is a sad day.
 I have ubuntu 11.04 64 bit, and firstly, when I boot up my monitor (not the computer) says optimum resolution exceeded (1400 x 900 @ 60). Secondly when I have more than a few windows open, they start to go completely blank white, and I sometimes have to restart the application to get it to show its content again.
 *when I boot up, my monitor...
 can you just downgrade back to 10.10?
 coz_, it is... it fixes right after my boot splash
 smw, is it possible at all to downgrade? how difficult is it?
 smw, oo! I have an idea... I get an Ubuntu 10.10 installer and use the user account linker thing... and then remove the 11.04?
 smw, good idea?
 smw, one time I was dualbooting Ubuntu and Windows Vista... and it asked me if I wanted to copy all of the files from vista to ubuntu.
 mikael, I am learning french in school :P
 smw, that's good. don't.
 kwtm, prefferably 10.10, but that would also work.
 kwtm, eh, I just don't like the fact that my box is barely usable... yet it worked fine with 10.10
 kwtm, true... but I'm already passed 10.10... and into 11.04, I need to downgrade.
 :) lol
 Dang it! my sombrero! I got coffee on it! :(
