 marlen_jon: broken deps bug was fixeD?
 marlen_jon: ok, thanks. I will try a clean install now
 isarl: are u using xorg.conf
 isarl: remove xorg.conf. remove your drivers(nvidia or ati)
 isarl: then enable nouveau
 isarl: it should get you graphics back
 isarl: renaming would be okay. Driver remove through apt-get. Though i am not sure how to enable nouveau back, after propeartry driver has been installed. Wait a sec.
 isarl: can you access /etc/modprobe.d with nano?
 becky: check xorg logs
 isarl: what file are in directory?
 isarl: nvidia.conf is present?
 isarl: how much files do you have in this directory?
 isarl: one of these files should contain a line 'blacklist nouveau'
 isarl: wth
 isarl: it should be there... check again 'blacklist nouveau'
 isarl: if it was not present nvidia would be conflicting with nouveau
 isarl: try apt-get install nouveau
 isarl: strange as it may seem, but maybe it somehow got uninstalled
 isarl: damn, sorry i don't have any other ideas. Though you should rename your xorg.conf and remove nvidia driver. Maybe it will offer you limited graphics mode after restart.
 isarl: if not, you can always rename xorg.conf back and install your nvidia back
 isarl: list them please
 isarl: write the nvidia package names down on a sheet of paper and remove them
 isarl: on the nouveau part i'm not sure. Btw, i got to go. If after removing drivers and renaming xorg.conf and afterwards restarting pc you don't get graphics back try to install package which step21 specified
 and restart again. good luck'
