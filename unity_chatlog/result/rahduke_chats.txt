I had custom Nvidia drivers installed prior to upgrade, trying to install the new nvidia drivers off their site (which apparently work) but the installer says I need to disable Noveau in X config.... how do i do that

 trueman: i have, been trying to install them for a half hour, the installer says nouveau kernel driver running, need to disable it in some modprobe place and in x conf, did that. no go
 its borked
 tried the nvidia installer and additional drivers....
 trueman: im not having a problem running the installer, its having an issue with nouveau
 ive installed nvidia drivers from their site a hundred times over
  _pg_ that is a pain in the ass
 especially if you have an old controller that is worn out
 its never going to set correctly
 u need brand new sticks, and even then its iffy
 trueman: i cant even get thru my install
 _pg_: you need brand a brandnew controller, the sticks are loose and jscal is too sensitive
 and even then its weak
 they wont be any good on an old controller
 are u talking baout xbox360 controller?
 _pg_: yea man its never going to be "right"
 i messed with jscal for HOURS
 and never got it perfect
 _pg_: your not hearing me, even if u do map them they are not good enough
 _pg_: as you use the remote the sticks get loose and the deadspots kinda move around
 so old controllers really dont work well
 _pg_: ok go for it!
