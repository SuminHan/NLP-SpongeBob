 Hello, human beings. Is there a way how I can install proprietary Nvidia drivers on the Ubuntu 11.04 live CD?
 roasted: That really is not good.
 roasted: Maybe a log in/log out will be enough?
 roasted: Or a X restart?
 roasted: Well, I'd rather give it a try. Could you hint how to do it? "Additional Drivers" thing won't find them, unfortunately.
 roasted: I currently don't have anything better than you talking out loud, so that will have to do. Thanks.
 !restore grub
 !grub
 cheddars: Of course you can, just go to the System->Administrationn->Install Ubuntu
