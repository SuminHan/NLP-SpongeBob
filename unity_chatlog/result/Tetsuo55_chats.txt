 Does unity have weather next to the clock like gnome? i couldnt find an option for it when i tried a nighly livecd a few weeks ago
 hello, how do i enable the weather info next to the clock in unity???
 jatt: :(((((
 jatt:  thats insande, the built-in weather is one of the best things about the ubuntu default clock
 jatt: did we lose the battery too?
 having the running apps on the left sure takes getting used too
 is there any way to display the wire-less connection quality in unity? gnome used to show signal strenght when hovering over the icon
 help the left launcher bar wont go away
 what can i do
 lol this a funny bug, i switched to a higher resolution and all the windows are stuck in the old resolution
 woah
 that was the wierdest bug i ever encountered
 I pressed alt-tab and was greeted by the login screen
 in less than a second ubuntu had logged me out
 and gracefully closed all my apps
 wtf
 unfortunately apport didnt catch it, i did see a quick flash of console output
 can anyon reproduce this? with chrome as the default browser i click on a link in konversation, and instead of switching to chrome the desktop crashes and i have to log in again. and apport does not catch this event
