 Hello. I've bought 3G wireless net. It's not supposed to need a password. On PCLOS it doesn't ask for one and connects automatically. But on Ubuntu it always asks for a password. The problem is, I do not know the password.
 According to the provider there is no password
 I've tried
 pfifo: I've tried
 Anyone here familiar with connecting 3G?
 is there a net work manager better than the default?
 Stereocaulon: I bought a wireless 3G usb thing. With PCLOS I can just plug it in and I have net. But with Ubuntu is always tells me I need a password. The provider says there is no password.
 it continues to demand a password. I've tried all sort of numbers from my contract, even my own password. Nothing works and I can find no setting that says "no password"

 pfifo: can I get this from synaptic?
 pfifo: ok, thanks
 pfifo: I just checked out iwconfig. Honestly, I don't have the time or inclination for reading and studying such. It would be easier to just do a simple reinstall. But here's the thing: one Ubuntu I can get my printer working easily where on PCLOS I cannot. On PCLOS I can get my #G working easily where on Ubuntu I cannot. I really don't have time to sit down and study.
