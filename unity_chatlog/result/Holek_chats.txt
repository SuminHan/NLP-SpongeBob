 is there a configuration backup for compiz after upgrade?
 ActionParsnip: I had my configured Compiz and with the upgrade Ubuntu basically trashed all the configuration I had
 I am not on Unity
 ActionParsnip: the thing is, I didn't do any, and with any other configuration file it always asked me if I'm okay with changes being made...
 great
 and now I get segfault on emerald, toio
 too*
 ActionParsnip: so, where can I change current window decorator options?
 ActionParsnip: LAcan: okay, but ccsm doesn't give me themes, and desktop preferences give me just preloaded themes with no configuration options
 LAcan: nope, integrated Intel
 LAcan: I just want to customize my window decorator, everything else I am setting already in ccsm, I cannot change window decorator theme via ccsm
 LAcan: yes, it does, but my point is, I don't want to "choose", I want to do my own
 LAcan: is it in the repo?
 ActionParsnip: okay, now that I disabled metacity, it looks better
 ActionParsnip: but still doesn't give me any way to customize it
 ActionParsnip: that's the level of configuration I'm looking for: http://imgur.com/O4HGK
 ActionParsnip: and that brings me to my first sentence: emerald gives me segfault
 ActionParsnip: $ emerald --replace
 Segmentation fault
 ActionParsnip: so, no effectr
 hello, guys
 I have a problem: My screen freezes but I can move my mouse. I can still interact with the desktop, but I cannot see any changes I make (ie. after clicking, etc.) I am running GNOME on Natty (not running Unity)
 so, how do I refresh the display to make it work again?
 without killing X

 ladelai: didn't do anything :(
 ladelai: what was it you wanted to do?
 ladelai: aah
 ladelai: nope, that shouldn't be a problem, as then I should be able to go to another workspace and use it properly, right?
 ladelai: which doesn't work
 ladelai: also, right now I am in tty on irssi, if I go to X's (alt+f7), I can see the screen not refreshed (can see irssi) and I can move the cursor
 ladelai: any idea?
 ladelai: I've already tried auto-configuration by plugging in another monitor, that only refreshed the screen to black space with a cursor
 meh, I just killed my X
 thanks for nothing
