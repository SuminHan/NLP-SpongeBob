 Please point me to a web page describing the purpose of SCSI emulation of IDE hard disks. I've looked for a long time now but can't find any explanation for this (plenty reasons for CD/DVD drives, but not hard drives).
 For example, I have an SATA HD but it shows up as /dev/sda, not /dev/hda
 stefg, thanks, so basically the rationale is that it's simpler to deal with a single interface to SCSI/SATA/PATA hard disks than multiple interfaces, AND the wrapper for the latter two has proven to be really stable?
 bubu, 1650, not 1680?
 bubu, have you searched for the model number? I've seen people post their edid files to message boards before.
