 great I upgrade to natty and it won't boot
 "loading initial ramdisk"
 and it hangs
 how do you disable the love handles
 it breaks eclipse
 I wonder why canonical as like "lets just make the next release break everything we can"
 *Was like
 don't do it
 11.04 is broken
 deadpulse: I mean usuability is in the toilet because all kinds of essential things don't work
 like scrolling with the mouse wheel
 and that's when you turn off the horrid unity interface
 and use something that isn't early beta
 like class mode
 *classic
 crasbe: I'm doing that now but it's taking a long time
 yeah window management in ubuntu is just screwed
 fuck why did I upgrade
 fuck I hate 11.04
 it steals your focus
 midwork
 and doesn't give it back
 so you can't save your work
 horrible, horrible release
 asdf_msc: you mean like when it steals the focus from an app and ever lets you click on a button again
 so you get to force close the work you've just spent lots of time on
 and can't save because it's a horrible, horrible release
 asdf_msc: yeah well if you can accidentlly fucking permanantly disable mouse clicks in an app, with no way to return them, it's a pretty serious pebkac
