 jahrends, just turn off your firewall ;) no, actually this will help http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=233146
 ah I've never done it myself, sorry. but they have an irc channel
 jahrends, shown here http://www.ircd-hybrid.org/support.html
 I was pointing you to their irc channel
 also their mailing list is there so you could ask on there.
 or try here by specifying what config option you are stuck at, but it may be less helpful than their own irc channel
