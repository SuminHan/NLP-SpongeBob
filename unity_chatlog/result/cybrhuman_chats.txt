 any great changes after upgrade?
 sebsebseb: good :)
 silly question: unity is the ui from nbr?
 Nando: why is unity a bad move?
 ror: unity?
 Nando: why? with these 16:9 screens we have today unity gives more production screen estate.
 ror: how do you argue that?
 ror: yes, but for many of us the panels were just there eating more screen estate than we liked, but they had to be there. The combination of the everpresent panel and the top bar of the window is nice I think.
 Nando: Not everyone is happy about it of course, but we still have alternatives
 ror: without panels there is no acceptable place for a systray.
 ror: understand me, I am not saying unity is the best for all, but for many I am sure it is. And for people who like to use gnome, gnome is still there. As for forcing a look on the desktop, most users wont do too much about their desktop, they want to use it and not having to configure it. So this is an improvement because you get more screen estate as default
 ror: in a moment
 Nando: I havn't looked too much around looking for all apps, but I expect it gets a fix.
