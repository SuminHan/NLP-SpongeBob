 I like Unity a lot, but I am not used to it yet.
 In what folders does the Dash search for files?

 Anyone know?
 HyperShock: With groups I meant the Personal, Devices etc.
 OchoZero9, I'd guess the Netbook edition would be better for a tablet (assume that's what you mean).
 Anyone here know if it's possible to sync folders from multiple mounted harddrives to Ubuntu One?
 Or am I confined to keep what I want synced in the home folder?
 No Ubuntu One users here who could answer the question?
 OchoZero9: For Ubuntu 10, the only major difference between the Desktop and Netbook editions is the interface.
 _cory, I guess you have a different view of what seems "dumbed down" than what I have. The new interface is a lot better, though it will require time to get used to. :)
 _cory: The preferences are in the "shut down" menu now.
 OverTheHillAndFa, we'll try help the best we can, even if we are not gurus. :)
 Anyone know if there exists a Banshee plugin to add Spotify support?
 sebsebseb, I know, but I'd love to have a plugin for it in Banshee so I wouldn't have to use Wine and it would better integrate with Unity. :)
 Tetsuo55, yes. :)
 Tetsuo55, been busy, getting ready to finish my bachelor degree. In two months I will finally be done. :D
 sebsebseb, it was directed at me, I've been doing some coding on the player. ;)
 Tetsuo55, if you're willing to pay me. :P
 Tetsuo55, it doesn't taste as good as the food I'd get if I had money. :P
 Anyone here know how much work it would be to write a Spotify plugin for Banshee?
 Where do I find Nautilus preferences?
 http://cdn.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2yxnj3c_thumb.jpg <-- Anyone know what icon set is used there?
 I have installed ubuntuone-indicator, but the indicator doesn't show up at the bar.
 Anyone know if this is just a bug or if I might have done it wrong somehow?
 notlistening, now that I have got used to Unity, I really wouldn't go back to Gnome. :)
 Anyone here using the Ubuntu One Applet Indicator?
 JunK-Y: You need to install the Compiz Config, methinks.
 Anyone got the issue with XChat that it doesn't minimize the application to the panel when you choose "Minimize to tray"?
 hihihi100, what kind of bottom bar?
 hihihi100, that bar is still there, I got the Stylish icon on it.
