 does anyone know how I take my NIC out of monitor mode or restart it?
 walent, system/adminstration/language support
 Holek, right click the desktop, last option
 walent, then u need to install the language pack from ubuntu software center
 does anyone know how I take my NIC out of monitor mode or restart it? escott?
 Ubuntu_user, whats the problem you are having?
 escott, just "iwconfig"?
 escott, ty ty
 Ubuntu_user, Holek u have a nvidia?
 Holek, that is normal behaviour. if you want more theme configuration you have to install tweak ubuntu or ccsm for compiz
 Holek, however u should be able to turn on effects thru that method i described
 Ubuntu_user, is ubuntu using the nvida drivers?
 Ubuntu_user, sorry u are having the booting issue correct? the pastebin from earlier?
 Holek, in ubuntu natively thru the theme option in right clicking should allow you a) pick a theme and b) pick the level of desktop effects. this does in fact work correct?
 Ubuntu_user, ok, so we need to fix your boot settings?
 maximus_, its  good idea to put the swap on a physically seperate volume
 Holek, ok, thats above my paygrade, your gonna need a them builder or whatver.... have you tried tweak ubuntu? it has many visual tweaks available
 Holek, tweak ubutu should be, or the PPA is easily findable thru google... but i think its in the native repos yes
 Ubuntu_user, still here? can you mount your window drive in ubuntu?
 neckoox, dns does not include port information
 Ubuntu_user, u can mount your windows drive in ubuntu?
 Ubuntu_user, by answering the questions :) Can you mount your windows drive in ubuntu? can you see your windows files?
 Ubuntu_user_, ok, thats good :) so when you boot, u get the grub boot menu yes? the one which allows you to choose ubuntu?
 Bluebill-Wolf, hello no
 Ubuntu_user_, wait im confused... on that menu there was an option for ubuntu and for windos7 yes?
 Ubuntu_user_, ok. but once you selected windows, the NEXT TIME you booted, the ubuntu boot menu was gone, and instead you got "no OS found"?
 Ubuntu_user_, hrmm ok thats weird.
 Ubuntu_user_, ok so how did you boot into ubuntu THIS time?
 Ubuntu_user_, Ok.. how did you manage to boot windows if "no OS found"?
 Ubuntu_user_, ok download a freeware app called "EasyBCD" for windows
 Ubuntu_user_, ok, then make sure your windows menu looks legit then add an entry for your ubunut partition...
 Ubuntu_user_, no, win7 doesnt use boot.ini
 Ubuntu_user_, i want you to boot windows and using EasyBCD add an entry for "linux" in its options
 Ubuntu_user_, windows really likes to be primary, so your best bet is yo use windows boot menu and ad an entry that points to your ubuntu partition... then when u boot u can pick either OS or switch between grub and winload.exe
 Ubuntu_user_, basically you want to make an entry for windows in grub (u already have it seems) and make an entry for ubuntu in windows...
 Ubuntu_user_, make sure you are not deleting any entries to either, you are just adding them
 Ubuntu_user_, its not a ubunut rpoblem man, its a winload.exe problem. reinstaling ubuntu wont do jack

 is there a way to safely delete my swap partition and add it to my existing filesystem?
 escott, dotblank i have 8GBS of physical memory... is running out a likely problem?
 dotblank, gotcha... now this swapoff... i can just run that through a terminal window?
 dotblank, i can run swapoff and then boot some other OS to grow the partition... sound right?
 dotblank, i can just nuke it?
 dotblank, maybe aill swapoff just to be safe then boot windows and extend the partition... sound safe?
 dotblank, because its ext? i should use a linux grow util like parted then?

 !wicd
 lollo64it, i stumped the bot
 usr13, what is wicd?
 usr13, Pici is that a replacement network manager with more options?
 usr13, does it have a gui at all?
 usr13, also it isnt using dhcp, will that be a problem for wics?
 wicd
 usr13, ya
 usr13, does networkmanager basically overule everything i put in /etc/network/interfaces?
 usr13, well.. is there a way to tell network manager not to config a certain card?
 usr13, any link or info?
 usr13, and then interfaces will be used when I boot intead of when I log in?
 usr13, ok thanks. I'm go try that
 PatrickC_Pre2, yes
 logesh, "/j #<channelname>
 iggyology, ya use "gksudo" instead of just "sudo"
 iggyology, alternately u have to check "Run in Terminal"
 no
 logesh, "/j #<channelname>
 MethedMan, OpenOffice + Latex
 iggyology, edit the shortcut
 ChrisBuchholz, you can edit your keyboard shortcuts thru the menus
 MethedMan, install open office and the latex plugin for it through ubuntu software manager
 codingenesis, if u want to program PC's, dont bother with assembly language
 MethedMan, google is your firend! (i dont use sci notation)
 usr13, ok i removed the network manager applet and now I have 0 network connections.. crap
 iggyology, that means u are running the command as root
 iggyology, if your shortcut requires it, use gksudo instead of "sudo" in the command part of the launcher
 iggyology, if however, there is no "sudo" in the lanucher, then u need to create the lanucher and check "Run in Terminal"
 Weems, theres a grub editor in the system menu
 iggyology, in the lancher properties under Command
 Weems, GRUB something
 Weems, prolly grub editor
 lampe2, yes, install tweak ubuntu
 iggyology, right click the icon
 iggyology, are you in openbox or....? what do you mean by "launcher"?
 iggyology, so you added a panel...? there are no left side icon bars in native ubuntu (10.10 at least)
 iggyology, so create a working shortcut on the desktop, then add it to the panel
 How do I start an interface with the settings in the interfaces file?

 usr13, left me without a net connect... i unnstalled the manager and now i cant get the cards to connect to the internet...
 usr13, man, i cant get any network connections now that i uninstalled the network manager... grrrrr
 bcoop, theres a keyboard shortcuts option in the system menu
 usr13, ya i tried that
 usr13, ya and now my only option is reinstalling ubuntu to get the damn network manager back
 usr13, they wont connect to their essid
 only in ubuntu does it take 3 days to set a static IP address. yeesh.
