 I've googled and searched gconf-editor and compizconfig settings, but I have not found any answer: how can I change the Super+T = Open trash folder keyboard shortcut in Unity?  It replaced my terminal opening shortcut (which is still in the configuration but doesn't function)
 Anyone?  How can the Unity keyboard shortcut for 'Open Trash Folder' <Super>T be configured?  There doesn't appear to be an entry for it in gconf
 LAcan, that option is missing all the 'advanced' unity shortcuts.  It doesn't have an entry for 'open trash folder'
