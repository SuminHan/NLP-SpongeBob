 oh crap..
 just upgraded, unity is.... different.
 where did my taskbar go?! :<<
 incorrect1: no, thats a launcherbar :(
 incorrect1: so they should, but its more of a "programbar" than a taskbar
 accessing setting seems to be a mess now that they arent grouped under a settingsmenu any longer.
 incorrect1: how can i customize it?
 incorrect1: problem is that since i usally have alot o windows open, the old taskbar was rather nice for me to switch between windows
 eigba_: what do you mean by "settings"? since ubuntu dosnt have a unified way of handeling settings..
 incorrect1: i know the concept from OS X, but it feels half done :(
 incorrect1: guess i have to switch to something else as usual :(
 incorrect1: yeah, seems too early, shouldve came as optional for another few months
 incorrect1: i'll probably just switch back to XFCE / FFWM again
 incorrect1: yeah, i can only imagine how bad that would be on my workstation at home with 3x2 physical monitors
 oh well, gonna switch WM, brb
 much beter.
 unity still have to mature some before i would consider to use it
 ouss999: or maybe ubuntu needs to mature.. still no unified place for settings :(
 vox: just choose "classic ubuntu" from the login
 jatt: just choose "classic ubuntu" from the login
 vox: sorry, forgot to say you have to click your name in the list first.
 vox: we just have to wait for unity to grow up and move out i gues.
 vox: sure, if your on a tablet / phone, then it probably is nice
 incorrect1: irony, worthless on the internet since -90s
 incorrect1: you can take some of mine, my coffe allmost came in return this morning :(
