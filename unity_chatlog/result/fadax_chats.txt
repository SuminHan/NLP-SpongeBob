 hi
 i left my ubuntu virtual machine updating to the new version overnight, but during the update it looks like windows update restarted the computer and now i can't boot ubuntu in vmware...  it says "the disk drive for / is not ready yet or not present" .. "press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery"  what should i do?
 can anyone help m?
 me
 Flashtek i can't fix this?  i have to reinstall ubuntu?
 Flashtek i can't  boot from recovery, i get the same error
 Flashtek well i can get a console root@mycomputer if i press "M" for manual recovery
 can i do it from here?
 Flashtek it says "command not found"
 Flashtek oh i found that "grub-install" works, but it says "INSTALL_DEVICE can be a GRUB device name or a system device filename" .. what should i do?
 Flashtek: it says "cannot remove /boot/grub/915resolution.mod - it is a read only file system"
 Braiam oh right.. i was running ubuntu on a virtual machine doe it make a difference?

 Flashtek it says it can't find /dev/sda in fstab when i do that
 Flashtek it says it can't find /dev/sda in fstab when i do that
