 What's the command-line thing to upgrade to 11.04?
 I remember it being not apt-get dist-upgrade
 Is setting up a swap partition on a SSD a good idea?
 wouldn't it result in tons of write cycles?
 bazhang: 128G, but what difference does that make?
 bazhang: Still, given that mine is not, is it worth having one, especially considering that the machine has 12GB of ram
 bazhang: I don't need to hibernate/suspend. I don't think my motherboard supports either of them properly.
 giacomo_c: Does it now show up on your desktop?
 bazhang: K. thanks.
