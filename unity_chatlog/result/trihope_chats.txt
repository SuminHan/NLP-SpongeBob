 Logan_: sorry, didn't know as evident by the word
 spikebike: not sure exactly how to do that. I'm actually on my win 7 boot.  everytime i booted into ubuntu i just had my desktop and didn't know how to open anything
 KM0201: how are you doing this morning?

 nope, that's not working
 k hold on
 ChogyDan: I tried clicking it and it does nothing
 asdf_msc: i guess it's a little more complicated than that. I created a launcher for chrome incognito
 for some reason it has regular chrome open and when I click on the launcher for icognito it won't open a new browser
 asdf_msc: for some reason it has regular chrome open and when I click on the launcher for icognito it won't open a new browser
 asdf_msc: i tried the ctrl+n and it did open a new browser but it's not icognito.  brb
 asdf_msc: back
 asdf_msc: if i click on the regular chrome launcher it will open new regular browser, but the indicator triangle shows up on the icognito launcher even though I don't have icognito window open
 asdf_msc: fixed it. I just ran "unity --replace" and it showed up and launcher seems to be working fine now
 how do i change icons on the unity launcher (the image)
