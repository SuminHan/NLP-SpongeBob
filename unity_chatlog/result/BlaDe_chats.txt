 how can I resave all the files in a directory?
 I've just done a mv dir2 dir --- and dirname(__FILE__) in php returns dir2, until I nano, and overwrite the file... Some weird bug.
 Giles ?
 Giles no -- it's just a require ( dirname(__FILE__) . '/file');
 Giles: i did find . -exec touch {} + ---- this has mostly fixed it
 I think it's possibly APC caching the old file
 Giles I didn't say it did
 resaving the files ALSO updates the access times
 which is what I needed to do, it appears
 Giles - I know.
 Giles why are you telling me what I mean?
 Giles -- resaving the files was updating the access/last modified times.. APC seems to cache files by that. Resaving was fixing it, but what I needed to do was just touch all the files
 find . -exec touch {} +  fixed the issue
 omg? are you reading what i'm saying/
 I'm fully aware what touch does, and what overwriting a file in nano does
 please - stop talking. It's fixed and you aren't reading...
 Is the slow wifi bug fixed yet?
 I have a geforce 7000m and my graphics are all fuzzy --- what driver do i install?
 lockal it doesn't make much sense that an addon is platform dependant
 i could be wrong, though
 lockal ah okay

 my external USB hdd doesn't seem to get detected on ubuntu -- any ideas why?
 minimec nothing in dmesg about it
 Stereocaulon messages doesn't exist on natty
 minimec nope its a passport drive, completely usb powered
 minimec /dev/sda, sda1, sda2 and sda5 exist
 Stereocaulon how do I get a list of usb devices?
 did that, only shows 4 hubs
 my drive lights up so it definitely has power
 and it works on windows
 minimec it used to work on 10.04
 Stereocaulon it's a laptop, they're all on the side
 Stereocaulon usb mouse works
 minimec it's a fresh install and has been rebooted once already
 dmesg | tail doesn't show anything
 I don't think it's a power issue, it works on windows... on the same laptop..
 *** dmesg | tail shows stuff about wlan but nothing when hdd is plugged/unplugged
 minimec nope
 but it works on windows so it can't be a power issue, can it?
 it's an amd chipset, Stereocaulon
 minimec ok np
 Stereocaulon / minimec here?
 It says new high speed usb device using ehci_hcd and address 68
 usb-storage etc etc
 but it doesn't show up anywhere? doesn't seem to mount
 Stereocaulon any ideas why it isn't mounting now?
 scsi10: usb-storage 2-2:1.0 --- but no mount
 Stereocaulon http://pastie.org/1862149
 Tomas just use Ubuntu Classic
 Geoffrey2 it has to be done manually
 Stereocaulon so what's the next step?
 Stereocaulon it's literally a brand new installation done about 3 hours ago
 Stereocaulon nope it's not
 Stereocaulon --- it shows up in lsusb too
 Device 069: ID ....... <model/version/etc>
 ill reboot and test
 all I want to do is move a file from one laptop to another
 it's gonna take 6 hours via wifi
 Stereocaulon it's already rebooting
 Stereocaulon yes
 Stereocaulon it's just booted up, nothing has been plugged in yet
 Stereocaulon no problem hold on while I go through that
 Stereocaulon usbcore says it registered new interface driver ums-cypress
 Stereocaulon it says eery few seconds:
 reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 2
 said that 4 times
 then, scsi 6:0:0:0 Device offlined - not ready after error recovery
 Stereocaulon did you see that, above all the spam?
 any ideas what would cause it ?
 Stereocaulon this is a different HDD now
 has its own power supply -- it's a caddy. just foudn it
 the last one is probably lack of juice as you said
 was a passport drive so entirely usb powered
 Stereocaulon yeah
 Stereocaulon the first one was a 250GB passport drive, nice and portable, wasn't detected AT ALL so likely power issue
 second one is a SATA caddy with its own power supply, is picked up displays in lsusb and gives those errors above.. Doesn't mount.
 multipass_ ubuntu has a pdf reader already
 Stereocaulon heheh yeah, I only have one usb cable :)
 Stereocaulon mouse isn't plugged in
 only used it to test the port
 Stereocaulon no problem. It's getting late now, I'll copy it via wifi overnight.. 6 hours.. lol
 Stereocaulon thanks a lot for your help! Appreciate it
 is anyone around?
 Can anyone help me with making a user locked down a little more?
