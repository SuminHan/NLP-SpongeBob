 If this is the *Official* suport channel, can I assume Canonical staff are on-line here? If so, how am I to distinguish between staff and "n00bz"?
 On an Asus eee 900 is there a way to scale the cpu down from 900mhz while still on AC power?
 How do I enable CPU frequency scaling? [Asus eee 900] It should drop to 620mhz on battery, but doesn't [Ubuntu 10.10]
 ohsix: cat /proc/cpuinfo says it's still at 900mhz.
 bittyx-laptop: yes
 bittyx-laptop: welcome.
 ohsix: I can't make much sense of the output from powertop :( Doesn't seem to mention CPU frequency, just 'wakeups' (whatever they are)
 ohsix: not as far as I know...

 ohsix: thanks for the help - i'll leave it for another day, it's clearly peak support season right now!
 is there a mini iso for 11.04 available? I can only find 10.10
 Found it >> http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
 exfileme: everyone :P
 looks like unity is about as welcome as a fart in a space suit.
 NyvenZA: got the latest vbox?
 NyvenZA: 4.0.6 iirc
 DW-10297: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
 DW-10297: welcome.
 DW-10297: not afaik
 FoolsRun: 11.04 is dissapointing, imo. Especially unty.
 eigba_: I would prefer gnome 3 to gnome 2 + unity
