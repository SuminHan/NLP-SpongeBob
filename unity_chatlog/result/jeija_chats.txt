 ray: you could user the super grub disk
 you could use gnome tweak
 there aren't many options for gnome 3
 preyas: have a look at this: http://blog.fpmurphy.com/2011/03/customizing-the-gnome-3-shell.html
 most parts should also work for ubuntu
 especially the gnome3 tweak section
 preyas, do you mean ubuntu tweak or gnome 3 tweak?
 oussama: if you want to fix your system from a live cd, you chroot in to the system
 gac: you could try to fix it with the super grub cd or the ubuntu live cd
 gac: are you sure both drives are plugged in at the moment?
 eddie_: xfce, lxde. kde (won't break unity) gnome 3 (will break unity), classic gnome (at login)
