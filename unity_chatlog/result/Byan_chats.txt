 was the xorg.conf moved recently?
 where is it now..
 ZykoticK9: hrm, how do I create a default conf? the dpkg-reconfigure command I executed didn't work
 ZykoticK9: why do i need to stop gdm..
 ZykoticK9: apparently --configure isn't a option of X..
 an
 Xorg --configure
 I suppose you meant
 no, hrm
 ZykoticK9: no, it's -configure not --configure, I see now
 anyway
 it failed =/
 Stryker: releases are on a schedule.. shouldn't be surprising..
