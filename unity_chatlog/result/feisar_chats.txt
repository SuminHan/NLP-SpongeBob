 Hi, just installed Natty, how do I configure which time servers to use now?
 it seems natty is set to 'automatically get time from the internet' but I don't know what it's using to do it or how to configure it
 rigved: thanks but there is not an option for changning which time servers it gets the time from
 rigved: yeah, I think it's using ntpdate which is only good for setting time initially
 where can I find an in depth list of changes made in ubuntu 11.04?
 p_res: thanks, where can I find them?
 p_res: thanks found them... nothing about ntp though
 Pici: 'synchronise time with internet servers' is now ticked by default but ntp is not installed. I would like to know how it is synchronising and how I can change the servers it uses
 Ljl: it is, do you know where  it's config file is?
 Ljl: thanks
 pants... updating from 10.10 to 11.04 using the alternate cd has broken my system
 man... I'm having no luck with 11.04, the upgrade screwed up my system and now a fresh install is stuck in an error loop
 BinaryMan: that's not good to hear
