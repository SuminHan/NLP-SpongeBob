 What's the best tiling window manager for Xubuntu (i.e. XFCE)? Xmonad?
 jrib: I should put it another way. I have never used any, so I don't know what my options are. Googling xfce+tiling doesn't reveal much; I think the only name I spot right away is Xmonad. I would just like to know if that's my only option.
 rpk: not for me.
 jrib: lol, what a name.
 On a motherboard with AMI BIOS, should I set the "Plug And Play O/S" option to "Yes" or "No"? Which choice would be optimal?
 oh great
 I was trying to install Google Chrome from deb package on my newly-installed Xubuntu 11.04.
 totally messed up Package Manager
 ActionParsnip: ya, but I still need to fix package manager
 I get some weird message about "E: Encountered a section with no Package: header"
 "The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened."
 Xubuntu is stuck while trying to reboot after initial setup.
