 ActionParsnip: hmm, it does seem a tad peppier, but I'm getting horizontal tearing when I move windows around as if 2d acceleration is still not really working
 ActionParsnip: is it possible to turn off compositing?
 ActionParsnip: speaking of that, I don't like the little left-hand osx-esq launcher thing; can I have my gnome taskbar back? :P
 ActionParsnip: the 2d acceleration feels nicer now, but there's no taskbars
 ActionParsnip: in fact, if I were'nt in a terminal right now I'd probably be in a slight amount of trouble (at least probably forcing me to restart x)
 ActionParsnip: ok
