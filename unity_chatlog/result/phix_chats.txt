 wow, The new default UI for Ubuntu is terrible
 Who's idea was that?  Did they happen to be a left handed person?
 BlouBlou: yeah I am using the classic
 LjL: No it is a support question, how do can you configure unity?
 LjL: hi btw! *wave*
 vish: yeah I figured that out my self :)
 vish: and the minimise, maximise, close button change locations when you have the window maximised or in windowed mode
 also the default bluetooth manager is a POS.
 Always fails
