 is there a way to untar a file.tar.gz where the resulting file is not nested, but in a specified directory? Using 'tar -zxvf file.tar.gz ./path/to/file/wanted_file' results in the file nested in the parent dir
 Aginor: ok
 Aginor: thanks
 Aginor: no, but was trying to find capital c in man tar'
 'tar -zxvf file.tar.gz ./path/to/file/wanted_file' -C ./wanted_file results in something almost, but not entirely unlike joy
 Aginor: After failing a few times, i thought i'd ask. lets say you want some file extracted to the current directory from baz.tar.gz where inside BAZ.tar.gz the location of file is ./foo/bar/baz
 Aginor: yes, only one file
 Aginor: ok
 Aginor: 'tar -C ./boot -zxf /mnt1/OpenBSD/4.9/i386/base49.tgz ./usr/mdec/boot' still results in nested file. I am not knowing where to put the -C
 Aginor: ok thanks for looking
 Aginor: yes
 Aginor: 'tar: Cannot chdir to ./boot: No such file or directoryy'
 remoteCTRL1: ty
 Aginor: ok ty again for the look
 Aginor: looked into using pax, but, after severl failed attempte I opted to go with the 'dip computer in vat of fuming sulfuric acid' approach
 exit
