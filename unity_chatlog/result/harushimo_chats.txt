 does ubuntu have python 2.7 on repositories?
 I'm running 10.04 LTS
 is it available for that
 I know python 2.6.5 is for lucid. why isn't only available for unity and lucid
 I mean not lucid
 that make sense
 right
 ok
 thank you
 i'll try it out
 thank you
 for android development in ubuntu, is it better to do the plugin for eclipse or the actual sdk
 that is what I thought
 I just want to make sure. Thank you
