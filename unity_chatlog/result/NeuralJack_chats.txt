 is there a way to install Natty WITHOUT that cursed "Unity Desktop"?
 Roasted:  I've spent 2 days on Unity, can't find anything easily, the programs are less organised and every time I look for something, I get Advertisements for what's available for download.  so far, I haven't found a single way how it makes anything easier.
 Sure, roasted, I understand.  I"ll give it another try in the future.
 thanks for the answers, everyone.
