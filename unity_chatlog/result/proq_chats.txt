 I'm installing ubuntu via wubi, I would like to give the system 80GB but it will only let me give at the most 30.  How do I do this?
 ayecee: I can't imagine why.  I have 119 MB free and the system is only 2 days old so I'm sure it isn't fragmented
 119GB free, yes
 arun___: it isn't the 28th yet
 arun___: if they were to release at 11:59 PM PST on the 28th, that would be in 25 hours
 not that I'm saying that they said which time zone or hour
 yeah  :)
 happy ubuntu release eve!
 I'm installing ubuntu over my windows 7 netbook, happy day

 theGreatDane: I'm more productive on ubuntu, for a variety of reasons  :)
 party party!
 llutz_: most people set up /dev/brain > /dev/null
 what is unity?
 sobersabre: you don't see the context?
 sobersabre: <EbanSoul> Is Unity still going to be the default for 11.04 or have they moved to KDE?
 vibhav: a shell interface - do you mean a terminal emulator?
 phoque_uni: you would apt-get install it I suppose
 phoque_uni: just a wild guess
 I started an ubuntu install with wubi over win7. it got past download and status said install about two hours ago, now the progress bar is about 60% and hasn't moved in an hour. what should I do?
 Incarus6: hrm... that's a lovely thing to find out after a five hour install
 guest345345: no, wubi hit an error and just stopped
 almoxarife: when I selected netbook from wubi, it started grabbing ubuntu 10.04
 well, maybe tomorrow I can grab wubi netbook 11.04 and try again
 or just the full version
 almoxarife: wireless connection to a wireless router
 almoxarife: it didn't say what stage it was in, just that it was installing
 almoxarife: ok good to know, I'll try with a cable
 seniseni: 10% of ubuntu 11.04?
 seniseni: awesome, I'm going to go to bed and install 11.04 tomorrow with wubi  :D
 I would like wubi to install ubuntu 11.04 and not 10.04. I have already tried to run and install wubi with 10.04 but it failed; are there any files I have to cleanup first?
 ubuntu netbook 10.04 I mean
 step21: ok, thanks
 wubi on windows 7 is only allowing me 30GB to install ubuntu, but I have 119GB free.  how do I give it 80GB?
 yeah, about 9 hours ago
 why? does unity use opengl?
 what shell command do I run to take a CD installer and copy it to a usb stick?
 virtualbox is great if you don't mind broken 3D most of the time
 (and tons of issues with usb)
 when I run gnome, the mouse settings that I change don't take effect in other window managers.  how do I get them to stay on?
