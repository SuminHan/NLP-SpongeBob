 Would anyone like to know how to get the weather applet/indicator back into the top "panel"/bar in 11.04 ? :)
 tanath: well it's no longer there in 11.04 ... I'll tell you how to get it back :)
 tanath: no ... in 11.04 it's gone! No longer built into the time/date
 tanath: so what you do is install "indicator-weather" from Synaptic or terminal ... then add it to Startup Applications ... logout/login ... ;)
  tanath: i was so overjoyed when I found it in synaptic ... hehe ... I should probably read more of the docs on the release ...
  tanath: no probs ... I also found out how to make the sidebar launchers smaller
  tanath: sorry ... dunno about tooltip ...
  tanath: Unity lacks a GUI interface for editing the dash and sidebar ... but I am hoping it will come soon
  tanath: oh ... I haven't paid any attention to that ... :P
  tanath: ah, I see what you mean ... I will have to check that out when I get home ... (at the office atm ...)
  tanath: from what I am seeing here (on the net) it's supposed to have it ...
  tanath: mmk?
  tanath: gotcha ...
  tanath: why are you not running 11.04?
  tanath: yeah, I have had mixed feelings about it too
  tanath: though one could always upgrade and just use the classic session instead ...
 histo: mostly due to Unity right!?
  tanath: definitely the smart route
  tanath: so your really holding out on this one
 histo: I hear you
  tanath: do you think "they" will allow for the customisation of the launcher side-bar and dash in the future?
  tanath: true that
 khaotik: you may not be alone in that sentiment, but make it useful and add something productive to the forums ;)
  waterman: it has been a very smooth upgrade for me
