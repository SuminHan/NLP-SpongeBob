 hi. how can i change the workspace grid from a 2x2 to the old 1x4 grid?
 escott, i can't seem to find it
 escott, Ive looked in expo and desktop wall
 Samsagax, right click on the switcher doesnt bring up any options in the launcher
 Samsagax, yes, Im using 11.04. there's no way to change the 2x2 grid to a 1x4?
 Samsagax, yup, I know in the old version it worked. strange you can't change it in unity
 Samsagax, I like the screen space gain in unity. but it seems to be a little crippled as of yet
 jibadeeha, thanks. that did the trick
 hi. I'm using 11.04. I installed dropbox and it is working fine, but the tray icon is not showing up. if I do dropbox stop and then start it shows up... any idea how can I get it automatically? althought it doesn't show it is working in the background
