 hey guys
 have there been known issues with the wubi installer in 11.04?
 can anyone please me help me with my wubi installation of ubuntu?
 zenguy311, when rebooting after the wubi ubuntu install, I get the error that the "root partition is not defined"
 zenguy311. it doesn't complete the install
 zenguy311, but wouldn't that corrupt my windows mbr?
 zenguy311: yes, im on my windows installation right now. I could uninstall and reinstall ubuntu wubi for a 3rd time via the program manager
 ZenGuy311: How do I complete the install inside windows? I thought the install would complete itself after it'd ask to reboot.
 zenguy311, well at the reboot it tried to complete the install but it failed saying that the root partition wasn't defined
 ZenGuy311, Well I've just been using the step by step that's on the DVD. What's the better way of going about this?
 ZenGuy311: okay. Well I'll try and do some research then. It's a shame they have to make it so exhausting to figure out.
 ZenGuy311: Thanks for the help
