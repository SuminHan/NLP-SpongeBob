 Hi. I am getting an error when trying to format a USB drive: Error creating file system: helper exited with exit code 1: cannot mount /dev/sdg1 at /tmp/job-mkfs-CuICaQ: No such file or directory
 After this error the OS seems to disable the drive.
 I'm using disk utility. Trying to format it to ext4.
