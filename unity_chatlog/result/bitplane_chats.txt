 jforman, both behaviours should work together. works for me anyway
 jforman: no I mean if you drag all the way to the left or right you go to the next desktop, if you almost touch the edge you get the Win7 style window half-maximized thing
 twoten, sounds like Compiz has died. open a command prompt and type "killall compiz; setsid compiz --replace"
 varunvyas: I recommend archiving your /home/youruser directory and saving it somewhere, then reinstalling from scratch
 kpoman, press left super and type ccsm"
 *ccsm
 xsinick_laptop: I imagine it will get better, Unity is Canonical's way of making their own desktop experience without having to go through the design by committee method of open source design. so I guess we'll get a slicker desktop experience in future
 if you don't like it then go back to gnome desktop manager or install kubuntu
 kpoman, use Compiz Config instead. all the options are in there
 kpoman, if you're using Unity 3d (the default) then you have desktop effects enabled anyway
 xsinick_laptop: yeah and anyone who uses a GUI just can't handle the command line and doesn't have a beard or smell of wee
 xsinick_laptop: what do you mean by "proper dual screen support"?
 xsinick_laptop: I've got 3 screens here, works okay for me (so long as primary output is the leftmost monitor, which is a bug)
 xsinick_laptop: report any bugs to all relevant parties
 xsinick_laptop: haha okay
 izinucs: no real difference here IMO, also when I was on beta 1 I just used GDM instead because of an ATI driver bug. choose ubuntu classic at login and you get the old desktop
 izinucs: you get the win7 style window resizing thing which is cool, you can have two partially maximized windows per screen
 izinucs: I'm not sure, do you mean the GDM panel things? I was using AWN with no bottom bar and that was exactly the same after I upgraded
 sebsebseb: tough shit, change something as huge as teh default desktop experience and people are bound to complain. specially when people have customized gdm for years and it all stops working
 Toph, what happens?
 Toph, have you tried using the "Ubuntu Classic" option from the drop-down at the bottom of the screen? sounds like Unity is crashing
 truepurple: I'm using ATI gfx, can't say I know much about it other than it mostly just works. what do you need to know?
 truepurple: oh, can't help you there, I have a 5970 and chose the default driver from the notification in the notification bar
 truepurple: the additional drivers notification that pops up after you install. I suggest trying that first, if it doesn't work then remove the drivers using apt-get from the command line and try another option
 truepurple: did you try the additional drivers thing?
 truepurple: yeah I've been using it since beta 1, I installed the drivers from the additional drivers menu thing
 researcher123: new desktop experience with a sidebar and search instead of menus (called Unity), windows 7 style maximization and window moving, fully integrated with Compiz. Currently not very mature and may have some teething problems but in fairness it's not that bad
 truepurple: yes I'm using Unity with ATI proprietary drivers that automatically installed
 researcher123: I'd guess YouTube is probably your best bet, search for ubuntu unity
 truepurple: I'm using the proprietary drivers because I need "eyefinity" with 3 monitor support
 truepurple: no it's triple head, need special drivers to support more than two (dual) outputs. Eyefinity supports up to 6 currently
 xsinick_laptop: if you don't like Unity don't use it, stop moaning and choose "ubuntu classic" from the log in menu
 truepurple: yeah I'm using one card with 3 outputs, so they're all the same desktop/workspace and 3d effects work across them like a single monitor. if you have multiple cards you don't get effects across them
 truepurple: I guess so
 truepurple, yes but I don't know the actual command
 truepurple: the ATI site download means you *may* get a later version of the drivers, but since Natty is new there's probably no difference at the moment. if you install from the site then you have to mess about if you want to uninstall
 Guest6900: right click the swap with the key on it and choose "swapoff", then delete the sda5 swap, then resize sda7 swap so it fills all the space
 Guest6900: then right click and choose "swapon"
 Guest6900: they're like a windows "paging file", they're where your programs get pushed out to when you run out of RAM
 truepurple: yeah, you can remove it from apt-get like anything else. you can't just remove the one you install from AMD's website.. there's a shell script to uninstall that one
 OY1R: looks like your filesystem table is broken somehow, not sure how to fix it but it should be relatively simple
 truepurple: not sure what it's called
 OY1R: I guess you need to find the UUID of your disk and change that line in your fstab
 OY1R not sure how to do that though or how things work at that stage of the boot process, so take what I say with a pinch of salt
 NictraSavios: the crash bugs are resolved AFAIK
 spthysis_: I'm also having some pulseaudio bugs, but if you open sound preferences you should be able to configure the input/output choices through the GUI
 I personally wouldn't run anything other than NTFS on a Windows install, sounds like asking for trouble
 ball, everyone likes cake. also yes, you can use virtualbox to boot an ISO, or mount one from within Ubuntu by right clicking on it
