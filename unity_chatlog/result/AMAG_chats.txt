 No doubt this is a common question, but is there a FAQ item telling me how to get my nvidia driver working after 11.04 upgrade?  Under "Additional Drivers," I am told "This driver is activated but not currently in use."
 nvidia driver help on 11.04, anyone?
 atavist:ifconfig
 I upgraded a test machine first.  Glad I did, since the test machine is now totally unusable
 ror: I saw a blog or something about that today.  I think your "classic" problem may be common.
 I do not like how I just clicked restart from a logged-in user and it just returned to the login screen
 Is there a FAQ item or something for 10.x -> 11.04 upgrade, nvidia driver installed and "activated" (green dot on Additional Drivers tool) but "not currently in use?"  I cannot figure this out.
 Is there a version of that nvidia FAQ which applies to 11.04?  I upgraded from 10.10 and I am having nothing but trouble.
 hiexpo:I just read that, but I don't see an 11.04 section
 My card worked fine with 10.10.  What I have now is that the driver is "green" or activated under Alternative Drivers (?) but that tool says "..is activated, but is not currently being used."
 I've been trying to get some help with my graphics driver on Ubuntu 11.04 for several days, but no luck so far.  In the "Additional Drivers" tool, my NVIDIA driver has the green dot, yet the tool says "This driver is activated but not currently in use."  Help please.
 l403: No, but I just have looked.  I have a Section "Device" which says Driver "nvidia" and no other Device sections
 coun: nvidia cards have treated me better than others on Linux for more than 10 years.  I don't think you will be any happier with ATI.
 lsmod |grep nvidia  does indeed show a module called "nvidia" that is loaded, and dmesg |grep -i taint shows me that loading this module taints the kernel
 l403: so it is certainly loaded into the kernel, but it appears X is not using it?
 l403: that has added numerous blocks to my xorg.conf file, but restarting the PC still didn't get it to actually use the driver.  The "Additional Drivers" tool still says the same thing
 l403: nvidia-settings detects the display and graphics card, and I did a "save" from this program which did modify xorg.conf again, and rebooted again, yet the driver is still not being used.
 l403: the nvidia-current one?
 l403: Well, removing nvidia-current and rebooting has affected something.  Now the display appears broken and gdm cannot start, but the machine isn't locked up, just the display.  So I guess I'll straighten that out and try installing nvidia-current again.
 l403: actually the "failsafe graphics mode" choice in the recovery menu worked, so i am re-installing nvidia-current now and will see what happens in a few minutes.
 How could gdm be depending on nvidia-current but it isn't the X driver that X is running?  This seems strange.
 l403: Same situation after re-installing nvidia-current.  X works but "Additional Drivers" claims the nvidia driver isn't in use, and 3D acceleration is clearly not working because glxgears like doesn't even budge, the system is almost hung when running it, and it claims it is running at 17,000 frames/second, but obviously that's not true
 well, I dunno, maybe it could be but the gears aren't moving and the system is useless :)
 l403: I'll probably still be here struggling with X when you come back :)
 glxinfo says "server glx vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation" and I have no (EE) lines in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 l403: sure
 brando:Yes, it says "direct rendering: Yes"
 Brandano: Yes.  I think it might be that "glx" is not loaded into X?
 l403:My xorg.conf does not have this anywhere:   Load     "glx"
 Brandano: Driver      nvidia
 from looking at /var/log/Xorg.0.log it seems like the nvidia driver is running, as is glx, but I can't understand why glxgears does not work and the "Additional Drivers" tools says it isn't being used.
 Yeah, I rebooted since then, several times. :)
 Yes, and it is able to detect the monitor and the graphics card.  I hit "save" and it modified Xorg.conf, but all it seems to have done is add descriptions.
 I'm really confused as this all worked fine before I upgraded to 11.04, from 10.10.  I admit it's been quite a few years since I've had to fight with X to make things work. :)
 l403:any other ideas?  My Xorg.conf file looks functionally identical to yours, except Load glx, but I added that to mine and it did not do anything (other than emit a message to Xorg.0.log about how it's both automatic and configured)
 CQ: I can't imagine what that would be.  My ubuntu 10 install was pretty vanilla; I didn't fool with it at all.
