 I just downloaded "ubuntu-11.04-alternate-i386.iso" to upgrade my ubuntu10.10 without any downloading, but when I mounted it and typed "gksu "sh /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade", it wanted to connect to internet and download all the packages again? how can I upgrade my ubuntu10.10 to 11.4 without any downloading?
 no idea?
 still no answer?
