 I just upgraded to 11.04 and it uninstalled my proprietary video drivers and now they cannot be found in additional drivers.  I cannot enable compositing now when I could before.  dell insperon 6400 : any suggestions?

 I just installed 11.04, I have ATI Mobility Radeon X1300, which is in ubuntu wiki's list of supported cards, and jocky is not showing me proprietary drivers
 and I cannot compozite when I could in 10.10
 how do I get X11 to use FGLRX and not ATI's free drivers?

 yea I dont get why ubuntu is ditching gnome3
 ubuntu 11.04 broke my compiz support baddly
