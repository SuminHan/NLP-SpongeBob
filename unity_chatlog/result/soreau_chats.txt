 SkrappJaw: What wifi chip?
 SkrappJaw: What is the output of 'lspci|grep Network'?
 ! who | SkrappJaw
 SkrappJaw: Are you sure the wifi card is enabled in the bios?
 SkrappJaw: I don't know. Can you pastebin the output of 'lspci' to pastebin.ca?
 sobersabre: Try sys>prefs>monitors
 Soothsayer: #ubuntu-release-party
 silvery: Also, natty is still not supported here until after the official release
 Soothsayer: yes
 silvery: Until -later- today
 sobersabre: What graphics card do you have?
 sobersabre: What graphics card do you have?
 sobersabre: Have you tried the applet in system>preferences>Monitors?
 smw: I don't think vga=xxx is supported with kms
 smw: You use video=1280x1024@60
 smw: worksforme doesn't hold much weight
 sobersabre: Right, I misunderstood you in the first place
 sobersabre: Basically what you're seeing is when the intel module is loaded with kms
 sobersabre: For example you would use something like this as a kernel param: video=VGA-1:800x600
 sobersabre: But the name VGA-1 may be different
 sobersabre: I'm trying to find it now..
 sobersabre: I cant seem to find it right now but you have to cat something in /proc IIRC..
 sobersabre: Ok I found it
 sobersabre: ls /sys/class/drm/ and use these to make a kernel line video=VGA-1:1024x768 for example
 newbie28: What wifi chip is it?
 newbie28: What encryption type?
 newbie28: Is there any reason you arent using nm-applet?
 newbie28: Which version of ubuntu?
 newbie28: nm-applet is the default network management applet that appears in gnome-panel
 Rehan: ubuntu has gnome by default and kubuntu has kde by default
 Rehan: The official ubuntu distro uses gnome, if that tells you anything..
 newbie28: I guess you would have to undo whatever you did to switch in the first place

 Man this sucks. Bug #1: Can't enter a custom mount point after selecting Edit for an existing partition from the live 11.04 desktop cd installer
 Alright people where the hell is the menu in this natty unity thing. I'm wanting to find monitor properties configuration applet and keyboard preferences etc from sys>prefs like in maverick
 fcuk112: The power button?
 ohsix: Type what in?
 tase: Yes, totally
 They shouldn't have even pushed it out this fast IMO
 gogeta: No it means that it's default and it sucks
 Hello71: Tell me something useful that I don't know
 Why doesn't Alt+F2 work when metacity is running?
 Why doesn't Alt+F2 work with metacity in 11.04?
 robin0800: That was not my question
 Why doesn't Alt+F2 work with metacity in 11.04?
 robin0800: Why didn't you say that in the first place?
 ohsix: You mean gnome-panel has to be running
 ohsix: Yes you're right, thanks.
 I can see the menu now too, whew
 What a constricting piece of garbage unity is
 ohsix: Don't OT me when I'm talking about unity
 ohsix: You don't support unity here??
 ohsix: The default wm scheme in ubuntu 11.04?
 ohsix: I didn't say it sucked
 I said it was a constricting piece of garbage
 ohsix: As a support helper, you should ask why one thinks that and try to help them with the specific problem they're having
 ohsix: By saying "#ubuntu-offtopic" that
 ohsix: By saying "#ubuntu-offtopic" that's just like saying you know it is just that
 ohsix: admittance
 ohsix: What adjective?
 ohsix: You're not taking the correct action. You're shrugging off unity support
 gosh darn it why can't they just put the icons on all menus already
 How can you get icons to appear on System menu in gnome-panel?
 arand: Yea, I know that. I was asking where
 wurfs: It's a gconf key somewhere

 arand: thanks
 that was it
 Great. I went to remove my name from the panel and the entire right side disappeared
 wtf guys? I tried to remove my name from the panel and all the information on the right side disappeared. Adding Notification Applet does not bring it back
 ohsix: Smooth move, the panels disappeared and now there are *no* panels
 Omega: It was running
 Omega: ohsix: I had to restart it again
 ohsix: Hey, don't make rude comments to me
 <ohsix> soreau: if you've got some brain death going on there i don't know what to tell you <-- I find this very rude and offensive
 ohsix: Do not make rude comments to me
 ohsix: Leave me alone because you are not helping
 I need to know why, when I try to remove my name from gnome-panel, it removes the entire right side of the panel info
 ohsix: Don't talk to me
 /ignore ohsix
 err..
 sebsebseb: Classic gnome-panel
 sebsebseb: You're not helping either
 I want to know why when trying to remove my name from gnome-panel, the entire right side of everything disappears
 arand: Yes how do you edit it?
 arand: And what is the applet called?
 Sliker[Bed]: It is a rude comment to me
 I don't care what you think
 sebsebseb: Yes it's not like 10.10
 sebsebseb: You didn't see what he msg'd me
 arand: But what is the applet called?
 I want to know why when trying to remove my name from gnome-panel, the entire right side of everything disappears
 ohsix: sebsebseb: arand: dasy2k1: How can I edit it though?
 I don't want all that crap in my panel

 Ok why the hell is a terminal popping up and starting orca all by itself? I exit the terminal and it opens again and starts talking! How can I disable this???
 Hey guys I opened sound preferences and now at the same time, a terminal popped up and it's running orca apparently because it's talking. When I close the terminal it opens itself again and starts orca again! How can I disable this?

 Where is the menu in 11.04? For example, I just want to find Internet applications (in gnome-panel menu it is Applications>Internet>)
 Hoyt: Yes, choose classic gnome from the session menu before logging in
 HyperShock: I dont see what you are talking about
 HyperShock: I see what you mean now.. this upper right menu is not visible at first until clicking more applications or anything
 HyperShock: Way more to do just to see the menu than in gnome 2.0/maverick
 HyperShock: I just want an easy way to access the menu
 my panels aren't working in unity and I just want to log out (not reboot). How can I logout from CLI?
 _genuser_: I started gnome-panel to access logout
 ugh, I selected ubuntu classic but it's still loading unity
 What is the deal?
 coz_: Hey, me first: I selected ubuntu classic but it's still loading unity
 What is going on with this thing?
 celthunder: Am I supposed to have to do that?
 coz_: probably
 coz_: It doesn't start gnome-panel though
 coz_: I rebooted and it's still broken
 coz_: Well yea I know how to start it.. I just want to know why 'Ubuntu Classic' is still loading unity. It worked the first time I tried it but it's broken now
 Rehan: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 Rehan: Or .old
 Hey guys, where is the 'Home' button in chromium?
 found it in settings
 Now where is the Reload button in chromium?
 oh no wonder, it's 'under' the stop button
 I selected classic ubuntu and it worked. Selected unity again, it switched. Now after this, classic ubuntu session is still unity, even after several restarts. Why is it broken?
 Guys no matter what I do, I cannot get back into ubuntu classic mode. Even when I switch to it, it still starts unity session unity
 Guys my natty wont load ubuntu classic session. It worked the first time, but since I switched to 'ubuntu' and back to 'classic ubuntu', now all sessions load unity regardless. How can I fix it?
 My natty wont load ubuntu classic session. It worked the first time, but since I switched to 'ubuntu' and back to 'classic ubuntu', now all sessions load unity regardless. How can I fix it?
 Is there some file that controls the session?
 zizban: That directory doesn't even exist. I would assume it would be some file in /etc
 happolati: Pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log file to pastebin.ca
 zizban: That appears to contain the session files, but not the config file to select which it's using
 zizban: yep
 zizban: Yes
 zizban: clean install
 zizban: I doubt it. The classic session worked the first time but since switching to 'ubuntu' and back to 'classic ubuntu' now both load unity
 zizban: I just want to know what happens exactly (or what's supposed to happen) when switching sessions
 zizban: I assume some config file is changed but I have no idea where that might be
 zizban: I am requesting the ubuntu gdm source in the devel channel
 zizban: 'locate defaults.conf|grep gdm' shows no output
 multipass_: Probably not if you don't say what's wrong with it
 multipass_: Join the crowd. They really totally screwed up compiz and this whole 11.04 release
 multipass_: If you feel like getting ignored, file a bug
 Omega: Whatever.
 I'm just telling it like it really is
 If you don't want to see a real attitude, feel free to shut up.
 gtech: Typically a kernel panic is caused by a faulty kernel module
 gtech: Which graphics card do you have?
 quint: It's basically a lockup where your keyboard LEDs start blinking
 gtech: Is that an nvidia model?
 gtech: Can you boot into recovery mode ok?
 gtech: Try blacklisting the nvidia kernel module by creating a file called /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia.conf and putting 'nvidia' on a single line without quotes
 gtech: Also remove /etc/X11/xorg.conf if it exists
 red2kic: I don't think it ever went away
 chaospsyX: It's not that funny, really

 red2kic: Hey, watch your aptitude buddy
 ;)
 Guest17232: Does it work ok with any other OS on the same machine?
 gtech: Did you check those log files? esp syslog?
 gtech: I'm only guessing the nvidia module is the problem
 gtech: Have you tried unplugging any devices you can such as your xbox controller?
 gtech: I still think it's loading the nvidia module too
 gtech: Can you try booting with nvidia.dontloadme=1 nouveau.dontloadme=1 ?
 gtech: yes, as kernel args
 gtech: Append to the linux line, where it ends with something like ro quiet splash
 gtech: It worked?
 gtech: Well I'm just about out of ideas then
 gtech: Try a livecd and see if it helps. If so, a clean install should work
 gtech: no problem, best of wishes
 buhman: What's the question?
 aLeSD: You don't want any panel at all?
 aLeSD:From your terminal: 'sudo chmod -x /usr/bin/gnome-panel; killall gnome-panel' and to undo it 'sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/gnome-panel; gnome-panel & disown'

 glacia: Perhaps you need to make it executable first?
 alphamale: just install ubuntu as you normally would but select manual partitioning and select the usb stick node from gparted
 glacia: Open a terminal, cd into the directory where the .exe is and run 'wine program.exe' and pastebin the output to paste.ubuntu.com and post the link here
 ! ch | crack888
 oops
 alphamale: When you select manual partitioning, it should show the partitions already on it
 alphamale: So create one
 ! ask | buhman
 buhman: I still have yet to see you ask your full initial question
 red2kic: So tell him to use debian?
