 _cory I already asked :) I need some help if somebody can help me please. I'm trying to connect to my wireless network but I can't make it working with WPA2 Personal. Please help
 _cory: No error, it's like I'm typing the wrong password. the network was hidden and I changed it to visible, but same problem. It's a problem as Nickname_ said ?
 _cory I can try it. Maybe WPA will be ok....I don't want to change to WEP because I have some which will love to use my network :D
 I think I need modem reset...brb
 _cory ?
 I start to reconnect and the network connection button dissapeared
 how to add it back ?
 _cory it's not working :(
 can somebody help me to make my wireless network functional please ?
 I can't conenct to my network, I tried with WPA and WPa2...it's like when the key is wrong :( LAcan
 LAcan that's one that I didn't tried yet :)
 LAcan so I need to switch the password to hex, but then I need to add it normally or editing the file
 LAcan I want to tell you that I have hex just for WEP, not WPA
 so...nobody know to fix the wireless problem...guess I need to switch to windows...:((
