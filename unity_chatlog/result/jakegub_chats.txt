 Is there a fix yet for the blank screen during NEW install of 11.04?
 ActionParsnip: Geforce 540m on a Clevo notebook
 ActionParsnip: forgive me, During installation I add that as a --tag to the boot options?
 ActionParsnip: I will try it.  Thank you for the suggestions.

 bazhang: Not an option on mine.  Pastebin expired.  Re-pasting  http://pastebin.com/U4x91z5P
 bazhang: it's the 540m   I haven't tried using the proprietary drivers yet.  I was actually willing to do without the dedicated graphics, but maybe that's the thing to try first is using the nvidia set
 bazhang: proprietary drivers say they're installed but not in use
 bazhang: I'm sorry it says they're activated but not currently in use
 bazhang: are you saying to remove the drivers, then re-install them?
