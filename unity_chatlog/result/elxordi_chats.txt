 hi, can someone help my with a graphics issue on my ubuntu 11.04?
 katorz: sudo apt-get install unity
 katorz: which ubuntu version?
 katorz: on live, there's already the unity interface activated, if it doesn't show up, maybe the problem is that your graphic doesnt have the correct drivers on live
 vibhav: me, graphic issue. Interested? :P
 vibhav: i've runned glxgears, and gives me good framerate, but graphics arent smoother. That's with latest Ati drivers. any ideas?
 katorz: if you install them live and you restart, the canges doesnt apply. You must install ubuntu on hard disk
 vibhav: i've googled for a while and found nothing :(
 katorz: what graphics device has your computer?
 vibhav: cool, i can understand now. anyway, with the 11:04 update, all system has not smooth graphics... either with radeon driver
 katorz: wait a second, please
 vibhav: so, if that happened to you, what would you do?
 vibhav: well, that f*** me a little, because with previous ubuntu my card was great
 katorz: tell me what happens, from the point you choose "Try ubuntu without install", until the point the desktop is loaded, please
 katorz: and the desktop, i supose, is the default gnome desktop... isnt it?
 katorz: have you considered intalling it? maybe from the live doesnt let you to install any nvidia drivers knowing you must reboot
 katorz: maybe a better way to test that is with virtualbox
 katorz: i agree with you. i've updated right now and i'm kinda f**** lol
 katorz: well, everything works. But graphics performance doesnt work much great. Not smooth.
 katorz: You're welcome. I'm sorry i couldn't help you much more. But i hate graphic drivers on ubuntu lol
 my graphics arent smooth with ubuntu 11.04, and they where on 10.10, with ATI latest driver. Why's that???
 areay: try intalling it with sudo apt-get install unity
 qkit: samba packages
 qkit: and then, on nautilus, press ctrl+l and write smb://
 areay: another option is ckeck if unity is activated on compiz settings
 yeah, but is dependency with unity package, so if it's installed, the option must be on compiz settings
