 frankcox777: what's wrong with your cable modem?
 frankcox777: that doesn't tell me much... :( you're just saying it works in one and not the other...
 frankcox777: is it getting an IP? do an  ifconfig and see if it has an IP.
 frankcox777: look at a working one and compare
 frankcox777: type my handle when you reply.. makes it easier to read
 frankcox777: do you know what the IP of the router is? usually it's something like 192.168.0.1... type ping and the ip of the router. see if that works.
 frankcox777: can you ping the ip of that same machine? in other words can the machine ping itself?
 frankcox777: ok.. also what IP does the machine have?
 frankcox777: what is it?
 frankcox777: that IP is a "loopback" address. it doesn't do anything :( you should get a 192 address usually
 frankcox777: when you do an ifconfig on the working pc you should see information for lo and eth0.. the lo is the loopback.. the eth0 is the actual interface. the eth0 is the one that we're concered with
 spthysis_: maybe it's a known problem.. did you do a search for your machine type and ubuntu ...
 frankcox777: ok, the system that assigns you an IP address is called dhcp... do a ps aux | grep dhcp  to see if dhclient is working on your pc
 frankcox777: hmm so all you're seeing when you run that is the ps command looking for dhcp.. that's common
 frankcox777: try   sudo /etc/init.d/networking stop  then   start
 frankcox777: hmm I was thinking maybe the network manager is not working... try  nm-applet  or  ps aux| grep nm-applet   to see if it's running
 frankcox777: you've already looked in that applet make sure you don't have network disabled or something weird like that
 nathan1111: it's a big learning curve. you either love it or hate it or learn to love it... i'm in the process of learning to love it...
 frankcox777: usually the nm-applet  is a little network icon on the task tray. right click on it and see if there is a checkmark next to wired network
 frankcox777: Enable Networking is checked?
 frankcox777: go in to the Edit Network connections on the  applet
 frankcox777: do you have anythnig in the "wired" tab?
 frankcox777: hmm click on it and then edit..
 frankcox777: is connect automatically checked?
 frankcox777: under IPv4 settings is Method: set to Automatic DHCP?
 frankcox777: ok... hmm remind me, when you do the ifconfig does it show you the eth0 settings and the lo settings or no eth0 settings at all?
 frankcox777: give me a sec
 frankcox777: is it a laptop? does it have wireless and wired on the pc that's having problems?
 frankcox777: hmm well the thing is that ifconfig shows an interface eth1 so my guess is that there is a config that's setup for eth0 but not eth1 for some reason
 frankcox777: it's not the drivers or the card in my opinion at least not at this point.. you see lights on the back where the card is plugged in right?
 frankcox777: usually those light up if they have a good link so maybe it is the card. If you pull the drive and put it in another pc you may have trouble with drivers that are not installed or misconfigured unless you have a similar or identical spare box
 frankcox777: yeah, check it out won't take long
 casey: I had a similar problem because of nvidia drivers.. would stay at the pink ubuntu screen and never get to the login.. do you have nvidia?
 casey: I had to boot in to recovery mode root with network.. then apt-get install linux-generic-headers  or  apt-get install linux-headers-generic
 casey: yeah, I read it in a bugreport.
 casey: no prob hope it helps
 bizerklurker_: You can try and reset your profile but it's kind of extreme and a little bit of work. at least it will fix the problem for sure
 rabbit_: ok
 bizerklurker_: I had to do it today after the upgrade :( ...
 frankcox777: cool.. so it is the NIC on that other pc
 bizerklurker_: go in to a command prompt and reset your root password first because you need to log in as root to do it.
 bizerklurker_: do a  "sudo su" put in your password
 bizerklurker_: now you are in as root...  type passwd <ENTER> and set the root password
 frankcox777: hmm usually that's just automatic
 bizerklurker_: sudo su   should not give you lots of output
 frankcox777: true that may eliminate the onboard NIC issue.. you should disable the NIC in the BIOS for the onboard if you're putting in a PCI one
 frankcox777: no prob
 bizerklurker_: give me a sec.. gotta put the kids to bed
 bizerklurker_: ok so if you reset the root password you'll have to do the following but you need to reboot to do it... write the next steps down
 bizerklurker_: reboot, when you're at the login screen press ctrl+alt+f1 ... that takes you in to a console/command window. log in with root.
 bizerklurker_:  do a  "cd /home"
 bizerklurker_: then  "mv your_folder your_folder.old" .. that renames your old profile folder but doesn't delete it. You can get your documents and other stuff back from it
 bizerklurker_: after you move it you have to create a new folder for your profile with   "mkdir your_folder" ... now give yourself permissions to it by "chown yourlogin:yourlogin your_folder" all three will be the same essentially..
 bizerklurker_: now you can exit out of the console and press alt+f7 to get back to the login screen. log in and if you did everything correctly you'll have a new profile like it was when you first installed ubuntu
 bizerklurker_: did you get all that?
 bizerklurker_: to retrieve your files you go to /home and you will see your_folder.old in there. you can copy/paste from it the documents you need
 bizerklurker_: ok, good luck.. BTW when you have a good profile... you can backup your   /home/your_folder  to /home/your_folder.backup ... then if you mess anything up you can revert back to a good backup
 bizerklurker: makes sense?
 KXTwo: I think it's just the Unity stuff that's throwing people for a loop.. learning curve. It's like everyone going from XP to 7.. everyone hates it because the interface is so different from the previous
 HealingDruid: I'd reinstall... upgrades usually never go well IMHO...
 HealingDruid: I'd say try the upgrade but be prepared to reinstall..
 HealingDruid: on ubuntu there are instructions on upgrade. you just have to change the settings in the package manager to see the upgrade and do a "check" then upgrade
 HealingDruid: oh, didn't know that. you may be able to recover from it somehow but at that point would you want to??
 HealingDruid: I wouldn't want to continue with a half upgraded system that got botched.. you should still be able to recover your files with an install CD by running ubunt off the cd
 GuyCanada: hmm check the keyboard maps, you may have a generic default set.. if you get one close to your laptop it may work.
 Geet: is it an old laptop?
 GuyCanada: keyboard>layout>keyboard model
 bizerklurker: yeah that's odd
 bizerklurker: are you sure the password you set is correct? try going through the steps we talked about before to make sure...  "sudo su" > "passwd" > enter new password
 GuyCanada: hmm not sure, is it nvidia?
 GuyCanada: I have to connect hdmi before I turn the pc on for it to work. can't do it hot...
 celthunder: ok will try.. I've always done it that way *shhrug*
 GuyCanada: I've always done it that way. just works best for me.. I assume it's something in the BIOS
 bizerklurker: yeah, scroll up. it looks like you didn't reset your root password properly.. I put the instructions back up
 bizerklurker: I'll paste again hold a sec
 bizerklurker: are you sure the password you set is correct? try going through the steps we talked about before to make sure...  "sudo su" > "passwd" > enter new password
 allowoverride: that pastebin didn't work
 beoyndcr: it's difficult to get used to and not intuitive.. I've been using it all day today and finally I'm getting used to it.
 beoyndcr: basically you can't scroll down menu like before. You have to type in what you need and then click on teh icon or type enough so that you can press enter and it will launch the right program
 beoyndcr: get used to pressing the windows key a lot...
 allowoverride: where is the good pastebin of the log?
 allowoverride: holy crackers batman!! what line are you talking about?
 maddie: hmm :( .. so you log in, set up your preferences like you like.. then it reverts back?
 allowoverride: yeah I see the squashfs errors under the temp dir...
 allowoverride: go to that directory and see if it's there..
 allowoverride: hmm yeah maybe you got the 64bit version for some reason ...
 allowoverride: also I was going to say (I've never done wubi but..) if there is a way to tell it where to put the squashfs try to put it somewhere else see if that works..
 allowoverride: I cheated and used tgz's :)
 allowoverride: I was going to say why use wubi in the first place but hey...
 allowoverride: oh so can't boot from CD?
 allowoverride: gotcha.. :)
 allowoverride: go for floppies ;) ...
 :(
 eventus: did it work before the upggrade?
 eventus: try ubuntu tweak and go to the compiz screen. install compiz plugin.
 eventus: then you can set it from the compiz config settings manager
 eventus: don't muck around with compiz too much though unless you have a backup of your home folder that you can revert to if you get everything hosed
 yuskhanzab: is it a key combination key like alt+f2 that messes you up?
 tanstaafl: I think it just keeps them there in the order they were added
 tanstaafl: remove and add in the right order :( ... I think I was able to drag them at one point in the beta but not working now
 tanstaafl: ok
 yuskhanzab: hmm I don't play warcraft in wine so I don't have any firsthand experience with this issue. just guessing... if you start notepad in wine and type do the letters that you type show up correctly?
 yuskhanzab: maybe wine is messed up and when you are sending a b c etc... it sees other UTF characters or ACSII stuff that shouldn't be going over..
 yuskhanzab: do you have any special settings in warcraft for keybindings? maybe try making everything as "default" as possible to see if it works then start customizing it.
 haroon: so the hardware switch is preventing wireless... it sounds like the question needs to be rephrased otherwise I would say just turn on wireless with the hardware switch.. need more info
 Linuxfav: does it hang on boot?
 Linuxfav: maybe reset your profile...
 Linuxfav: at least get it back to default
 Linuxfav: when you install a driver it's system wide, not just your profile.
  Linuxfav I'm not sure about jockey driver.
 jw_: /dev/sda is the more logical location.. the BIOS looks at the first ### blocks (don't know exactly) of the boot drive.. not in the first partition
 jw_: how many drives in the RAID? what RAID system are you using?
 jw_: it's been a long time since I've used RAID but usually putting the OS on a mirror of two drives and the data on a stripe with parity worked fine. Now with drives getting so big I hear striped with parity is not that great.
 warp_: why would you want to? if an upgrade craps out I'd reinstall and dump the upgrade
 Hotmedal Dr_Willis yes the cube kills Unity... confirmed :)
 kk9822: the regular ubuntu is for laptops there is a netbook version which is for small screen laptops "netbooks"
 ShiverOnBT4: try using "screen" even if the window is closed the console is open in the background..
 ShiverOnBT4: try using "screen" even if the window is closed the console is open in the background..
 Solnse: is it nvidia?
 Solnse: hmm I had the same thing but I have nvidia... I had to go in recovery mode and apt-get install linux-headers-generic.. then works fine
