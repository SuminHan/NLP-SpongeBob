 I have run "ssh -D 9998 user@server" (lucid server) on my desktop (natty), then set firefox proxy settings to localhost:9998 and network.proxy.socks_remote_dns to TRUE in the about:config on the desktop (natty), but I then can't access to the web, what's wrong in what I did ?
 Herbs, no, I didn't, how to do it ?
 Herbs, still here ?
 please, can someone help me to set ssh tunnelling with firefox, I can't manage to make it work, I always get a blank page in firefox, and tcpdump sees nothing related to the pages I'm trying to open with it
 bindi, yes, that's what I did
 bindi, ssh -D 9999 user@server
 bindi, it connects successfully
 bindi, yes
 bindi, sorry, it works...
 bindi, I've set localhost in the http line instead of the socks line
 bindi, thanks you very much!
 what tool should I use to set the desktop effects ?
 in natty
 it's not in appearance anymore
 and the compiz config tool is fucked up
 the new ubuntu sucks! Impossible to change/reset properly the desktop effects, even the Prt Screen key doesn't work anymore! I'm really fucked up
 Pici, yes, sorry
 Dr_Willis, I don't want unity, it's not convenient
 Dr_Willis, I use the normal gnome
 Dazzled1, why not for me then after my update then ?
 I'm so unhappy of this new version
 how to change/reset the desktop effect
 ?
 on the normal gnome environment ?
 is there a command line for that ?
 for this application
 Dr_Willis, reset compiz settings back to default
 Dr_Willis, that's to disable all effect or set it to default ?
