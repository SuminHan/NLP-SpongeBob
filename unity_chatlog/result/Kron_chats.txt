 dibs: I'm running Natty on a laptop with an NVIDIA card and a desktop with an ATI card. No problems on either.
 Belial`: Sounds like it's not recognizing your video card. You try installing restricted drivers maybe?
 Belial`: You might not be the only one: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers/+bug/770685
 litropy_: You sure it's enabled in the BIOS?
 Belial`: I understand wanting a clean install :)
 litropy_: I'm afraid my Bluetooth Dongle grew legs. I haven't played with it in Natty :/
 litropy_, hehe all my wireless keyboards are RF and the range is disappointing
 litropy_, Not sure if it will show up there, but you could try tail -f /var/log/dmesg and see if any events show up there?

 litropy_, You try restarting the bluetooth service?
 litropy_, Great!
