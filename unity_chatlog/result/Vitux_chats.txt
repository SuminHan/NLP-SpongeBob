 does anyone have experience with jackd?
 I installed guitarix/jackd the other day.. and ever since then I've got a weird echo on my sound
 nothing I do seems to remove it
 I've checked the forums
 heck I even uninstalled guitarix and jackd and makes no difference
 rhythmbox? :P
 lastoflast, whats wrong with rhythmbox/banshee?
 ic
 there's always xmms :\ sadly it's deprecated..
 dead
 which is too bad cause I always loved xmms
 hmm
 in that case I don't fully understand your issue
 I have no idea what playlist pane editor would mean then..
 can you be any more descriptive?
 eekTheCat, glad to know I'm not the only lost one :)
 hmm
 well you could do as I do.. throw everything in the library and make different playlists
 I can play any one song I want at a time
 I don't much use the playlists... I mostly just use the library
 lastoflast, it may be that my music collection isn't as vast as yours.. but I don't seem to be following you I think...
 lastoflast, terribly sorry I couldn't be of any help
 Canadian here :)
