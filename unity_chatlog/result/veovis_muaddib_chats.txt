 Sorry, decided to move this from #lubuntu - I just installed lubuntu and it detected my network during install, updated things, installed the restricted things, etc...  Then upon first boot DNS didn't work until I added my own nameservers in the system tray tool.  (DHCP Addresses only)  Then upon next boot I could only access my local network, but adding the proper gateway, switching to static IP, all don't work
