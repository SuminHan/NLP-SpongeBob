 so, anyone been able to use 11.04 inside virtualbox?
 so, installed 11.04 in virtualbox, installed guest additions, unity works, but the icons are huge and blocky and the text in the title bar is also huge and blocky.
 installed compizconfig-settings-manager, set icons to not grow,
 they look good. The text is still nasty. any ideas?
 patrunjel: mount -o loop disk1.iso /mnt/disk
 then you can access it like any other dvd
 patrunjel: yep. vlc is your best bet.
 RavenHursT: installed, took about 5 minutes for the main module to build.
 4 nines!
 RavenHursT: gui, but it's just running the command line anyway
 ChessTeach: sadly, with standard pc hardware, no dedicated raid card, software raid, you're looking at maybe 10% speed boost.
 RavenHursT: well, it took 20 minutes on my spare machine
 ChessTeach: yeah. A single SSD is going to blow away your array... if you don't need a ton of space, you can get a pretty fast ssd for 100$ or so
 so.... anyone have experience with graphical glitches in unity? still trying to sort out my absurd font issues
 iceroot: he's already said he has external backups, he knows the risks.
 iceroot: 4th time might be the charm. ;)
 iceroot: wish he'd read up on what he was trying to do before he just put the cowboy hat on, though.
 thevor: yep
 Wipster: install compizconfig-settings-manager, run ccsm, and disable the unity plugin. :)
