 <PetrHH>  Have you install it from a ubuntu repository
 <PetrHH>  I think the best way if really you need it??,  you install it from ubuntu or   debian repository
 <PetrHH> you can check it if it is in debian  go  to www.debian.org and search in packages
 <PetrHH>  in debian you have wvmare, I don't know if that you are looking for
 <PetrHH>  just add in your sources.list the line for debian   deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
