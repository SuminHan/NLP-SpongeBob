 Hello people, I'm trying to integrate ldap with samba and stumbling when trying to add the schema to ldap using: ldapadd -x -D cn=admin,cn=config -W -f /tmp/cn\=samba.ldif. I get the error: ldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)
 I installed openldap (or at least I think I did) using apt-get but there is no slapd.conf file in the /etc/ldap directory is this normal?
 can someone help me pls with openldap configuration pls? the slapd.conf file doesn't exist despite the fact that the daemon runs
 Psydoll: wine/virtualbox => windows => ubuntu :0
 kellnola: no such directory..
 kellnola: and I have installed slapd twice now
 anyon else? since kellnola has disappeared?
 Incarus6: I've installed slapd twice now and trying to configure it, and check the conf file for errors because I can't add schemas to openldap but it doesn't have a slapd.conf file as listed by the tutorials
 Incarus6: no it didn't change directory but according to the document it comes with a config file but I don't see any in it's directory
 maco: I grepped a .conf out of that just now and found just one file in the manual directory?
 Incarus6: it's a very complicated file to create and as it's supposed to have stuff in there that, when I read about, looks very complicated... Can't believe it's meant to be created by your average joe
 esp a beginner
 where do I add entries for the name resolution of other computers on my network? In my hosts file?
 or will samba auto add this for me?
 How can I find out the version of slapd running?
 DOes anyone know how to find out the version of the running openldap daemon?
 slapd
