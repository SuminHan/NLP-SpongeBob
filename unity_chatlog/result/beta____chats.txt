 does somebody here has knowledge how to compile a kernel?
 @ubottu, I want to use the latest kernel on 10.04
 because I don't like the new ubuntu 11.04, want to wait till 11.10 comes out..
 it fixes my wireless problems, and also some fixes to my Optimus supported laptop
 Oke, thanks for the help :)
 I will try Ubuntu 11.04, see that gnome2 is still there...
 An other question: I've used emerald as my decoration manager, is it posible to get it working in 11.04?
 hello, can someone help me? I'm having random 'freezes' with Ubuntu 11.04
 Goodnight all
