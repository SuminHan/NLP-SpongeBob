 I installed Ubuntu 11.4 using Wubi and when I booted into it, it says there is no boot partion. I uninstalled and it happened again. Any idea what could causing it
 it worke for my laptop but not my desktop
 ok
 did any one here go to LinuxFest Northwest over the weekend?
 get the owner a program called jaws for the netbook
 brb
 Well that didnt work. I just won't install Ubuntu right now. I redid the install with wubi for 10.10 and had the same problem.
 how do you fix "No root file system defined" After a install using Wubi?
 does Ubuntu work on RAID 0, and do I have to do anything to it to make it work? I was using WUBI to install but keep getting srros
 it's not "FakeRaid" and this computer is better with the e read bonus, not redundancy necessary. I just want to dual boot win7 and Ubuntu.
 ill okk at the vid, thanks
 dam, i cant type today
 unfortunately I wouldn't know how to do that without messing it up. The problem is i keep getting an error sayingno root file system. but it works with the laptop fine
