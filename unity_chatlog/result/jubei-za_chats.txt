 Evildaemon, you could manually reassign your ip setup on network interface to have no default gateway or dns server. You can also use iptables firewall but this is quite complicated.
 you want your wireless interface to have network communication, but not out to the internet - then you would edit ipconfig of wan0 or somthing like this
