 I just upgraded to Natty from Mav. I'm digging the new unity interface, but I'm wondering if I am still able to use panel applets on the top panel without switching back to the Gnome gui?

 cousin_mario What?
 cousin_mario Do what?
 Cousin_Mario well I've only been using it for less than an hour so far. I'm liking it. I just need to know if i can use panel applets still. I'm on battery power and I can't find the applet to let me change my processor speed so my battery is draining faster.
 cousin_mario and I also can't find force quit
 cousin_mario: Oh, and when I want to switch between windows I can't use Super + Tab to switch between them with the fancy animation that was in Mav.
 Dr_Willis properly disabled?
 Dr_Willis so the super + tab animation won't work with Unity?
 Dr_Willis Then I'll check out ccsm and use a different key combination. Thanks.
 Dr_Willis I just tried an apt-get for ccsm and terminal told me it was unable to locate

 Someone on here just suggested that I install ccsm. This is what I got in terminal: http://paste.ubuntu.com/602449/
