 ruum: the new DE seems bugged to me, otherwise no problems so far
 ruum: isn't maximized windows a feature now?
 ruum: I'm not using the new DE, but I think I remember that
 ruum: yes, I think that is a feature, more Mac OS X-ish
 ruum: you can still use Ubuntu Classic
 ruum: AFAIK that is Gnome
 ruum: well then, use GNOME if you like it better
 ruum: my prefered wm is the Awesome Window Manager
 ruum: just don't use the new desktop!!
 ruum: I've said it, pick Ubuntu Classic when you log in, it's just like back in 10.x
