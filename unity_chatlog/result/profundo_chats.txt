 no, unity is
 Hi, I am trying to update to ubuntu 11.04 from 10.10 and the update manager is freezing up and then saying to check my internet connection. it's only doing this for the distro update, other updates are fine. Anyone know why that might be? thanks
 no ideas?
 I am trying to upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 but the update manager is pausing and then saying I need to check that I am connected to the internet. Is it possible to upgrade manually?
 oh right, thank you
 I have just upgraded to 11.04 and on unity there are no toolbars anywhere, I just see a desktop. Moving the mouse to the edges of the screen doesn't do anything. I am using an nvidia 8600M GT. Is this a known problem?
 oh right, I have rebooted quite a few times, but still not seeing it
 Braiam: I am on ubuntu classic now and that works fine. But it would be nice to be able to use unity
 zarathaz: should it not be ./test rather than ./test.cpp
 not ./test.cpp, just ./test
 you made the output file test didn't you? with -o test
 zarathaz: no prob
