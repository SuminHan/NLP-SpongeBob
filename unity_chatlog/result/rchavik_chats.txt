 hi, a quick question, to upgrade 10.10 to 11.04 via CD, i can only use the alternate iso file. is that correct?
 zepherin, upgrade process not smooth ?
 zepherin, okay.. thanks for the heads-up! i will wait then.
 lcb, yes.. but i can't spare my laptop now, i'll wait until my load cools down a bit..
 lcb, thanks for the pointer.. will take note.
 lcb, now downloading the alternate iso so hopefully i can do it in the weekends..
 lcb, no, upgrade from 10.10 -> 11.04
