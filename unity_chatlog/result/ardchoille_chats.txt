 Is there a known issue with nautilus not respecting themes in 11.04?
 coz_: Ah, ok, thanks. I designed my own GTK themes and it's not accepting any of them, nor is it respecting default themes.
 coz_: It isn't respecting the default themes like Clearlooks, Ambiance, Dust or Radience either. Maybe due to upgrading instead of a fresh install.
 coz_: I did a network upgrade. I have had my custom themes installed for about a year and they work fine in gnome 2.x UI
 coz_: I went back to the gnome 2.x UI via login screen, it's all good. I don't like having to move my mouse just to use menus anyway.
 coz_: ah, ok, will try the update/upgrade again
 coz_: nothing to upgrade, it looks like it was complete
 coz_: yes, and my themes were working yesterday in gnome 2.x and still work today. But nautilus doesn't respect them in Unity
 coz_: correct, other apps are fine in Unity
 coz_: how much trouble would I cause myself to try an uninstall/reinstall of nautilus?
 coz_: kk, thank you
 velory: you need to put an item in starup programs for guake
 velory: System > Preferences > Start up Applications
 velory: hmm.. I don't know, never messed with those
 velory: I seem to remember that being an option within guake, try the guake settings
 coz_: Ah, good to know. I'll try a fresh install of 11.04 next week. Thank you very much for the info :)
 coz_: I think I am going to buy a cd or dvd from shop.canonical.com, I like to support Ubuntu as much as possible.
 coz_: That small?! Nice. You have a good point
 coz_: kk
 coz_: I don't have any blank media ATM, will buy some in a few days. Thanks though :)
 coz_: may I pm you?
 slashnames: Please don't highlight people like that
