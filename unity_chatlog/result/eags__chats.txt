 H, question about indicator applet for Unity:  I've upgrade 3 laptops and Skype shows up for 2.  In third case it is definitely running but I don't see it in the panel.  I've tried different themes.  Anyone know what the deal is?  I checked if it was in the whitelist and it definitely is.    Anyone have any ideas??
 Anyone know about why skype isn't appearing in the indicator area?
 Anyone know about why skype isn't appearing in the indicator area?  Works fine on two other natty upgrades I did.
 HI, anyone know about why skype isn't appearing in the indicator area?  Works fine on two other natty upgrades I did.   I did try Unity from a ppa in Maverick so maybe I messed up some settings?  any way to reset Unity only configs?
 beatpanic: you can't see Skype under ubuntu classic?  That is strange since classic gnome still has the Notification area.
 vibhav: do you know why skype isn't appearing in the indicator area?  Works fine on two other natty upgrades I did.   I did try Unity from a ppa in Maverick so maybe I messed up some settings?  any way to reset Unity only configs?

 Omega: ^
 vibhav: --reset will clear my settings or just restart unity?
 I just ran unity-preferences out of curiosity.  Funny.
 vibhav, Omega: is this a unity setting or an Indicator applet setting?
 yeah it is running
 dios_mio: lol.  A lot of people don't agree though.
 vibhav: yeah, so I haven't reset unit yet because it seems like it isn't about unity, it is about indicator applet.
 vibhav:  gsettings != gconf?  When did that happen?  Is there no gui for browsing these settings or do I just have to know they exist?
 Omega: not in repo.  ??
 Omega: it isn't.  And it isn't in apt.  Are you spelling it correctly?
 Omega:  got it.  thanks.
 Omega, vibhav: if you look around in dconf-editor do you see any relevant keys for indicator applet I might be missing?  I only have the whitelist setting which looks fine.
 Omega, vibhav: ok, unity --reset did not work but I did get some interesting info in my console: ** (<unknown>:6574): DEBUG: TrayChild Rejected: dropbox dropbox Dropbox
 ** (<unknown>:6574): DEBUG: TrayChild Rejected: (null) HipChat HipChat
 ** (<unknown>:6574): DEBUG: TrayChild Accepted: (null) skype Skype
 got it, sorry
 Omega, vibhav: anyway, it looks like Indicator is correctly accepting Skype and rejecting others as per the default whitelist.  But it still isn't visible.
 Omega, vibhav: restarting skype didn't work.  Here is my console output since resetting unity.  Notice that Skype is accepted twice, the second time is when I restarted it so it appears to be working but maybe some of this other output is interesting:  https://gist.github.com/950552
 Omega, figured it out.  It is actually a dual head bug.
 Omega: I noticed when I showed all my desktops that I could actually see the notification icons way up in the middle of nowhere by themselves.   Also notification applets don't get copied to the other head
 Omega: yeah but just by working around it.
 Omega: I just arranged my screens so the top of my main monitor is aligned with the top of my second monitor.  Before I had the top of my second, larger monitor higher than my main monitor creating some empty space above the main monitor.  That is where the notification applets are being drawn.
 Omega: super hacky solution but whatever.  Anyway looks like Ubuntu is putting minimal effort into supporting older apps.  Especially given the whole whitelist thing.  Are all other DE on board with indicator as the way forward?  Are KDE and gnome apps going to support this?
 Omega: anyway, thanks for your help.  I'll file a bug.
