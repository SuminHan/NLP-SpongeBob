 scialen: did you boot from USB too or is it a CD?
 Veloce06: unetbootin
 Veloce06: I'm going to format it again...
 Veloce06: I will try now.. gparted is rnning
 Veloce06: my unetbootin is running :) let's see..
 How do I install xfce 4.8 on natty? I already installed a shitload of apps before finding out that unity just doesn't run at all for me
 jiohdi, if xfce works.. can i also remove all gnome shizzle?
 jiohdi: i guess it's safe to remove gnome-shell? I tried installing it, but not much luck either
 is there a way to reset all gnome settings? I accidently did something wrong (disabled too many compiz effects) and now unity wont start
 coz_ unity won't start.
 typhoon: thanks
 coz_ no xfce. I installed both xfce and gnome shell
 coz_ yes probably. compositing didn't work with my graphics driver (ATI), so i accidently disabled it
 coz_ hmm.. fair point. It rather seems that unity breaks gnome shell
 lmao
 coz_ give me 5 minutes
 is it recommended to throw away unity & install gnome-shell? Or does it not work optimal on natty?
 rofl
 Logan_ that would just give me gnome 2, with gnome-shell I mean gnome 3
 ubottu thanks
 taglass: I agree to some degree.. except that I can still do my work in gnome3, whilst unity is making that impossible.
 taglass: if i want to be productive i'd better just get another distro..
 ZykoticK9: i wouldn't choose debian as a desktop env
 lgp171188 what should i choose if im sick of gnome2 atm (its getting boring) & i don't want kde? (or give me one good reason for kde)
 Logan_ this would be achieved just with apt-get install xfce4? But im not sure if this installs the last version 4.8
 lgp171188 let me google lxde
 lgp171188: thanks. i might install xfce for now and tweak it.. i just want something that is not counterproductive
 Scarra3 install ati driver on your own risk! it depends on your computer..
 Scarra3 on my pc when using ATI driver, compositing doesn't work anymore, which is a key feature used in unity compiz
 Scarra3 in other words: it might be that your compiz is screwed
 Scarra3: I have ATI mobility Radeon HD 3650; I would recommend just trying. Go back if something feels sloppy for you
 Grimdin: good to know; i thought this problem only existed with ATI
 joako: get a torrent program like vuze, transmission Âµtorrent, and download it.
 Grimdin: i don't have a clue.. i had this problem before, not just on natty. I think it is a driver related problem
 Braiam: I am suggesting it because he might be on windows, and that program is easier
 Braiam: hence why it was my last suggestion.
 joako: you weren't expecting from canonical here were you? I'm just trying to help.
 joako: that was not really in your description; from what you said it sounded like you didn't know what torrents are..

 Hi, i'm using my music library that is on my NTSF partition. In rhythmbox it loads all songs, in any other musicplayer it doesn't, anyone got an idea?
 Hi, i'm using my music library that is on my NTSF partition. In rhythmbox it loads all songs, in any other musicplayer it doesn't, anyone got an idea?
 hi, I try to load my music library into clementine from an NTFS partition, though roughly half of the songs are not being imported.. But they are visible in rhythmbox
 ohsix that's what im trying. Weird thing is, that i think clementine is not the only player having issues with it.
 ohsix i should try.. but i'm pretty sure I reimported my library several times in rhythmbox.
 ohsix im now copying them, and i'll import in both clementine & rhythmbox
 ohsix: thanks for the tip, but i just reinstalled maverick ;)
 ohsix: thanks for the tip but i just reinstalled :)
 ohsix: I tried importing my library in rhythmbox clementine and exaile
 ohsix: rhythmbox=3772, clementine=2650,exaile=around 2300
 ohsix: i already thought of that: there are some flac and ogg in there, but not up to 1K
