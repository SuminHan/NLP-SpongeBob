 When I startup my computer (Which is using Windows and Ubuntu side-by-side, Windows being installed first) theres an option to press F11 which goes into System Recovery, this worked before when I just had Windows by itself, but I want to do another reformat because of the new Ubuntu, how can I fix this?
 Whole hard drive
 It's awesome. ;3
 Excited for Unity, at first I was like eh, but it looks cool. :D
 But theres another HDD in there, and it has the system covery for Windows Vista on it..
 HP (HDD)
 FACTORY_IMAGE (HDD)
 the factory image is on the same HDD i think.
 so i can't wipe it all, then i'll have no windows :/
 I can't wipe the hole HDD because the factory default of Windows Vista is on the same HDD, I need to be able to enter the System Recovery application when I start up my computer, it normally works with F11 and goes straight into it, but with Ubuntu side by side with Windows; that selection of what OS just shows up.
 I still have the option to press F11 on the start up screen, but doesn't work.
 like i said, just goes straight to the OS selection
 I've tried pressing F11, then selecting Windows Vista on the OS selection, but just goes to the Windows log-in screen like normal

 "But as stated, the F11 is gone, because when you installed Ubuntu, GRUB overwrote the MBR section where the F11 is launched. You learned a hard lesson :(" -.-'
 O.O
 I can't access the System Recovery though..
 Chat timed out, missed what you said.
 Starminn: I typed sudo fdisk -l into terminal and two parts of my HP HDD came up, /dev/sda2           59465       60801    10739452+   7  HPFS/NTFS and /dev/sda1   *           1       34786   279415295+   7  HPFS/NTFS
 I have 2 different options to boot into Vista at the OS selection, never tried sda2 though, and the factory image is like 10GB, is that it?
 should i try booting into sda2?
 Theres also 3 more..
 -.-
 i'll try boot into sda2, if no luck i'll come back, thanks :D
 I'll just get some asian guy that can't even speak english. D:
 brb

 So here's my problem, I have a 500GB HDD, and at first I only had Windows on it, then I installed Ubuntu 10.10 a few months ago and had both OS's side-by-side, and I used the Windows (HP) Recovery Manager today to reformat my HDD so I started clean with a fresh install of Windows and a 500GB HDD, and was planning on installing Ubuntu 11.4 side-by-side with Windows again, but when I reformatted it only reformatted the 250GB's of the W
 Windows and Ubuntu 11.4 on the other 250GB HDD, how do I fix this...?
 knick, I tried that but only had the option of 250GB's, which is how much space I gave the Windows partion last time..
 It's like the reformat only reformatted the Windows partion and not the Ubuntu as well.
 I did...
 I have 6 partitions..
 1. HP 200 GB NTFS 2. 83 GB ext4 3. 3.2 GB Swa... 32 GB 4. Extended 289 GB (Pretty sure this is Ubuntu 10.4 parition) 5. 195 GB ext4 6. 8.3 GB Swap ... 8.3 GB 6. FACTORY_IMAGE 11GB NTFS
 2 is partition type Linux, so is 3, 5 and 6, HP and FACTORY_IMAGE are both partition type HPFS/NTFS (0x07) and 4, is partition type Extended if this helps..
 I want to clean out all of the Linux ones, can someone help me?
 So theres only HP and FACTORY_IMAGE left.
 D:
 no help?
 what's it do?

 Does gparted have an interface when I boot to it using a LiveCD?
 I'm not good with commands :/

 Thanks!
 BlouBlou, what happens If I need to unmount to delete the partitions

 But how do I unmount it when I'm in the gparted liveCD, or wont i need to worry about that?
 :D

 I have deleted the unwanted partitions and now I have my Windows partition which is /dev/sda1 and the FACTORY IMAGE which is /dev/sda2, but when I try to boot it says, error: no partition and under it is gnub rescue> or something..
 i need to boot into /dev/sda2..

 I have deleted my Ubuntu partitions, and only have my Windows partition and my factory_image partition, I'm currently using Ubuntu from the LiveCD and I need to boot into /dev/sda2 but I can't do it with GRUB because it says "error: no partition.. grub rescue>"

 Well, I came here to ask a question, theres another audio application out there thats like PulseAudio and starts with an a, anyone know what it's called..

 Adjust volume(s) in Ubuntu
 It's more complex then the standard stuff.
 :3
 Thanks!
 What do I type to get alsamixer in the terminal again -.-
 sudo apt-get alsamixer?
 :O
 It's already installed. >:)
 It's a setting I've got to change when I make a new install of Ubuntu; that's all. :3
 So my Xbox 360 sound can stream through my PC and into my headphones, along with mic.
 11.4 scared me at first, but I'm starting to like it. :3
 If you don't like Unity just switch to Ubuntu classic..
 -.-'
 Anyone know how to enable the new scrollbars in Firefox?
 Is it just me or when I select to keep launchers in Unity 3D (Ubuntu 11.4) they don't stay there when reboot?
 How do I add a custom launcher to Unity 3D (Ubuntu 11.4) and have an icon for the launcher as well?

 What's that Ubuntu torrent application with the blue raindrop logo? I forgot what it's called. :'(
 Thanks!
 Is 11.4 called Natty? I forgot.
 D:
 Thank you. ;3
 I think they should have done more work towards Unity before releasing it, seems as though they just ported it straight from the desktop version. :/
 notebook version.*
 Is there an application out there that lets you Right-click an application, let's say Minecraft.jar, and theres an option to create minecraft.desktop with all the information I need inside of that file to drag it into Unity?
 I'm trying to use a launcher to launch minecraft.jar, and I just put this as the command in the launcher "/home/vustom/Vustom/Ubuntu/Games/minecraft.jar" without the quotes, but when I try to open Minecraft using the launcher it doesn't work?
 so.. "java -jar /home/vustom/Vustom/Ubuntu/Games/minecraft.jar"?
 That worked, thanks. ;3
 Unity is actually pretty cool once you fix it all up to suit your style. :D
 One last thing, I've removed Evolution and installed Thunderbird, I've installed the thunderbird applicator but it only shows up within that mail icon when it's already launched, how can I add a link there to launch Thunderbird like there is for Pidgin?
 I don't seem to have the "Open with..." option when right clicking things in Ubuntu 11.4.. any idea how to fix this?
 For example, like a .desktop extention.
 Is anyone else having trouble checking their Update Manager? I get "Check your internet connection." but my internet is just fine.
 What Ubuntu desktop recorder is this guy using..? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MhJB9yC7Bo
 I want it. :D
 Where can I find that folder in the Ubuntu directory that has all the launchers for my currently installed applications?
 no help? D:
 There in a folder, I went there before but forgot how to get back. D:
 nvm
 got it.
 gksu nautilus /usr/share/applications
 :D
 Where do I go to select Deluge when I choose to Open with.. when downloading a .torrent file in Firefox?
