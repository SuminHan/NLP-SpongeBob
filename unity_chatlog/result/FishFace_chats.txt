 GarryFre: Just wondering since I had the same problem, how video memory do you have?
 GarryFre: OK. Thanks. Mine was much lower
 uberfrau: uberfrau Just a guess. Did you do it as root?
 uberfrau: Cant help you much on that. If you are root and you do the make , make install blah blah, and it doesn't work, then something is broken. Good luck on that.
