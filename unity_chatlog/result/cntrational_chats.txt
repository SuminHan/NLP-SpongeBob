 my resolution is set to 1024x768, when it's supposed to be set to 1368x768. what do I do?
 carandraug: it's not there, that's the problem
 carandraug: Ubuntu isn't detecting the proper resolution
 carandraug: that's on 11.10, afaik
 I've tried editing xorg.conf, but I'm not sure what I need to do to set the resolution
 carandraug: as ohsix said, it isn't there
 carandraug: already tried that, it fails with the error "Number of created screens does not match number of detected devices"
 carandraug: yes
 carandraug: I did do that; alt-ctrl-F2, sudo stop service gdm
 carandraug: http://pastebin.com/YbK35Uy1
 carandraug: 1368x768, a 16:9 resolution
 so
