 whats a fast mirror? (downloading with 60k atm and i dont think its my connection)
 found a fast mirror (university of kent)
 is it just me or this unity is horrible? :)
 Dr_Willis, i know, but I its just not me (i dont like macos). Do you know when can we expect an ubuntu version that comes with gnome3?
 Dr_Willis, why do you think so? Are they planning to move to unity and leave gnome?
 Dr_Willis, yeah I know that. Unity is more suitable for netbooks with small screens. I hope they still keep supporting the gnome3 shell too.
 guys do you know of software (like logmein, teamviewer, easypcgate) to login remotely to an ubuntu machine (without real ip)?
 Dr_Willis, didnt know that. Thank you very much
 guy, my touchpad is not working properly - it moves the cursor to random places and randomly clicks/rightcliks (using acer aspire & ubuntu 11.04)
