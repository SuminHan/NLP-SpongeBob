 does the ubuntu installer erase home during the install?
 Dr_Willis: now I will put home on a separate partition
 thanks
 PresuntoRJ: single partition for ubuntu unfortunately
 also, unity seems very laggy, especially with launching applications. Is that intended?
 PresuntoRJ: right! thanks
 another question: launching firefox takes about 2-3 seconds. Is that normal?
 this is with unity
 to open firefox
 the icon blinks for 2-3 seconds. and then it runs reasonably fast. I did a 10.04 -> 10.10 -> 11.04 upgrade. I suspect I need to do a fresh install

 PresuntoRJ: its bearable I agree. Its not as fast as 10.04 though.
 PresuntoRJ: if this is expected, I can avoid a clean install. Thanks
 PresuntoRJ: yeah. Im looking for configs which used to be in obvious places with gnome, unity is completely different
 PresuntoRJ: got it! thanks!
 Dr_Willis: as a form of punishment for something?
 unity.launcher forgets that it has running instances of google-chrome and launches new ones every time.
 Ubuntu classic saved my day
 cebrian: logout and choose ubuntu classic from the toolbar below before loging in
 cebrian: hrm... so you arent able to run X?
 cebrian: are you using an nvidia graphics card by any chance?
 hypetech: you take that back!
 mithridates: nope. ubuntu classic saved the day for me
 mithridates: I would've been fine with unity if they hadnt broken Alt+F2.
 mithridates: DosAmp: various things. it wont complain if you've entered something non-existing. it doesnt autocomplete
 mithridates: plus it laggy
 Guest68448: can you mount the mp4 player as a mass storage device?
 Guest68448: what do you mean by seeing the files but not the contents?
 Guest68448: can you open it and see the contents?
 snowrichard: at it takes a bit more time for you to want to rip your eyes out
 Guest68448: tried pasting the mp4 files directly into a folder on the mp4 player that looks like "music/audio" ?
 Guest68448: you would be missing a package if you're talking about missing codecs. Although I dont see how missing a codec will prevent you from transfering files to the player
 Guest68448: gnokii?
