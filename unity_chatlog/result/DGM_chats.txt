 ubuntu 11 64 bit hangs on installing ubiquity (could not find module nvidia and more of those), clean install.. couldn't find any bugs that completely describe the problem. Any ideas?
 happyface: while installing ubiquity it just spams with could not found module and then just hangs
 Samsagax: amd phenom 2 x6 1090T, 4 gb ram, nvidia gtx 295
 Samsagax: it complains about more modules then just nvidia.. it's almost like it can't find any at all
 Samsagax: after waiting for ages on the setup i desided to look at why it was stopping.. and it was stuck on that missing module line while installing "ubiquity"
 Samsagax: i'm still in the setup though... it hasnt even fully installed yet
 Samsagax: but all i did was insert the usb stick, picked what partition it should all go to, and hit install.. and then poof. it even wrecked my grub but i managed to get that back up through a live cd
 Samsagax: yep ofc
 Samsagax: i have a /, a 4 gb swap and some ntfs'es for windows
 Samsagax: funny thing is, when i look through bug reports, they say its either fixed last month, or say they're a duplicate of a bug that looks nothing like what is described xD
 Samsagax: you could set up a 32 chroot, that worked fine for me :)
 bit*
 Samsagax: ye, disappointing :) oh well. I guess i'll use windows for a while hehe
 Samsagax: missing lib or something? What's the error it gives?
 wazzup: from or on?
 Samsagax: hm did you install those deps in your chroot though?
 Samsagax: ah ok, ye i didnt have any problems running 32 bit stuff either, but i had to compile 32 bit libs at some point so i made a 32 bit chroot for that following this guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575 . You can just use apt in there. It's a bit of a hassle to switch to that chroot to run whatever you need to though.. and it takes up a lotta space too
 Samsagax: hehe ye
 Samsagax: i guess it says 32 bit recommended for a reason :P
 i'm just gonna go to bed.. when i wake up tomorrow all the problems will be solved.. probably.. maybe.. hopefully
 nite
