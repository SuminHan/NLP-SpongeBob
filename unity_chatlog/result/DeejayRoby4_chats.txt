 @ohsix not true  @PythonPup Maverick is working
 PythonPup, maverick works correctly
 PythonPup, yes, the release version
 PythonPup, it is a fresh install
 PythonPup, I can't it's elementary os and still I could not, because I just rewrote the partition table

 PythonPup, now? http://oi51.tinypic.com/2elwlma.jpg
 PythonPup, you do not understand the problem, I can not click ok
 PythonPup nothing appears if I click ok!!
 PythonPup I've done it!!
 PythonPup, I've troed that and it did not work
 PythonPup, I've tried*
 PythonPup, I can try this way but the install is not completed!
 PythonPup, maybe I've figured out the problem! could be because I use a nvidia raid 0?
 PythonPup, what can i do for install?
 PythonPup, i've done it
 PythonPup, no, I can't, later, I want to install windows in dual boot mode and in any case the hardware raid is faster
 PythonPup, I do not think I understand, the raid is done entirely on the chipset
 PythonPup, a 980a chipset
 PythonPup, at this moment I can't buy anything
 PythonPup, What should I do to make a software raid
 PythonPup, so if I make a raid software will work only on Linux?
 PythonPup, I do not want space. I want speed, especially on Windows because I play
 PythonPup, you're right, maybe expect too .... Well think about and decide
