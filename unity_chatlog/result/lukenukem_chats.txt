 Hey, can someone help me with a problem with Natty Narwhal?
 Cool! So, I've just upgraded from 10.10 (I guess) to NN. After installing and restarting I can still move the mouse thingy but the rest is frozen.
 Is there anything I can do?
 ojii, I tried your first suggestion and I got the message: unable to open x display
 ojii, okay, thanks for helping, anyway. :)
