 hi, i have some problems isntallin an i386 program ona 64bit ubuntu
 anyone knows how to get i386 libs to work in a 64bit?
 cassio: just right click on the switcher > preferences
 45
 cassio: U mean in unity? you just can't
 cassio: I'm using natty too, got another problem with i386 programs, but in Gnome (Classic ubuntu) you can change the 2x2 to 1x4 grid
 cassio: my advice: don't use unity
 cassio: in unity you can't change almost nothing
 cassio: but is just my oppinion
 Need some help: can't install a i386 application on my 64bit ubuntu natty
 stefg: got it, but just won't install
 stefg: done that, it says i need some dependencies, i installed them and got the same message again
 stefg: won't install even with force-all
 aguitel: you shouldn't if you use unity
 no one can help me?
 DGM: your machine?
 DGM: then is not an hybrid graphics problem
 DGM: blacklist nouveau
 DGM: and check the xorg.conf
 DGM: ohh.. i think you should install with no drivers and then install the drivers, is safer that way
 DGM: im wondering why the Xorg Propietary drivers testing stopped ad week 3
 typhoon: I know but natty is still not as stable as it should be
 DGM: strange
 DGM: did you check the "format" option in the / mount?
 DGM: just as me, i don't know what is happening to you. Try to install again witout networ
 anyone can help me about i386 apps in amd64 architecture
 ?
 DGM: as i've said, natty is not as stable as it should be
 DGM: tried that... didn't work
 DGM: use maverick, it is good as it should be
 DGM: gives an error about missing dependencies, i have the dependencies installed, but it just keeps telling me that i dont
 DGM: how can i know for sure?
 DGM: funny thing is i had this app installed on averick w/o anything else than ia32-libs
 DGM: is like having a second OS
 is there a way to get ANY applet working in unity?
 cdavis: still there is a problem with 32bit libs
 Galerien: go to releases.ubuntu.com
 Galerien: and use the bit torrent, others are just jammed
