 folks, I just installed gnome3. It works but the default adwaita gtk theme is not there. It's not available in gnome-tweak-tool interface tab. And as a result all is ugly (redmond theme). How can I install adwaita?
 i tried installing redis-server i386 on my amd64 system (with dpkg --force-architecture). It failed, but now I can't install normal redis-server, as it thinks i386 is installed. I can't uninstall it, as it doesn't find such a package. The error is as follows        redis-server: 2:2.2.5-1 (Multi-Arch: no) is not co-installable with redis-server:i386 2:2.2.5-1 (Multi-Arch: no) which is currently installed
