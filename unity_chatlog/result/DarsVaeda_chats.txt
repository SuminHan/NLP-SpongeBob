 hi is anyone familiar with where firefox 4 youtube temp files are saved to?
 in older versions there was a flv temp file generated for each video you watched in /tmp - can not find that anymore
 VCoolio: thx i pretty much think that will help :)
 how do i uninstall gnome3 and reinstall unity or at least gnome2 on ubuntu 11.04?
 how do i revert back to unity after installing gnome3?
 i do not want to fresh install -.-
 there must be a different solution
