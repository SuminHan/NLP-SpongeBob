 hello, im trying to ubuntu 10.10 32bit on a windows xp laptop. when i boot to cdrom, windows xp continues to rule the mbr. how can i load linux on this laptop the best practice way, that will work 100% of the time. thanks  also, it seems older hardware doesnt allow the cdrom to pass xp boot usually,, at least the past 4 boxes i have tried....
 i have not... however, it is set to boot from cdrom currently
 i have tried the basics, it should just start the install... sighs...

 usb not an option
 netboot not an option, no pxe
 cdrom boots, verified by disabling hd with switch+1 on pheonix bios set up
 n3glv: oh?
 n3glv: i think its a bios proprietary issue,,, maybe your right, can you help assist in trbshting?
 ActionParsnip: the cd boots right up when hd is disabled in bios
 ActionParsnip: that should answer that
 ActionParsnip: furthermore, i have tried multiple os, cd's, burn speeds so forth...
 ActionParsnip:  xp will only load on this, and also, oh.. um
 ActionParsnip: there is cdrom, hd, net, floppy, thats it
 ActionParsnip: toshiba satellite, an older one, prolly with usb 1.0 ports
 brb
 n3glv: one moment ok,,, ActionParsnip for a second
 ActionParsnip: 3005-s307, part# ps302u-019xdx
 ActionParsnip: im not that fast
 n3glv: explain. thanks
 there is no usb boot option in bios
 ActionParsnip: agrees
 i have the right os
 ActionParsnip: ill wait, thanks...
 ok
 ActionParsnip: ok, ill try that... that might be it..
 ActionParsnip: ok, no sata option, also, at boot i press <C> to force boot cdrom, xp splash still loads...
 ActionParsnip:  no usb option
 ActionParsnip: i am wondering if i need to make a usb 1.0/1.1 boot disk and try that... maybe it will show up as a HD
 n3glv: i tried usb install first before cd, usb first then cd always for me
 im wondering if i should try a usb 1.0 flash drive, since this an oldddd laptop
 i need a tool set of disks/usbs/1.0/2.0 it seems to have any luck with installing ubuntu on any box sighs...
 n3glv: im done with the basics, i need the work around
 F2
 n3glv: nope, been there done that,, your right, but im past that stage
 this is the second laptop i have had an issue with the past month for a customer
 n3glv: have you used freebsd? that wouldnt even allow me to load it
 im pretty sure this is a bios hardware issue or something proprietary
 n3glv:  well,,, its improved since then lol
 anyway, im gonna try to find a usb 1.0 next... ill be back
 and also the #hardware room suggested i upgrade the bios .. typical
 just a heads up, the last box i did, i even did a zero the drive with a maxtor 4.0 disk,,, that did not fix the issue
 n3glv: regarding your mbr fix
 how can i tell if i have a 1.0 or 2.0 usb stick plugged in? whats the command
 wow this room is way to busy,,, l8
 question - i would like to know why exactly why 8.04 LTS loaded successfully while 10.10 did not on an older laptop. could someone enlighten me?
 took 2 days to finally get install of Linux on a laptop
 RavenHursT: is mount.whatever actually there?
 RavenHursT: i dont know if you know, but you need to create the Directory first, then mount to it :)
 RavenHursT: are you working with VirtualBox?
 RavenHursT: in cmdline only? i know its a pain sometimes, however, it works well if you get the syntax working right. what are you trying to do? explain? we know your mounting, but Vbox should already see those mounts once fired up. are you doing Headless ?
 k
 RavenHursT: are you doing a headless type solution? multiple users to log into it over the network? or what..
 RavenHursT: with out a monitor, and accessable across the net, its an industry standard term ;)
 RavenHursT: i have a similar set up on my laptop for smb and vbox stuff. im trying to remember the syntax... ill look around my history files. bbiab
 RavenHursT: thats not my syntax, thats the default explanation lol
 RavenHursT: since your in cmdline, may i suggest you check out this howto: http://www.howtoforge.com/vboxheadless-running-virtual-machines-with-virtualbox-2.0-on-a-headless-ubuntu-8.04-server  , the syntax is priceless, however, its an older version of vbox, BUT it will give you a few clues as to what else you may have forgotten, ok?
 np
 RavenHursT: also, here is the manual, good reading :) http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads#manual
 RavenHursT: opps. http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.0.6/UserManual.pdf

 jpohl: uname -a
 jpohl: shutdown -r now
 jpohl: you can goto terminal by pressing cntr-alt-F2, then logging in an executing those commands..
 jpohl: looks like you may have a bad byte somewhere, thats too bad. i recently had a question, why an older version of ubuntu desktop installed fine, while 10.10 and 11.x did not.
 sgaap: my eyes burned trying to decipher that last sentence

 forevertheuni: those are the options for...?
 oh. you mean in login splash?
 forevertheuni: your asking what they all do?
 failsafe?
 forevertheuni: are you able to login?
 forevertheuni: so you you select the default top option, you log in, then it kicks you to cmdline, correct?
 your X server is not starting properly, pastebin your dmesg or tail 50 /var/log/messages
 forevertheuni: so your able to log in,,, correct? whats the issue then...
 forevertheuni: do you not want to goto kde
 forevertheuni: thats a little tricky, and you may have to remove some .hidden files to get it back
 forevertheuni: so you have both kde and gdm running your X server.
 forevertheuni: stand by
 forevertheuni: yah that combo isnt the best way to do it
 forevertheuni: kde and gdm have come a long way, however, running them both to run each other desktop is really not the best way. if you dont clean logout, shutdown, something might go wrong,,, prolly what your experiencing now, and after upgrades and such.
 forevertheuni: no, not mv .gnome do a cp -Rp of .hidden files to a new dir. then you can remove stuff, like .gconf, .gconfd contents, related to the desktop and whats currently there. like i said its tricky.
 forevertheuni: its an art
 forevertheuni: usually you will lose your personal settings of look and feel, but thats ok, as long as you dont remove say, .mozilla or something like that... or .bash...
 forevertheuni: focus on .gconf and .gconfd but back up first... k
 forevertheuni: i also think there might be something wrong with your X server config say, /etc/X/xorg.conf
 opps /X11
 dunno
 forevertheuni: im better at fixing things when im logged into a box, rather then guessing
 ask around more in here, someone knows more about this than i do for sure
 off the top of their head
 forevertheuni: yah thats a fun one lol... i got mine to work no issues
 forevertheuni: something to do with copying a .so file with the right name and path
 forevertheuni: here are some clues for .so issue

 google the searchs with those lines, that link will pop up
