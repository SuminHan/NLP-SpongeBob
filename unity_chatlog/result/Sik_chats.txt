 So, I just updated to 11.04 through the updater, and was forced to go into safe mode since apparently Unity crashes on this hardware (video doesn't respond, sometimes system won't boot at all)... besides I don't like it anyways. Is there any way to set Ubuntu to always start with the old shell?
 jatt: OK, how do I make the old shell the default though? (I'll forget to do it every time, and my mum won't even get she has to do it)
 "Pantalla de acceso" in Spanish?
 Blue1: I can speak English, I just have Ubuntu set to Spanish :P
 Classic Ubuntu, right?
 OK, will reboot, let's see if that does it :O)
 zvacet: OK then I got it
 :P
 OK, it wasn't that (though I wanted to get rid of Unity anyways). Apparently for whatever reason the new Linux kernel doesn't like my computer and won't boot properly no matter what I do, unless I go into safe mode and force it to run with the safe graphics drivers.
 ror: OK, will do that, though later as right now I need to get something off internet >_>
 OK, so I tried both reinstalling the graphics driver and running dpkg off the recovery menu, either way 11.04 still won't boot properly >_< Sometimes it hangs after the login screen, sometimes it outright kicks me into a text mode terminal :/
 I updated to 11.04 using the updater and it won't boot properly now. Sometimes it (or the X Server?) hangs after the login screen, sometimes it outright kicks me into the terminal. I can only boot using safe mode in the recovery kernel :/ Help?
 tomasz: well, I just want Ubuntu to boot properly (and with the real graphics drivers) >_>
 OK, I upgraded to 11.04 and I'm having issues with the video driver it seems... This is the contents of /var/log/Xorg.0.log: http://pzt.me/5rjk I've tried fixing the packages (dpkg) and uninstalling the video driver then reinstalling it, but no matter what I do, X hangs after the log in screen unless I go into safe mode

 Well, managed to get Ubuntu to finally boot properly by installing the nvidia 137 drivers o_o; But why not even the built-in VESA drivers work properly? (trying to boot with those makes the monitor shut down...) I'm curious now
 So for the Nth time in the day I tried to fix the graphics, but no matter what I do I'm completely unable to boot at all in normal mode. I have to go into safe mode for 11.04 to boot. Help?
 I'm using 11.04, and I'm completely unable to boot Ubuntu now unless I go into safe mode. Seems to be an issue with graphics, but messing with the drivers (already tried all the available ones!) doesn't work at all :/
 Hello, does anybody know if there's any known fix for video issues with 11.04? I'm tired of booting in safe mode... Not even the VESA drivers work properly! (and in text mode Ubuntu loads garbage instead of the charset) :|
 edbian: GeForce 7300 GS
 edbian: what's that? (so no :P)
 edbian: checking. Though it depends, sometimes it crashes at the console, sometimes it works fine until after the login screen (then X hangs)
 Um, I should check the acpi stuff too, since in the Xorg logs it also complained about ACPI
 Will try nomodeset first though :P
 Well, nomodeset doesn't work!
 Stupid question, what does vt.handoff=7 in the argument list do? (curious)
 OK... yet I get it with Ctrl+Alt+F1 >.>' Eh, whatever
 stimpie: wouldn't that be Ctrl+Alt+F7 for terminal #7?
 "[    17.370] (WW) Open ACPI failed (/var/run/acpid.socket) (No such file or directory) " <-- What does this mean? It's in my X logs >.>'
