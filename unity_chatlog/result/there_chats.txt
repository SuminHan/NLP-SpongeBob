 hey looks like it's out
 pretty decent dl speed. i thought the server would be hammered
 so
 unity was slow
 anyone else find unity kinda slowish?
 yea
 jaredquinn: noticeably slower
 hmm
 well it's not like really lagging or anything
 it was sort of..hmm.. i kinda have to log back into it and check again
 i installed gnome 3. it's a bit faster
 jaredquinn: that's interesting. not sure what's going on here then :|
 jaredquinn: that's what i was suspecting too
 not yet.
 jaredquinn: i suppose i'll install unity 2d and try it out.
 i kind of like the look and feel of gnome 3 though. although that might just be the novelty of it.
