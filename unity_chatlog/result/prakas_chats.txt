 10.10 takes a lot of time to load
 how many days a ubuntu system booting from a usb pen drive last considering such a drive has a fixed number of write cycles.
 timdot: i am not writing to any directory. just using the machine as a nat gateway
 hmm
 is there a way to clone this usb pen drive incase it fails?so that i can use the other pen drive to boot
 hmmm ty
 will dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb copy the entire file systems in sda to sdb with boot sectors preserved?
 considering sda and sdb are usb removable disks (pen drives)
 top_ramen: just put a regular cd and install to the usb disk
 i use 7.04 fiesty fawn lol
 i still prefer 7.04 lol
 it is more lightweight
 10.10 takes a lot of time to load
