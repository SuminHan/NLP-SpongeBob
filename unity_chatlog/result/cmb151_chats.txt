 hello, I have ubuntu 11.04, and my sound card is not detected. I have a VT1708/A soundcard which is not support by alsa. How can I get my sound working?
 anybody?
 Is there a sound guru in the house? :)
 are there any alternatives to alsa if it does not have a driver for my soundcard?
 Will someone please help me hear ubuntu? My soundcard is not working.
 The sound issue is all over the forums, bu t I have not been able to solve it by using any of the threads there
 Way back in ubuntu 9 my sound worked fine
 VIA VT1708/A it is not supported by alsa
 what other thing can I use?
 80:01.0 Audio device: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT1708/A [Azalia HDAC] (VIA High Definition Audio Controller) (rev 10)
 it used to work back with ubuntu 9
 still works with windows
 rgr: so you are saying no fix then, I must buy another card, or downgrade to 9?
