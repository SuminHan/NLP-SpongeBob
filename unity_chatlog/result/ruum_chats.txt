 hey guys are any of you having trouble with the new distro?
 with basic stuff....
 like getting the main menus back....
 and well how do you unmaximize a window - make go back to resizable
 and in firefox, the main menu seems to be hidden forever - unless I use alt
 sorta
 well who is lol
 ye[
 I think I will.... cuz I suddenly cant make windows re-sizable again, and firefox's main menu are hidden forever unless I use tab
 once maximized, there is no undoing it without closing and reopening the window
 I almost want to go back to v.10.x
 this is a NIGHTMARE
 exit
 ok, I dont know who told me to reboot as ubuntu classic BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
 WHEW.... what a relief!!  I have all my main menus bacn and EVERYTHING
 they REALLY need to get on this new UI version and allow users to have their main menus somewhere....
 not being able to resize and manage your windows is HORRIBLE!!!  But you guys are AWESOME, I would DIE if  I could have my ubuntu classic...
 *couldnt
 ThisNameisCool.... I am sure there is a centos channel
 you should go to that....
 damn guys someone needs to recreate the CentOS channel!!  But still this is for #ubuntu  I would suggest going to the #linux channel for centos help ThisNameisCool.
 oh SWEET!! he should go there then!!!
