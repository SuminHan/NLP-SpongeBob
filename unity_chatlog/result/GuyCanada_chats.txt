 hey guys, updates to 11.04 and now my function-F8 wont work to put up my hdmi. anyone know how to fix this
 mikinanuq: where do i find that? it worked before the update why would it change
 oh perhaps its the lack of nvidia driver thats killing my hdmi out?
 greet: that sounds liek hardware problems not software
 mikinanuq: thanks
 mikinanuq: hey, changed my keyboard to the layout and still no use. any other advice?
 mikinanuq: it is, i see others are having issues?
 interesting
 mikinanuq: interesting. ill try that, is that just since 11.04?
 mikinanuq: alright thanks ill try that. probably be back in a few
 hey guys im having  problem where i cant get my hdmi output to work since upgrading to 11.04
 is anyone else having an issue outputting hdmi with 11.04? im running a nvidia card and im not sure what to do
 dr_willis: video, sorry.
 dr_willis: i used to be able to simple hit function-F8 to go to hdmi and it doesnt work anymore. ive already chaked that my keyboard is mapped properly
 Dr_Willis: its video out, i used to be able to hit function-F8 to go to hdmi and ive checked that my keyboard is mapped properly
 Dr_Willis: Thanks, another guy said the same thing and i tried booting with the external plugged in but it didnt seem to help. How would i do it with the monitors settings? i think the nvidia settings override my monitor settings if that makes sense?
 Dr_Willis: I have im not exactly sure that im doing though but i cant see my other display
 Dr_Willis: interesting, do you have any suggestion about what could be done?
 Dr_Willis: hey, i have it working now the display is detected but i remember doing this before now. nvidia isnt very good at handling this stuff, when i plug in a new monitor is affects my computer monitor ins strange ways and i cant just copy my computer display to the other monitor. i think im going about it wrong now that i think about it tho. i dont want a second monitor i want to output as if i were using the pc for a presentation or simmilar
 Dr_Willis: for my computer i can normally press function-F8 so do this but now its changed, im not sure if that means anyhting to you
 Dr_Willis: again im not really sure what that means, nvidia can detect the display right now if i go to configure it as a second monitor but not to hit fn-F8 so im not sure what that means. is there a way to manually turn on video outputs?
 Dr_Willis: woah i got a strange message this time when i hit fn-F8 it says "could not switch monitor configurations for crt 351"
 Dr_Willis: ok, also its kind of interesting if i go to the monitors preferences it does NOT detect another monitor
 --help output
 Dr_Willis: hey i just installed GRandR and it also doesnt detect the monitor so that appears to be the problem.
 doesnt anyone know how to manually turn on a hdmi output port? its not being detected by my monitors preferences or GRandR
 does anyone*
 how do i restart x server?
 is there any reason that nvidia would see an attached monitor but system>monitors would not? im trying to hit function-F8 to display my screen on a tv. i dont want to set up miltiple monitors through nvidia i just want to be able to HDMI out when watching tv through my computer can anyone helo?
 help?*
 so, totally off topic but is anyone watching the fights? i cant get them, did GSP just lose?@!?#
 iam126: oh ok thanks you, ive been hearing rumblings
