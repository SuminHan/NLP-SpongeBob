 hi... i need some help.... my lap runs on ubuntu 10.10
 i initially configured my comp in such a way that both my /home and /var load from the same partition as the partition in which / is mounted
 i have now moved all the files of /home to a separate partition and configured my fstab to mount /home from the new partition
 i've moved all files to the new partition but there's a .gvfs file or folder in my home dir which i am not able to move, even as root
 it says that even the root doesn't have permission to move the file
 will there be any problem if i don't copy the .gvfs file?
 how do i fix it?
 can someone help me please
 terry,  cd /home; mount /dev/sda7 /home/seek2; mv seek/* seek2/
 terry, .gvfs is gnome filesystem
 bp0, what is fuse mount?
 terry, yeah... i'm planning to use /dev/sda7 for /home only
 bp0, oh cool thanks.. i'll try doing that... logging in as root in tty1 will also do right?
 terry: i mv-ed the /home folder and it worked... except for this single file
 terry: why the archiving -a??
 terry, thats .gvfs.... i googled it to find that is a gnome virtual file system
 terry, ls -la .gvfs displays the following: ?------- ? ? ..gvfs
 even as root i don't have permissions to edit the file
 jbache: is it a directory?? i have no idea cuz it doesn't say anything specific in ls -la
 terry: as i said you earlier, the root doesn't have permission to edit it
 terry: i have no idea.... since it is a gnome vfs, i don't want my lap to crash because of it after removing the original dir
 terry: i can't try it at the moment, i'll have to login in the recovery mode as bp0 said... i'll try it out and get back
