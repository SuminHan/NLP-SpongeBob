 Is anyone else having trouble with enabling unity?
 hypetech: It should, but I had to install proprietary drivers, so it booted into default gnome, and now it won't switch to unity. when I run 'unity' in the terminal, the computer freezes
 OverTheHillAndFa: Alright, thanks for the advice!
 Okay, I reinstalled, a different graphics driver, checked 'ubuntu' at log in, and I'm still not getting unity. None of the compiz effects are working either. Is there any simple way to activate unity?
 Hey guys, Is there any way to test to see If my current graphics driver supports unity
