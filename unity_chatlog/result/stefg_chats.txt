 OvidiuZeicu: gksudo nautilus will give you a file-manager with superuser privileges. Where do you want to save your files to?
 mtlife: not by the nvidia driver, only by nv or noveau (the open source ones)
 OvidiuZeicu: sudo rsync -av /media/damaged_drive/ /media/good_drive
 mtlife: i don't know. to use unity you'll need the nouveau driver (which is somewhat 3d capable). nv is fine for the classic desktop. But given that a entry level nvidia card is about 20$/Euros you should consider replacing your card if you really want unity

 step21: get an alternate CD via torrent and use that as an upgrade source..... or even better: wait 6 weeks until the bugs are ironed out :-)
 step21. if you did your last update 2 days ago you should be on release level. Except unimportant timezone updates there wasn't much happening yesterday and today

 Killyou: feel free to contribute and run your own mirror :-)
 phoenixsampras: restore the backup you made before upgrading
 ssav: login as your user, get root by 'sudo su -'
 ssav: so you lost all your login data, but want to remote-enable root access ? .... I think there would be much interest in a way to that ...
 escott: there's a difference : sudo su - gets you root, with all consequences, sudo -s just gives you a root shell .... try 'gzip </dev/some_device >image.gz' ... won't work with sudo -i , but works after getting root with sudo su -
 llutz: does it? on debian it won't
 cordoval_: why can't you just start over?
 cordoval_: Ahh.... bad timing for a power outage... dpkg --configure -a
 cordoval_: i think you should save your files from the hosed upgrade and do a fresh install...

 jiltdil: I#d wait 6 weeks and do a net-intsall
 laumonier: how much ram?
 jiltdil: ubuntu has never been good at getting releases ready ..... they release at the given date, not when it's /really/ fit for a relaese
 laumonier: stick with 32 bit. your rm is precious, and adobe flash is tricky in 64 bit
 laumonier: 64bit only makes sense on servers and with >4G ram
 jiltdil: that's my belly speaking, i have no particular reason to advise that. Regarding the 32 vs. 64 bit question: if you do lots of number crunching (video encoding) 64 bits might pay off, but for a standard desktop system 32-bit with pae will be more convinient
 loseweighttttttt: servers overloaded
 damiano__: check for zombie processes... killall lighthttps, then 'service start lighthttpd'

 pumeust: because you won't notice the nano-second the process is doing its work, and then put again to sleep by the scheduler :-)
 Fixo: unity requires working 3d acceleration

 mmiller235: you need virtualbox 4.0.6 and the 4.0.6 guest-tools installed. Nattys xserver is pickky...
 mmiller235: hmmm ... works for me
 mmiller235:Vbox's 3d acceleration might have trouble with your hosts graphics driver. what videocard/driver do you use?
 mmiller235: so running classic/ 2d still gives you crashes?
 mmiller235: let me try what happens i i disable 3d for the natty guest...
 mmiller235: just tested natty  in 2d... switched through some themes and resized the desktop... no crashes.
 mmiller235: greetings from captain obvious :-) the art is finding out what it is :-\
 mmiller235: i run 10.04/nvidia as host and an updated natty beta one isntall as guest.
 mmiller235: i'd go to the VBox Forums. i could imagine that an OSX host has a completl different set of problems than a linux or windows host
 mmiller235: have you tried to locate and download a prebuilt guest?

 Samsagax: get 'wrong architecture'? use "the force"!
 TerryBook: you don't :-) options are considered to be too confusing
 TerryBook: there is ccsm which is a somwhat hackish way to do some configuartion... but the general idea is: take ir or leave it (and facing the possibilty that more users don't take, but leave)
 bashelina: even 10G will be enough
 chotaz: if you plan on suspending your machine you need at least your ram size (plus some) . for the average modern machine (which rarely swaps) 1 G is usually enough
 mordof: ou can probably fix it from the lice CD if you are able to chroot into the installed system
 mordof: can you mount the installed system on the Live CD environment?
 mordof: so where have you mounted it?
 alien-007: what type of file system is that?
 alien-007: so it's likely a hfs+ partition...
 alien-007:sudo mkdir /media/foo; sudo mount -t hfsplus /dev/foo /media/foo
 mordof: if you can mount the file system you can chroot to it. this makes it possible to reinstall grub from within the chroot'ed system
 mordof: you should read dmesg
 mordof: often there's hints in this why you can't access a filesystem
 mordof: is your installed system mounted now?
 mordof: so where is it mounted ( ls /media )
 mordof: get a terminal and type 'ls /media'. i think the real mountpoint is some lenghty number dir in /media
 mordof: so cd to that dir
 mordof: when you are at the root of the installed system you need to bind-mount /proc /sys and /dev, and then chroot into it
 mordof: if you did not -bind-mount /dev it's useless
 mmiller235: in case you are still interested... i've build and exported a natty appliance which works on my box... you can d/l that at http://ubuntuone.com/p/pEp/
 Actually that might be useful for anyone running virtualbox: Premade natty appliance (with 3D and unity)  at http://ubuntuone.com/p/pEp/
 ChessTeach: you can (and should) use software raid (mdadm). the real question is: why would you want it?
 ChessTeach: no gains to be expected. Transfer rate is nothing versus access time. This won't help. all you get is a statistically doubled risk of data loss
 ChessTeach: rather look into lvm... you can still stripe volumes over physicl disks, but the real adavntage is manageability
 ChessTeach: bios raid or (proper) mdadm raid is actually the same, only the means are different (the CPU is doing the processing anyway). Bios raid is for dumb OS's which don't have software raid, you don't need that in linux. But either way: raid0 on desktop systems isn't worth it. you pay a price for nothing. you might get a bit more transfer rate, but the real limiting factor is access...
 ...time. consider a SSD if you are a speed junky
 ChessTeach: rather do a clever partition layout and use lvm. having /var and / on different spindles helps a lot
 Barsuk: i'm tempted to give you the !best factoid, but in this particular case handbrake wins hands down

 truepurple: i did not read thru the whole bug report... i just wanted to make you aware of google-fu. 'ubuntu natty fglrx build failure' spit these links out. Since you were able to track down the issue, you should be able to find out what applies to you and what not :-)
 truepurple: it is obviously *not* above your head. you managed to pastebin the exact right log... http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/amd-ati-catalyst-114-released-just-in.html might shed some more light on that
 truepurple: unfortunately i don't know the package names for the ATI stuff. sudo apt-get autoremove fglrx-installer might be worth a try
 truepurple: and check in /etc/X11 ... if there is a xorg.conf then rename or delete it.. After a reboot you should have the situation before you installed the proprietary driver, then you can start over and install the open source one
 truepurple: google-fu, 2nd part: "ubuntu natty fglrx uninstall" turns up https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver

 Laibsch: My first cheap attempt would be  "sudo dpkg-reconfigure lvm && sudo update-initramfs -u -k all" in the hope that lvm becomes aware again of the encrypted volume and writes that to initramfs
 Robert__: and you have set the machine to boot from , say, CD first and have mounted an ISO image to the virtual CD-drive?
 Robert__: you'll need to add a controller... but i think you shoud re-read the vbox docs. it's getting offtopic for the ubunut support channel
 Robert__: http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#settings-storage will explain the details. offtopicmeans that this is the ubuntu support chat, and your virtualbox question isn't really ubuntu-related
 Robert__: the link i gave you points to the online manual of virtualbox... and then there is the dedictaed channel #vbox
 pfifo: to get that 60's feeling?  .... i'd rather ssh into that box
 Susanna: using unity?
 Susanna: I'd resort to 'classic'. Seems that the (oh so resource-friendly, 3D-needing) new desktop overstresses  the capabilities of you hardware
 _Neytiri_: the Desktop installer does not support raid-installs. you either need the alternate CD or make a single disk install and migrate that to a raid array later.
 _Neytiri_: what do you want to do specificaly?
 phunyguy: have a look at your indicator applet ...
 olabandola: first wind out what make and model it is. lspci / lsusb will tell you that
 .mastro: either get an ubuntu preloaded one from companies like system76 or (in case you live in a country they don't deliver to) consider a thinkpad R/L/T-series... it's the de facto standard
 olabandola: wait a sec...
 olabandola: i guess the avagotech device is it
 mastro: right
 olabandola: but it could as well be the wlan. Tell about the hardware: what make/model, is the WAN-Adapter internal or is it a stick?
 olabandola: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Netbooks#Compaq%20Mini%20700EL makes me optimistic... does normal wlan work out-of-the box?
 olabandola: give me dmesg to pastebin and read http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1008200
 olabandola: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1008200 has all the info. Sorry, no pm
 mastro: i don't know. i just wanted to let you know that a lot of developers run thinkads, there is huge community support for them so its the most hassle free notebook to run linux on.  Lenovo is quitting the R-series, maybe you can find one on sale
 gac: that explains it. grub and the bios seem to disagrre wht the boot drive is
 gac: didn't you just say you added a sata drive for the install?
 gac: i see... so the ubuntu installer/grub never saw mor than one disk?
 gac: are you on Live CD now?
 gac: what you could try is booting the Live CD, chroot into the installed system and reconfigure/reinstall grub
 gac: Right, but you try to figure out what the problem is first... look at /etc/grub/default and /boot/grub/grub.cfg .... analys waht grub takes as environment and so on.
 gac: is there some kind of "virus protection" enabled in the bios which prevents write access to the boot sector?
 gac: i'd first try reinstalling (and verifying) grub to the disks mbr
 Ultimate_Chaos: Create a new user for testing purposes and try if the problem is the same with a fresh account

 OwenLA7QZ: right click on a .pdf file and choose options. Select acroread as default
 OwenLA7QZ: chrome/chromium uses nautilus' default

 !pm | OwenLA7QZ:
 OwenLA7QZ: it was guesswork. Meanwhile i checked it myself and did not find that update-alternatives changes the default pdf reader
 OwenLA7QZ: and another thing is: it is not ubuntu. hell knows what the developers of your dstro did, so there is no guarantee that things woorking in ubuntu work in a derivative as well

 Primedeath: CPU-wise you should be fine, deppends on how much ram you have. Official PPC support was dropped after 6.06, so i don't know how good the community port of later releases is

 Primedeath: yeah, sounds reasonable. If you have around a gig of ram ii'd try a 10.04 install, and hunt down some ppa-repos for things like firefox and stuff

 sss314: depends how much time you have... if you have a working upgraded box: perfect.... if you fear first spending time an bandwidth on an upgrade, but reinstall anyway after everything broke, then reinstall. and make sure to cover your line of retreat.... 11.04 has its rough edges, so make sure you can revert
