 is it ok to create a user with name "user" ?
 kellnola: why not?
 zvacet: velcroshooz:  I thought there is a reserved name or something
 zvacet: velcroshooz: kellnola: ok, thanks.
 Soothsayer: for most use cases it takes less memory
 Soothsayer: if you have more than 4GB of ram, maybe you need the 64bit (on windows you do)

 how can I find out who is using file descriptors on my server?
 I've reached 1024 which seem to be the limit
 "cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr" gives me "1024 0 38001" The file descriptors are used mainly by root and www-data so why do I hit the 1024 limit?
 how do I check the global max allowed file descriptors?
 mbroeker: isn't it per user?
 mbroeker: in /etc/security/limits.conf I have "root hard nofile 30000" and "root hard nofile 30000"
 mbroeker: "sudo cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr" gives me "1024 0 38001" and it doesn't go over 1024
 mbroeker: I thought that 1024 in "ulimit -a" is per user and in my case several users use the FD so I shouldn't hit the limit
 mbroeker:  not sure. thanks :)
