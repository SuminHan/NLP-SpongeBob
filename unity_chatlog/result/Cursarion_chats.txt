 :o
 is it possible to mark a HD partition bootable, put contents of Ubuntu ISO file there and install from it on boot?
 instead of DVD/USB stick
 Incarus6: no access to an USB tick
 but how do you mean persistent?
 PresuntoRJ: well, the contents of the ISO file
 PresuntoRJ: 'cause there's no access to an USB dongle
 so basically there's the HD to install on and the ISO image, which can be extracted on the HD
 but no USB stick or CD/DVD
 can it be done with the HD alone?
 PresuntoRJ: the point is there are no physical USB drives available
 pfifo, Dr_Willis: grub is installed
 Curly_Q: install the OS without a CD/DVD/USB stick
 Curly_Q: I have two HDs. One of which has linux installed but when i bought a new pc i couldnt load up linux. Im going to use the old ext3 partition to extract the iso content and boot from it and install a new linux instalation on the other hard drive
 hm, yeah, I didn't mention there's two of them
 thanks Dr_Willis, Curly_Q & others
 dunno if xchat does msn
 what command are you using?
 glycan: haha
 how did you use it without partitions?
