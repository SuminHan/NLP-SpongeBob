 I have just installed xmame and gmameui and upon starting it is asking where the mame executables are.  I have no idea where to find them!
 [thor], My problem is I have no idea what the 'mame executable' will be named. What extension?
 [thor], ok, it only brought up an icon file and a file called gmameui.desktop.  Somehow I don't think these are executables
 Ok, another tact....is there an irc channel for gmameui?
 bazhang, thanks, searched and none found.
 Ok, one last try.  Does anyone know how to setup gmameui in Ubuntu?
 what is the irc channel for ubuntu just general discussion?
 I found it, thanks
