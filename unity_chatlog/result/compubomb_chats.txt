 is it worth me upgrading to 11.04?.. my system right now on 10.10 is pretty stable, no issues what so ever.
 I'm just wondering what the major benefits are.

 MrHatter: i have a default install on my pc, so no other partitions other than linux
 LjL: yah, that is what i was thinking, other than it would be nice to get open office 3.0
 anyways..
