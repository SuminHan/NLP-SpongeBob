 stereocaulon_, did you mean you had problems with just upgrading to 11.04 or with WoW?

 Has anyone here gotten WoW to work on 11.04?
 for 11.04? where?
 ActionPartnership, i looked there but didn't see anything on ubuntu 11.04 issues
 ActionPartnership: i've tried everything in the guide, and have been asking in winehq but i'm not sure the problem is wine related
 Dave888, did WoW start right up after upgrade or did you change something?
 if anyone has gotten WoW to work on 11.04, please let me know what you did
 ohsix: i've tried both and it seems to be an opengl issue rather than wine
 so getlibs comes up as bad quality, anyone used it?
 okay i've got 64 bit nvidia driver, and ia32 shared libraries. what other 32 bit libraries are there that i would need for 32 bit WoW?
 where can i get updated 32 bit libraries for 64 bit ubuntu?
 where can i download 32-bit development libraries for 64 bit?
 apparently i need to 'install 32-bit development libraries', where might i find them?
 32-bit dev libraries, anybody know where to get them?
 trihope: Ctrl+N on the open window
 ChogyDan: doesn't do it
 trihope: are you using chrome or firefox?
 yes, that's not quite what you were asking
