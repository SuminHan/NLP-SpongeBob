 anyone try updating to Natty Narwhal
 i did and my video now has to run in low graphic mode
 so far i'm not to impress with ubuntu, first update and it blows up!!
 and it's garbage huh
 when i boot up i see my desktop with flashing icons, mail and untitled folder
 then i reboot selecting run in fail safe,
 sorry about that
 any idea how to add my nvidia video card
 don't load natty
 where do i run nvidia-xconfig from
 any idea why video works in fail safe mode but not in regular
 yes it is
