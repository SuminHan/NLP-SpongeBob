 Anyone know how to remove launchers from the panel in Gnome3 fallback mode?
 red2kic: I know the nuclear option of how to get rid of them.
 red2kic: remove your user dconf file
 red2kic: ~/.config/dconf/user
 red2kic: They must have been smoking something the day they made dconf binary format.
 red2kic: I have considered switching environments.
 red2kic: They did the same shit, though not this bad, with Gnome2.
 red2kic: :P
 red2kic: Sadly it takes them years to get it right. When they do, they are bored, so they start over. :\
 red2kic: Not invented here syndrome.
 red2kic: I think that was nautilus, which can be brought back
 red2kic: you need gnome-tweak-tool, and then set file manager | have file manager handle the desktop | on
 red2kic: then run nautilus. I just tried it, it let me change my background.
 red2kic: gconf-editor = dconf-editor now
