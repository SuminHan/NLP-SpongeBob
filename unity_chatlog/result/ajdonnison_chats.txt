 buhman, the default sudoers file sets those that are in the admin group as being able to use sudo, you can edit /etc/group and drop your user out of that group if that is the problem.
 buhman, yes, you need to re-login.
 The /etc/group file is only read at login.
 buhman, it doesn't.
 buhman, su should ask for the root password, sudo asks for the user password, which are you using?
 buhman, yes is not a valid answer to my question.
 buhman, so do you still have a problem? Or need clarification?
 buhman, I think you are confusing su and sudo.  They do different things.  sudo only ever asks for the user password (unless configured not to), su only ever asks for the target user's password.
 LAcan, you need them in an 'auto' stanza.
 LAcan, better to use the resource grobe pointed you to.
 LAcan, did you do a 'man interfaces'?
