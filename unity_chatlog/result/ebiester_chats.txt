 Howdy all. My xorg.conf is broken without backup. I want to regenerate, but the only thing I saw while googling was uninstalling xorg and reinstalling/dpkg-reconfigure. Is there a less drastic option?
 ohsix: I'm currently running without any xorg.conf. :)
 ohsix: I have a new laptop that has two separate video cards, so I can't tell if it's running on the intel or the nvidia chipset right now. However, when I upgraded to 11.04, I got a popup that said my video card wasn't powerful enough to run unity.
 Which... seems a bit silly with a 2 month old laptop
 ActionParsnip. I assumed I needed one because I've always had one since '97 and when there was an xconfigurator. I'm not wedded to having one, but right now, flash is having trouble and unity won't run, so I assumed there was a problem.
 ohsix: Sometimes I think a decade+ of unix experience gets in my way with ubuntu. :) -- what would be the best route for debugging this?
 ohsix: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601467/
 ohsix: The nvidia is Nvidia GeForce GT 540M -- I had to look it up. But the series of events is. 1. Install 10.10. 2. try to install the proprietary extension, which kills X. 3. After trying to get the open source nv or intel working, delete xorg.conf. 4. Upgrade to Natty
 ohsix: I installed it from the popup in ubuntu. (Sorry, that was a few weeks ago, I don't have the exact other than remember it suggesting proprietary drivers.) I got rid of all of that, but natty seems to have brought some of it back. Do I just purge all of this? http://paste.ubuntu.com/601469/
 ohsix: If you said something, could you repeat it? I just accidentally cleared the window.
 ohsix: no worries. Thanks. :)
