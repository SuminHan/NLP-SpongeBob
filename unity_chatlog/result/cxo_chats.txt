 update-alternatives --config gcc, says error, no alternatives?
 I need gcc-4.3 on 11.04
 (already installed, just need to get the alternatives switched)
 LjL, it says there is only one alternative link group for cc
 But i installed it with apt-get?
 "gcc-4.3 is already the newest version."
 Nope. Clean install from the desktop iso
 LjL, http://pastebin.com/a0mv1Ujy
 LjL, downloaded release ISO from website, gcc-4.3 command works
 I'm going to downgrade to 10.04. Dont want to mess with it
 LjL, Looks I did go from Beta1 to release. My mistake
