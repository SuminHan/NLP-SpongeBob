 i have a win 7 pc with internet but want to install it on my old win xp along with xp
 ok ill try that
 my iso cd has wubi on it do i need internet for that or can i just use that
 do  need internet to install wubi from my ubuntu cd i made from the iso
 it has wubi on it
 because i dont feel like having to start my live cd in persistent mode every time
 my ubuntu cd has a wubi installer on it. do i need internet to use it
 i can switch workspaces fine
 well you may have had a problem installing ubuntu or its a bug. I am using the live cd
 can i install ubuntu using the wubi on my cd i made from the iso file off the site.
 idk i am new to ubuntu 11.04 i have only used 10.10

 hmm let me think xsinick
 for the live cd try just burning the ubutnu iso to a cd. thats the way i made my live cd im running right now
 Can I install Ubuntu from the Wubi on my Ubuntu installation cd without using internet.
 i know doent it feel like that. I want gnome back instead of unity.
 can i do that from the livecd cause` thats what i use. I dont have natty installed anywhere
 hmm try reinstalling ubuntu kaie. u may have 2 start using 11.04
 um make an installation cd and repartition from the installer
 youll lose everything though
 probably not.
 U may have gotten one of the RARE linux viruses
 I need this ? answered now. can i install wubi from the wubi on my ubuntu 11.04 installation cd without an internet connection.

 i dont want to lose windows
 I want to do wubi so i can get rid of it easy
 ive used wubi before so i want to use it again
 ive done it before no problem
 I use an uninstaller program to uninstall
 what windows did you use
 well i had one problem
 i didnt have enough space on my HD
 but that was it
 nothing other
 so i guess ill just try
