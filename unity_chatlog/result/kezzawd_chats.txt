 Hi all - I'm on Natty and some appindicators are installed but I can't find how to load them - indicator-cpufreq for instance - any ideas ??
 u could try sudo apt-get purge gnome 3 && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop ?
 anyone any idea how to enable indicator-cpufreq appindicator in Natty ?
 PresuntoRJ - yeah - that's what I thought but not working for me ?
 Just stalling in the shell
 hang on - lookls like a bug - appindicator is there but icon is not - it's squeezed between two other indicators without the icon
 PresuntoRJ - what's simplest way for me to see what version ?
 jdobrien - if compiz is working (have you installed ccsm ?) then you are on 3D - I have similar setup and nvidia driver not in use for me also
 dregin1 - Use 'Super' and 'A' to bring up the Applications panel and then use the small drop down in the top right to get to System
 PresuntoJR - I'm using same version as you
 PresuntoRJ Yeah - but I'm kinda getting more used to using the 'Super' key and combinations - which feels better and is relatively rodent neutral
 PresuntoRJ lol - I'm pretty comfortable with Unity myself, although I'd like to see what a more mature Gnome3 has to offer as an alternative. I guess we're going to be moving away from the 'classic' Gnome2 desktop overtime in any case
 Cruncbang is debian based and uses fluxbox - it's a good one
 alokar - try this - http://bit.ly/knlNcZ
 tbf - do you have Ubuntu Tweak installed
 tbf - if you have Ubuntu Tweak then make sure you have show desktop icons checked
 that will stop right-click on desktop if not checked
 tbf you can re-arrange all launchers by dragging them off and then replacing them where you want
 KNUBBIG my pleasure
 tbf - try right-click to remove launcher, then open the application and pin the launcher again ?
 tbf - try this thread - half way down - http://bit.ly/msZLwR
 M13up Hit super key then check out the dropdown menu you see to the right
 M13up - take that back sorry - if you get the application 'lens' up then you should see a dropdown menu to the right
 M13up: the closest I've come to it is the method I described - although I prefer to just hit 'Super' and then type the name of the application / tool I want followed by return
 tbf - if you right click desktop and use 'Create Launcher' it's simpler - then you just need to move the launcher created into .local/share/ applications, and then drag it out of that location into the dock - it works
 tbf: for dock read launcher lol (OSX !!!)
 MoL0ToV: if you install ccsm and not simple-ccsm you also get some options for tweaking unity
 tbf: np
 d4gg3r - try http://bit.ly/mRxybs
 d4gg3r: here you go http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5987637&postcount=11 - the problem you are having is related to Flash
 usr13: try /etc/init as the alternative
 usr13: I have /etc/init/tty*.conf
 usr13: only .conf files
 usr13: 11.04 - the tty*.conf files all point to /sbin/getty tty*
 norbert: try 'Super' and 'W'
 greenit: you could try http://bit.ly/mnjCoK
 norbert_: not sure there is such a thing
 norbert_: as far as I'm aware the panel in unity doesn't have a window menu app -  which I think is what you're after
 norbert_: in Unity default keyboard  shortcut for a terminal window is Ctrl Alt and T
 norbert_: you can still create desktop launchers from a right-click which will give you what you arte after
 Axlin: I agree
 ar71k: How do you open multiple instances of an application with one click ?
 ar71k: not happening for me - just getting default screen-edge behaviour for Unity
 ar71k: OK - talking Unity here
 ar71k: Yeah well norbert_ was certainly talking about Unity when he was referring to opening more than one instance of an app - jeez
 usalabs: you are assuming that there will always be a 'gnome classic'
 Mrokii: if you apt-cache search indicator you'll see a number of packages that yopu can install to give you indicators - there are also a number of ppa's for third party indicators at http://bit.ly/mTLbRa
 Mrokii: just search for it as an application and execute
 Mrokii: np - like you say, not too intuitive
 tasslehoff: which mbp model do you have ?
 tasslehoff: OK - thanks - I have a 7.1 but can't get Ubuntu to install on it
