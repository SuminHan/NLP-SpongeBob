 Hi, does anyone know if texlive is part of the default install in natty?
 Withong_ a bit more sober than banshee but mopidy works natively
 it's based on mpd (music player deamon)
 is it possible to get rid of the 'apps available for download' items in the unity apps menu?
 check some close by mirrors
 I grabbed an iso this afternoon and just upgraded my system tonight, both downloads were really fast
 I wonder what the thought was about putting a tablet/netbook gui in a desktop os
 is there any configuration possible besides the stuff in the ccsm unity plugin?
 like the size of the dash
 akashm1990 I have it installed
 haven't played more than a little bit
 sure
