 jerriy: Sorry, my bad, just run: sudo cat /etc/hostname (">" do not take sudo)
 jerriy: What about: sudo cat /etc/hostname (are you asked for password?)
 jerriy: And you know your password?
 jerriy: sudo should accept password from "username" user
 jerriy: Ok, one sec
 jerriy: First type your password in terminal prompt to see if it is correct, otherwise you can try to make new admin from recovery to fix last one, check if password is ok, first.
 jerriy: Yes to see it in terminal, also try: gksudo gedit
 jerriy: Are you in virtual terminal?
 jerriy: I mean do you have Gui, you know desktop, etc?
 jerriy: And if you type your password in terminal you have right one ?
 jerriy: Once more, in gnome-terminal: type your password to see it letter by leter, to know if it is problem with encodind. Second in tty5 (where you just logged in, test: sudo cat /etc/hostname and check if sudo takes your password).
