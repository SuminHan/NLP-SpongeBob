 is there a way to upgrade without update-manager? dist-upgrade doesn't show any new packages
 z0mbyk1d, well, update-manager's crashing/hanging when I click upgrade, so I'm looking for another way to do that
 I'll ask again, is there a way to upgrade without update-manager?
 kwtm, just upgraded my PC (it has a 120GB /home and a 30GB / sans /home), it was pretty seamless
 besides the downloads taking about 5 hours /me blames IL Ubuntu servers
 Axlin, torrents with apt-get dist-upgrade? :P
 kwtm, small interwebz :P
 kwtm, but seriously, I just avoid the GUI update manager and use sed -i 's/maverick/natty/g' /etc/apt/sources.list && apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
 kwtm, well it's easier this way, and since I have more than two PCs to upgrade, I just cp /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb between PCs and run apt-get
 ubuntu_, I think the live cd uses the classic desktop
 probably because unity needs 3D acceleration
 robertzaccour, no, afaik
 ubuntu_, yep, and you'll have the option to change before login
 ubuntu_, every login, same as if you had kde and gnome
 if you have automatic login, you logout and pick what you want
 ubuntu_, most probably yeah
 not sure about KDE apps in Unity though
 ubuntu_, you're welcome :)
 sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
 ZykoticK9, umm, he asked about beta to final
 unityproblem, you don't read do you?
 unityproblem, <MohammadAG> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
 umm, is there a way to pin the unity launcher/bar?
 cause I'm pretty sure I pinned it by mistake, and can't move it away
 Is there a way to reinstall all gnome-applets that I should have in Ubuntu classic? I had to delete them all from config and I only have the app launcher left
