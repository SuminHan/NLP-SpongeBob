 ohsix: what's oneiric?
 ohsix: AH.. didn't know that
 Strav: in the last 6 years I've learned to have a separate /home and simply "install" from cd, usb whatever to the root instead of upgrading..
 superproxy: clean system fresh install?  about 30 minutes or so.. then you do all the upgrades in one shot
 Strav: did you have multiple HD's in the machine?
 Strav: oh well.. you fixed it though.. that's good.
 freeman_: look for 7zip .. I think that does it too.
 checkers: you're not running dual monitors are you?
 Strav: I feel for you..
 rgoytacaz: sure.. but not the ones downloaded from nvidia.. the ones offered via ubuntu are up to date and work
 checkers: that might be part of the problem.. you have to go to settings before loading the VM and let it know you have 2 monitors.. otherwise you have issues
 rgoytacaz: did you reboot?
 checkers: you using the vbox version from the repos or direct from vbox?
 yuskhanzab: ping <server address>
 ivzel: just ask a question.. don't wait
 ivzel: with the alternate cd you should be able to.
 ivzel: no idea.. sorry
 ivzel: your welcom
 pomke: it's done on the login page.. click your user name and look at the bar at the bottom that appears.. that's where you change the wM
 Robert__: just ask a question.. if someone knows the answer they will
 Robert__: 10.04 is an LTS release .. 11.04 isn't .. you can't upgrade directly unless you reinstall.. if you choose to reinstall then I hope you have a separate /home partiton with all your data so it will be safe..
 fruitwerks-web: sudo service smbd restart .. sudo service nmbd restart should do it.
 xsinick: yes.. but not on natty yet..
 lumbert: yes.. I think unetbootin will do that.. it's in the repos
 bullgard4: you got virtual box installed?
 tesdsfsfdfds: kubuntu w/ the kde interface.. you can have them both loaded at the same time and choose on login which you want to use
 tesdsfsfdfds: that's actually what infamous has..
 cfc_{Pawpad}: to play it in a browser?
 cfc_{Pawpad}: not sure what SL is.. quicktime is part of the restricted package (ubuntu-restricted-extras) .. there's also http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/utils/quicktime-x11utils
 [TK]D-Fender: on the login screen click your user name and then look at the bar at the bottom of the screen that appears.. you can switch to the unity interface there.. if that doesn't work you might have to reconfigure your video by using the menu on the rescue kernel on boot.
 AceKing: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
 AceKing: remember you'll be able to switch interfaces on the login screen
 AceKing: yes.. and no.. depends on your work style.. I'm gonna miss the configurable bars
 AceKing: how have you found the sidebar tempormental?
 AceKing: install compiz config settings manager and change the settings so it never disappears.. the only time mine "goes away" is when I have a program full screen
 AceKing: yes but it's a multi step process.. first install kubuntu-desktop on 10.10.. then go through the upgrade process.  if you have them setup with a separate /home directory (hopefully), you can simply reinstall 11.04 overtop which is infinetely faster and more insured of a positive outcome. Keep in mind kde is similar to older gnome but you'll still be giving instructions
 AceKing: also if you havent used it yet.. you might set them up on teamviewer so you can remote in easily and "show" them how to do things.
 AceKing: yea.. logmein uses .net for some stuff.. yick!  teamviewer is like logmein.. great for getting through firewalls etc. it's also free..
 AceKing: and has a great following..
 AceKing: np :)
 AceKing: kdm for kde and gdm for gnome/unity .. choose kdm .. when you switch to unity it should switch to gdm.. kubuntu doesn't use compiz
 AceKing: kubuntu/kde has also had "gestures" built in for some time
 axisys: lvm is part of the alternate install cd.. and not on the desktop live cd
 Spaz_Dynamic: check out /etc/sources.list or sources.lst.. forgot.. that's where your repos are listed.. it should be there but commented out.. just remove the comments
 kpoman: in unity?  they are on by default.. install compiz-config-settings-manager and tweek from there.
 Ok.. so what's the verdict on a system with dual monitors.. is natty ok or more difficult to be productive?
 bitplane: if you go the upgrade route (provided it actually works) do your "bar" setups still remain?
 bitplane: yes.. on natty.. ctrl+alt+4 or 6
 bitplane: yes
 xAndromeda: install compiz-config-settings manager and do it there.. click on the "unity" plugin
 xAndromeda: but be aware that it will only go to 1/2 screen :(
 ZenGuy311: yes
 FoolsRun: yes.. but unity-2d looks like the old gnome
 old gnome ... lol
 xAndromeda: humm.. I could have sworn it was there.. I changed mine last week.. maybe someone here will be able to chime in.
 xAndromeda: that's high rez.. what kind of monitor?
 mrdeb: yes
 mrdeb: been running it for 3 weeks
 Sengoku: alt+tab
 mrdeb: maybe..
 xAndromeda: I'll bet..
 Sengoku: "doesn't work" is pretty vague.. what's not working?
 Sengoku: perhaps you have the wrong keyboard setup
 researcher123: you gotta be kidding... there's so much info out there on the web about the differences.. search
 Just tried KDE compatibility in ccsm.. weird results..
 byomkeshbakshi: did you pre-make any partitions?
 byomkeshbakshi: ubuntu will require a minimum of 2 partitions.. I recommend 3.. one for / (root), one for /swap (self explainitory, and one for /home where all your data lives.. to do that now you'll have to take the 3 partition and delete it and redo it as an extended partition.. then create 3 partitions under it.. you can do that with the installer just choose "manual" when you get to that point.
 byomkeshbakshi: how large is the 3rd partition
 ?
 tss2: what does?
 byomkeshbakshi: ok.. 10gigs for root described as /.... 1-2 gigs for /swap and the rest for /home
 byomkeshbakshi: yes.. but when you use the installer it will get to a point for partitioning.. choose manual.. from there you have to carve up the the empty partition.. first make it "extended".. then create the 3 partitions.. when you create the 1st there will be an option to choose the mount point.. thats where you tell it what kind of partition.. / for root etc..
 byomkeshbakshi: take your time.. and ask questions if you get stuck
 truepurple: right now.. ext3.. I don't think there's a windows driver for ext4
 truepurple: not natively.. there's a driver you have to install.
 truepurple: fat is horrible.. good for usb sticks etc.. but that's about it.. linux won't use ntfs for /home but will read it .. are you creating a shared partition or are you trying to have access to the /home partiton/directory from windows?
 truepurple: and is this for a dual boot or shared drive off a LAN
 truepurple: so just a separate partition outside of what is normall used for either system?
 truepurple: sure.. /msg me
 truepurple: i'm there.. are you?
 how do I query what channels a nick is in?
 Ok.. Where's skype hiding in the repos?  I've enabled partners and the others with no results
 IdleOne: thanks
 IdleOne: hummm.. the command is the one I tried a few minutes ago and now it works.. sudo apt-get install skype.. seems to be working.. with that installed you mean I can also install the plugins for pidgeon etc right?
 Karen_m: on the live cd?
 Karen_m: have you don't all your upgrades yet?
 Karen_m: strage.. works fine for me on an 8200.. on 10.10 did you install the driver dirct from nvidia or from the repos?
