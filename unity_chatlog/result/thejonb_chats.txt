 anybody else having trouble connecting to repos in maverick?
 :velcroshooz  that's what i figured.  tried installing 11.04 last night and hated it, so now i'm setting up 10.10 again.  can't install any software because i can't connect to repos ha
 so someone suggested i change servers.  not sure how to do that.
 i'm having trouble connecting to repos in maverick because of traffic i guess.  can anybody tell me how to change servers?
 stall:  i didn't find it to be slower.  it's just different.  if Unity slows you down, you can always do Unity 2-D or log in under the Ubuntu classic desktop
 stall:  you'll have to install it manually.  i don't know off hand how to do that, but a simple search on ubuntu forums should point you in the right direction

 linuxtech: tell me about it.  i've been trying to install something via ppa for the last hour and i can't connect
 i'm getting a 404 not found when trying to connect to the nautilus elementary ppa.  is it down?
 Pici: figured.  thanks.
 i'm getting a 404 not found error on a few of my maverick repositories.  Are some of the repositories offline because of traffic?
 what concerns me is that the repositories that are returning 404 errors are the main maverick sources and main 1386 packages repos
 ohsix: ok cool.  guess i'll keep trying back periodically
 thanks
