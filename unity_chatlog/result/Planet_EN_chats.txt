 my gnome-network-manager keeps saying ethernet device is not managed? i removed eth0 from the wired interface how do i add it back?
 hello?
 escott: it says: Error for wireless request "Set Mode" (8B06) : SET failed on device eth0 ; Operation not supported.
 escott: wireless is connected
 escott: do I have to disable wireless for that?
