 hiexpo, sebsebseb ty both
 i need a little help setting up conky. I understand how to create a .conkyrc config file. but i downloaded a setup that is in LUA format and it tells me to put it in ~/.conky (but i dont see a .conky file in my home file)
 hiexpo, hte conky setup i downloaded is in lua format, and it wants me to place it in the .conky directory. which is supposed to be in my user folder, but im not seeing it
 hiexpo, ActionParsnip here is the link with the file i downloaded and the instructions http://www.techdrivein.com/2011/02/6-awesome-conky-configs-that-just-works.html
 ActionParsnip, i linked the URL i was going off of, could u take a look and see if u can understand what it wants form me?
 hiexpo, i have enabled hidden folders already
 hiexpo, ActionParsnip qin i figured it out guys, i had to create a folder and paste the lua into it
 there was no previous folder, i had to create the directory. its working now :D
 hiexpo, i was googling "conky configs" with a time filter of hte last year, and i saw that setup that was pretty
 hiexpo, so i wanted
 hiexpo, nice, but thats a bit too complicated for my girlfriend lol
 hiexpo, nice, ill link u what im going with once im done customizing it
 hiexpo, didnt forget about u, i got terminal running a package update, taking a few minutes before i can load up my new conky config
 hiexpo, ok bud, here is the setup i went with http://i55.tinypic.com/4oo5j.png
 escott which? the guages?
 hiexpo, no, using gnome, 10.10
 escott, that is conky, i just installed it and configured it using a setup i found online
 induz in terminal: ps aux
 the bar im using is cairo-dock
 im still trying to figure out how to get composite to work on my LDXE setup, been trying for days
 cant get any help in lubuntu channel
 hiexpo, the screentshot is gnome, i ALSO have another machine running lubuntu, but i cant get composite to work on it
 hiexpo, the screenshot is gnome, 10.10, all i have done is changed background, added the dock, added conky, and removed bottom panel
 that is it lol
 i didnt
 hiexpo, i really wanna try 11.04 but i cant get the beta to boot for me if my life depended on it
 ive used 10.10 more then anything and to be honest, right now im loving it. im pretty new to linux and im having a fairly easy time figuring it out
 hiexpo,  i really wish my othe rmachine was capable of running 10.10
 question is, will it run smoothly on my other machine?
 my other machine has issues running 10.10 but runs lubuntu 10.10 just fine
 hiexpo, what does LTS stand for?
 hiexpo, sebsebseb ty both
 ok so i have been trying for 5 days to get help in #lubuntu with setting up a composite manager
 so my question is, what kind of performance difference will i see between 10.04, 10.10, and 11.04
 i know that 10.10 is a bit laggy @ times on this machine
 lubuntu runs very well, but i am tired of not being able to get any help w/ setting it up
 so i was hoping 10.04 would run smoother on this hardware
 what kinds of things can i do to make 10.10 run better on lesser hardware?
 nutsfornatty, ive used gimp and photoshop, i prefer gimp by alot, ii just dont like a few bugs ive run into that have cost me 8 hrs of work
 ive tried xubuntu, and lubuntu, and had high hopes for lubuntu but lxde seems to be lacking too much that im used to with ubuntu
 Andre_Gondim, im on lubuntu now, i have been sitting in #lubuntu for 5 days asking for help getting a composite manager running (google is no help at all)
 nutsfornatty, the biggest issue i have with gimp, is on really large projects, the 'undo history' gets so long tthat it will freeze and crash in windows
 nutsfornatty, i havent really used it in linux yet
 andrew_46, i cant find a composite manager that works properly for things like an app dock, and conky
 andrew_46, google doesnt show much of anything that i have found, and nothing that i found helpful @ all about what compositte manager i should even be looking for
 andrew_46, specs: http://www.netbooktech.com/asus-eee-pc-701sd/
 histo, i searched the synaptic package manager for cairo-compmgr and didnt find it @ all
 andrew_46, yea, its a 800x480 resolution, ubuntu installer window doesnt even support that. bottom of the screen is cut off
 have a nub question, reading instructions on google telling me to edit "etc/apt/sources.list"
 where is that directory?
 yea, thats what i just asked... but telling me /ext/apt/sources.list means absolutely nothing to me
 im trying to add debian source to my sources to get a LXDE compatible composite manager
 ty ymer for answering something i could understand
 what do i need to do to edit that? i may be wrong but ymer, your instructions appear to just show me the contents of the file
 harvi i type that and get "command not found"
 harvi, i appear to not have gedit, i am apt-get installing it
 harvi, the last hint got it, tyvm, exactly what i needed
 tsimpson, dont feed trolls :D
 ymer im having a bit of an issue w/ the package im after apparently not exsisting
 kinda annoying
 ciaro-compmgr
 i have been trying to get a composite manager for lubuntu for about a week
 im getting an error: W: GPG error: http://download.tuxfamily.org sid Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY CBF6E0B8483170E9
 y does it have to be so bloody hard to get a composite manager on lxde?!?!?!?
 omfg im about to scream... im so close to just giving up on this
 velcroshooz i am not a linux buff, but after installing a dock and conky, which i desperately want to be running on this machine... im told i need something called a 'composite manager' so that there are not large black boxes around the apts
 velcroshooz, i thought that there was something preventing compiz from working in lxde? or can you help me get it going?
 velcroshooz, unfortunately ubuntu wont run on this machine, but lubuntu runs very very smoothly
 velcroshooz, i think i can handle it. gnome runs decently on this machine till i try to do too much at once, i think running compiz from lubuntu will work out fine
