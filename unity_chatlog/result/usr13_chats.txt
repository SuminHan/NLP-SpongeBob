 miiike: Oh, you have login screen now?  Good!  :)
 miiike: Sorry... didn't understand you.
 miiike: Ok.
 miiike: just got rid of an improperly written config file.
 miiike: ... and restarted the Xserver
 miiike: You removed the file   /etc/X11/xorg.conf  file and restarted gdm which is the Desktop window manager.
 miiike: But you are now back to the OpenSource nvidia driver.  (And not using the proprietary one you installed earlier, it is not being used anymore.)
 miiike: You can (now or later) try and repair it, or.. you can just keep using the OpenSource one, (which for all practical purposes, works just fine).
 cc11rocks: Later
 miiike: well there are tools that can do that, but I think you would need to turn off the Xserver to use them.  nvidia-xconfig  is probably the one you would most likely need to use.  BUT, it is probably the utility that failed and created the error ridden /etc/X11/xorg.conf file in the first place.
 miiike: But, that is not to say it wouldn't work  right the next time.  Who knows...

 cc11rocks: Ok.  Open it up.  Take the heat sink off, clean it really good.  Wipe the heat sink contact area and the CPU contact area with alcohol, dry it off. put on new cpu grease, put it back together.
 cc11rocks: Oh, it's a notebook... well.. That's a bit more complicated.

 afroman: Is this empty space at the end of the drive or in the middle or the end?
 afroman: If it is at the beginning and you can calculate exactly how many bytes to write to, I suppose yes you could, but if it's a section in the middle... well... if you don't know I don't either.
 afroman: free space on a partition?  That is a contradiction of terms.
 afroman: Free space refers to an un-partitioned area on a hard drive.
 afroman: The best thing I can tell you is to make an image of  your drive, (on a usb drive would be one option), and then wipe it clean, and then copy the image back on the drive.
 afroman: Let's say you create a gziped image of the drive, you can delete the partitions, write zeros to it a bunch of times, write the image back onto the drive.
 afroman: There's no other way I know of.  But for just one partition, you could make an image of it and then write zeros to just that partition and then restore the image of that one partition.
 afroman: Let's say it is sda3
 afroman: dd if=/dev/sda3 | ssh $user@$host 'gzip - > /pub/image.gz'  #To make a gziped image of the partiton onto another PC on your LAN.  And then:   dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda3  And then:  gzip -d image.gz | dd of=/dev/sda3  (where the image is on some usb drive or copied to another partition)

 ronr Halzen: I would say that software updates can cause problems occasionally, but I wouldn't go so far as to say they cause a lot of problems.  I've done a lot of upgrades with very few problems.

If you are logged into one of these support channels, what you see is problems problems problems.  90% of the people that are upgrading are having no problems, but people are not reporting success stories here, they are reporting problems.
 Halzen: I would agree with that, ... to a  certain extent.  But you must admit, you see a lot of problems people have with installs too.  Just because one does a fresh intall does not mean it is going to be problem free in the end.   (Actually, this is a topic that should be on #ubuntu-offtopic )
 Halzen: Yep, there are good arguments for both sides.  But I think the bottom line is that fresh-install is ok for those that have not added a lot of extra apps. while dist-upgrade is a good path for those that have heavily customized their systems and added a lot of apps. that weren't in the default install.

 MnCC: are you talking about Midnight Commander?
 MnCC: mc - Midnight Commander - a file manager
 MnCC: Ok, sorry, I don't know about Total Commander.
 MnCC: sudo will do the job.
 MnCC: Is there a particular application your thinking of?
 MnCC: Pretty much all the applications you have installed are going to have all the authority and permissions to do what ever it is they need to do.
 MnCC: You will find that there are some fundamental differences between Linux and MS Windows.  I think this is one of them.
 MnCC: What do you mean every filemanager?
 MnCC: What is it that you are unable to do with the filemanager?
 MnCC: I think you may have a misconception or two about how to do things in the Linux environment.  It's not hard but there are some things that require admin priviledges and there is good reason for it.  The cases where you copy something to a directory that you as a user don't have permission to write to are very rare.
 MnCC: Everything you need, want, use  etc.  are going to be found in your /home/ directory.
 MnCC: You don't dump everyting in one single directory, you orginize our files into directories that make sense to you as a user.
 MnCC: You need to experience a lession in file-management.  Linux is very well organized, (when compared to the way file management is handled in a MS Windows invironment).  Once you get the hang of the Linux way of file-management, you'll love it.
 MnCC: LjL is correct.  I very much like having a separate /home/ partition because I have the option to do a fresh install anytime I want and leave all my files right were they are, undisturbed.
 NO92: What is your problem?
 ablaze: are you using network-manager?
 ablaze: Or console mode only?
 ablaze: iwconfig wlan0 scanning
 ablaze: sudo iwconfig wlan0 scanning
 ablaze: what is the essid of your  wireless router?
 ablaze: sudo iwconfig wlan0 ap any
 ablaze: host av.com
 ablaze: what is the output?  (Did it resolv av.com for you?)
 ablaze: iwconfig wlan0 scan
 ablaze: Do you know the essid of your wireless router?
 ablaze: What is it?
 ablaze: iwconfig wlan0 essid SFR_DA9
 ablaze: dhclient wlan0
 ablaze: host av.com  #Let us know if it is resolving.
 ablaze: I remember now.  It's iwlist:   sudo iwlist scanning
 ablaze: You have encryption on the router?
 ablaze: I'm sorry, I've got to go now.  But if you'll turn off the encryption on the router it will be easy.  Just do: iwlist wlan0 scanning ; dhclient wlan0  #That should do it.
