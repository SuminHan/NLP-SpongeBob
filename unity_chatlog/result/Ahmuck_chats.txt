 installed 11:04 in a vm.  did not have 3d turned on.  turned graphics off and gave me gnome 2.x.  is there a way to reset the process to get unity?
 sebsebseb: there's a special setup?
 i can use comipz, but don't have it currently turned on
 hi maco
 long time no chat
 so, u mentioned something about vbox drivers?
 sebsebseb: thanks.  that worked great
 i need help with unity
 how do you modify the top and side bar?
 preferences
 i also need to change the resolution for the monitor, but can't find a resolution changer anywhere
 is there a way to make unity double wide?
 what options are there for the unity button menu?
 it's stacking icons.  is there a way to get two button menus
 why is the unity bar hiding to the side?
 is there a way to customize the top bar?  left click does nothing?
 can i say bad things now?
 for example, the text is dark and no way to read it
 not an applet.  i have 20 icons on unity bar and it's stacking them.  don't need them stacked.  don't want the bar hidden
 yes, left side panel
 left click for menu options don't work, all i get is options for the applet
 Dr_Willis: heh, mine is hidden, i'm trying to get it back
 so, without multiple unity bars, it's a bit borked for me
 opening konversation, i have to go through and drive down the bar to the bottom to get it back without the taskbar
 it's a neat start, but clunky
 unity bar works great for touch screen, not so great for mouse
 how do i get unity off and gnome back on
 Furry, yes
 I'd like to drop back to gnome, how?
 is there a proceedure for removing unity?
 qin: why?
 isn't this the ubuntu channel?
 unity is a good start, but it's built for tablets, not desktops
 and needs to be thought out a little more for the desktop
 is there a way to get ubuntu classic from the install menu?
 does the option stay as a saved value, or must i always go through an extra click to get past unity
 so that i don't sound like an ogre, unity has it's pluses.  it was simple, and the desktop switcher was genius.  previously i had already set my desktop up in gnome in a unity type of configuration.  the disappointment with unity however was the complete loss of configuration options
 thx
