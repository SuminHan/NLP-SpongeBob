 I am having an issue regarding installing ubuntu...
 I downloaded the CD from the website,
 and used it to install.
 once the installation was done
 it asked me to remove the CD so it could re-boot.
 so after I did, and it rebooted, it just sat there.
 after going thru the POST screen
 @gmachine_24: 11.04
 no
 many times,
