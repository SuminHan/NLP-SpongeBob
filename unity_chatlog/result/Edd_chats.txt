 i upgraded from maverick to natty , everything was done gr8, after reboot i couldnt boot in, i got a shell window login
 and i got the same error after a fresh installation for 11.04
 i dont get gui
 oldos2er yes i did
 it says i should install xinist pkg
 intel oldos2er
 oldos2er i will and get back to u if it works
 yea sure i will
 brb
 im having trouble installing natty
 After installation of natty i get into a shell login, no GUI
 any1 can answer ?
 gmachine_24 goes straight to grub
 i choose the kernel
 i login to tty
 startx fails with an error of not installed pkg of xinit
 never had this error since ubuntu 7
 gmachine_24 it gives the loading screen of pkgs
 then it gives an error of no turbo driver or something
 and i login to tty
 i gues tthe boot screen
 containing the running rpocesses
 ok gmachine_24
 ah
 that's the perfect error
 gmachine_24: plymouth command failed
 disconnected from plymouth
 >>> mountall
 any1 hada problem after installing 11.04 ?
 argh
 i cant get my GUI
 this is another error with intel
 ActionParsnip yup :) the tty
 ActionParsnip it will fix the P{lymouth error ?
 let's try
 ActionParsnip: unknow boot option 'nomodeset'
 ActionParsnip lucid fix problem will solve natty's ?
 ActionParsnip i read the site, this is not my error
 my error is : i login to tty no GUI
 erro: mountall: Disconnected from Plymouth
 mountall: Disconnected from Plymouth <<< any idea ?
 ohsix i used ubuntu since v.7
 never had this error
 on the same laptop
 ive never been disappointed with linux till this day
 ActionParsnip i mean ubuntu ! wt' sthis error regarding plymouth
 never had it!
 ActionParsnip how can i get rid of it ?
 ActionParsnip i booted in text mode, i want GUI
 ActionParsnip u mean via: startx ?
 ActionParsnip nothing is loading
 :/
 that's the point
 ActionParsnip me see wait
 ActionParsnip: mountall: Disconnected from Plymouth
 ActionParsnip fsk succeeding nothing more
