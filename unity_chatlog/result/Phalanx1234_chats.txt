 Hey guys
 Can someone help me with an issue,
 Google has failed me....
 Haha ok, =P
 Getting a booting issue,
 tried running fsck and I get this
 ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fsck /dev/sda1
 fsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2
 e2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
 fsck.ext4: Device or resource busy while trying to open /dev/sda1

 No,
 ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo umount /dev/sda1
 umount: /dev/sda1: not mounted
 I am using a live CD
 That's how I'm talking to you =P
 Checked it, it's unmounted
 Anyone know a fix for the boot fail, http://paste.ubuntu.com/601279/.
