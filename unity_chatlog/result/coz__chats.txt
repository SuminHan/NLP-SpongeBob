 ^Phantom^,  open synaptic   hit search  and type  icedtea,,, remove all installed packages  and sun will be default at t hat point
 oh boy ,, is everyone on natty now ?? :)
 Flynsarmy,   you mean in Unity?
 Flynsarmy,  well no unless you log off and then change the session to classic gnome
 Flynsarmy,  I hear you  for sure,,   Unity is best used on small screens  so   use classic gnome
 Flynsarmy,  if classic is removed at some point,, I am guessing it will be an easy install
 actually  there should be 2  releases   Unity   and ubuntu
 at least that is my opinion
 ok let me boot into natty
 elb0w,  if you install gnome3  it will break Unity
 Soothsayer,  yes although I would google      ubuntu dual boot  windows 7   to be sure there are no particular things that have to be done
 elb0w,    that one I am not sure,,, you could remove unity,,, and then install gnome3  ,, however,,, gnome3 uses mutter as the compositor,, I dont think it can   compete with compiz
 brianl,   all you need to do is  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  to get up to speed
 z0mbyk1d,    try sudo apt-get  dist-upgrade
 brianl,  ooo
 brianl,  well right now I cant even get an update / upgrade,,, the servers are bogged down,, so hold on for a bit
 brianl,  ok open synaptic package manager and under the "Edit"  menu   click   "fix broken packages"
 mah454,   this is one link   http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/dvd/current/   but its for the daily build
 ActionParsnip,  I didnt think so   thanks
 Lungan,   not sure  ,, depends on what you want to customize
 Lungan,   the gnome panel... yes?
 Lungan,  well do you want to change its appearance or add applets to it?
 Lungan,   ok,, well to change its appearance you need to go to system/preferences/appearance  and hit the customize button,,, to add applets to it  just right click the panel    "Add to panel"  and choose from a list of available applets
  Lungan  ooo,,, that's not good,, I assume you have already rebooted ,, probably several times... not sure then,, troubleshooting an upgrade as opposed to a clean install,, can sometimes be painful
 Lungan,  oh  wow thats bad,, did you try to  change the session to  classic gnome?   see if there is a performance difference
 trans,  you already rebooted after install the nvidia drivers ....yes?
 Lungan,  ok  well,, if your system cant handle it,,, and from you mentioned it should work fine,, you can in stall  unity-2d  ,,, by the way   which video card is on that system?
 ubuntutryout777,  dont forget to reboot the system after installing that driver :)
 ubuntutryout777,  you are installing the nvidia driver on a live session?
 ubuntutryout777,   let me know if it works
 Gawwad,  no next lts is 12.04   april of 2012
 Gawwad,  no problem ,, if you prefer LTS  then dont bother moving to this release,,
 Gawwad,  yes and you can upgrade to 12.04  when it is release,, a direct upgrade from 10.4  ot 12.04
 to
 Lungan,   as I recal  I dont think so,, there were plans to have it able to move anywhere on the screen but I think that was not included either
 Lungan,   I agree,, but I prefer cairo dock :)
 Lungan,   cairo-dock    it should be in the repository
 jatt,  a new version  named   GTR  will be available at some point.. not through canonical,, it is   ubuntu gnome remix,, with gnome3 as default
 asmogator,  maybe read here?  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DynamicDNS
 :)
 phoque_uni,   out of curiosity,, which video card do you have ?
 narf_,   log off  change session to  classic gnome
 phoque_uni,   ok  ,, I know too little about ati to be any use,,,
 bp0,  you can yes for sure since that is LTS
 vabigoon,    go to youtube.com    search for  ubuntu 11.0   or  ubuntu  Unity
 saml,   no compiz is the compositor for Unity
 vabigoon,  it is just a alternative   DE  environment ,, you can change it to classic gnome via sessions when you log in
 phoque_uni,  they should be ,, but if you want to be sure go to #compiz-dev and ask  smspillaz  the main developer
 DJones,  that channel will be availabe in about a week or 2
 LukasIgnat,   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
 rcconf,  because a gazillion people are using it ?
 euclid,  as long as your drivers are installed ,, yes
 theholder,  are you on 10.10 right now?
 electronicboy_,  unless you use the minimal install cd
 John_Gate,   run  jockeyt-gtk
 [diablo],  oh you mean that scroll bar overlay thingie|
 [diablo],   are you on the unity desktop or classic,,,?? you said classic ...yes?
 [diablo],  are you also running  compiz?
 [diablo],  ok open ccsm,, I believe we have a plugin at the bottom of th e list for that    although I havent tested it ,, sam put one in there  ,, give a try by either disabling it or clicking on it to see available options,, I cant get into it right now
 [diablo],  let me know if you can adjust it from there
 [Soma],   the worspace switcher  should do that
 [diablo],  ah darn,,  let me check ,, hold on
 [diablo],  sorry ,, I am on 10.10 right now and my ccsm   /  libc  is bad in  11.04  so I cant access  ccsm from there
 [diablo],   check in synaptic to see if the compiz-plugins extra are installed
 [diablo],  as i recal from 2 days ago... there was a plugin for it  but  again I will have to reinstall to find out :(
 echo2,  I dont think you will
 POOPHAMMER,  you have no desktop environment?
 POOPHAMMER,   ok,,, do you have a cursor and wallpaper?
 POOPHAMMER, ok in  the text console there  ,, you have already logged in ..yes?
 POOPHAMMER,   ok  in that text console    type   sudo restart gdm
 mello,   well if it was compiz that made this happen  open ccsm  go to Preferences and  hit the "Reset to defaults"  button
 mello,   oh!!
 mello,   are you in classic gnome desktop?
 mello,  maybe you disabled the  ubuntu unity plugin in ccsm ??
 mello,  oh!!!!  gnome shell??
 mello,   gnome shell will break Unity
 Monotoko,   keep opening multiple instances ?
 Monotoko,  I am on natty now with 4 terminals opened... just open a new one and another instance will show up
 Leprikonas, ah I completely forgot about middle click :)
 aguitel,   what is it you dont want specifically?
 aguitel,  not sure how much left  you will have with just core,,, I dont have a good answer for you,, its likely Unity will break if you do this..however,, you could go to gimpnet server and the #gnome  main channel and ask
 phoenixsampras,  i couldnt agree more ,, however  "there it is "  :)
 phoenixsampras,  there has been a slight leaning towards mac like  look ,, buttons on the left and now global menu.. I am not sure what the long term vision for ubuntu is,, I just know did not get it right  but  there are people who think they did so ,, as I said   "there it is "
 ManateeLazyCat,  are you on gnome3  or ubuntu 11.04?
 ManateeLazyCat,  ooo   ok...
 ManateeLazyCat,  not that I am aware of  no...
  hey guys,, just out of complete confusion , what is  this?  http://susegallery.com/a/vkjufU/ubuntu-1111-beta-2
 understand I just woke up lol
 Dr_Willis,   phew I thought I moved into the future :)
 Incarus6,  how is it disappointing for you?
 Incarus6,   so you tried calssic gnome or Unity with the side launcher?
 Incarus6,  mm which video card do you have there?
 Incarus6,  move your curso to the upper left corner of the screen,, see if the launcher pops up for you
 Incarus6,  thats sort of odd but not completely,, i have seen Unity not start up correctly  for me and many others,,  not sure what the issue is but apparenlty you are a kde  lover so I suppose its not too important :)
 Incarus6,  this is true , however I have dual monitors here,, a while back  unity was useless on dual monitor set ups,, its still sort of that way but now uses that darn global menu on both monitors
 Incarus6,   cute
 nmvictor,   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
 nmvictor,  rather  do you want to change ubuntu versions ?
 nmvictor,   then that command is not it,, I forget the proper command for and actual version upgrade
 nmvictor,  not for version upgrade
 !upgrade
 !upgrade | nmvictor
 !upgrde | nmvictor
 mmm
 nmvictor,    For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
 rcconf,  there is a firefox plugin named   video  downloadhelpr
 sorry  that is old
 apologies guys
 maximm,  ah,, compiz is the window manager
 maximm,  open ccsm and make sure the Move window plugin under  window management category is en abled
 NyvenZA,  cook
 cool
 NyvenZA,  rather  I meant cool
 ardchoille,  not that I am aware of ,, you mean a theme from system/preferences/appearance ...yes?
 ardchoille,  it may something in your themes  that is causing the issue,, not sure though
 ardchoille,  did you compress your themes and try instaling from that tar.gz,,, yes?
 ardchoille,  oo something is definitly up then,, did you already install your themes ..yes?
 ardchoille,  and was this happening "before" you attempted to install your themes?
 ardchoille,  ah then I am puzzled,,  it could be the install is not complete?   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
 ardchoille,  mmm then I am puzzled,, you say you installed 11.04  via net install?
 sexygurl2furl,  i didnt see your post,, would you mind posting again??  if I can i will help
 ardchoille,  oh so ONLY nautilus is not respecting them,,,,yes?
 ardchoille,  ok  I may have to log into Unity to test this one,, if it is the same for me then it is most likely a bug,, hold on a few minutes
 ardchoille,  well hold on until I return
 ardchoille,   ok I am on unity ...let me test the themes ,, hold on
 ardchoille,  looks like nautilus is respecting the themes here :(
 ardchoille,  this has to be something on  your end
 ardchoille,  no problem.. if you can ,, download the minmal install cd
 ardchoille,  ok cool...although the minimal install cd I think is about 12 megs
 ardchoille,  not likely a download error and especially if you burn at 1x
 ardchoille,  yes it also installs via the net,, and is completely up to date when finished
 ardchoille,  the only th ing to remember is when asked what you actually want to install   use the Space bar to choose and the arrow buttons to scroll..not the ENTER button
 ardchoille,  I have that cd on my maverick install in dropbox  I could try to upload to speedyshare if you want
 ardchoille,  sure
 stevecam,  no it is not that I am aware of
 stevecam,  how did you install this,,, via live cd ,,,yes?
 stevecam,  ok this is an upgrade from maverick to natty...yes?
 stevecam,  what you might want to try is going to system/administration/additional drivers... remove the driver,, reboot  and then install it again
 truepurple,  can you burn a disk there?
 truepurple,   well it should work,, what are your system specs?   cpu   video memory
 truepurple,  ok that seems like it definitly should work,, the only think i personally would question is the ati card since I know nothing about ati
 truepurple,  blinking dashes... I suppose you could try  rebooting holding down the left shift key to get to grub menu,, hit   "e"  to edit the kernel stanza adding   nomodeset  just before quiet splash and see if it boots then
 truepurple,   not sure that will help but cant hurt either
 stevecam,  it is gnome-terminal
 truepurple,  actually, probably not
 truepurple,   it would be showing an idication of what is being installed if it were installing and you have a text terminal / black screen with cursor blinking
 truepurple,   seems something is hanging
 truepurple,  ooo even if you hold down shift?
 engammalsko,  log off   put your pass word in but before you hit enter  just below change to classic session
 engammalsko,  or classic   (no effects)  and yes that's it :)
 TiagoTiago,  it should be yes
 need to break here,, be back later
 !ubuntu
 work,   wacom drivers are installed
 work,  I dont have touch screen to see if it is wacom driving that
 bizerklurker,  are you right clicking an application icon when it appears in the launcher and  choosing to keep it in launcher?
 bizerklurker,   mm  that's odd, it should hold on to them... I am not on natty right now so I cant test
 KNUBBIG,   I use  y-ppa-manager  it is helpful it only looks for ppas for the running ubuntu version
 mdmkolbe,   ok  did you try restarting x?
 mdmkolbe,   well if you restart x properly  with     ctrl+alt+F1,,, log in ,, then   sudo restart gdm    ,,, that would be the best way because it shuts down gnome  and apps properly
 work,   I dont know,, exactly,,, it should be wacom but I am not sure
 if it is not wacom we are in trouble :)
 DimaV,   I didnt see your post to respond  sorry
 DimaV,  ah ok  hold on
 DimaV, ooo the page I wanted to link you to is down ,, hold on
 DimaV,  go to the #grub channel    they may have another link for reinstalling grub
 work,   open a termina.  type   gpoint-device-settings
 work,   I believe there is a setting for  "touchfreeze" in there
 brb   nature call :)
 spikebike,  yes
 spikebike,  mm not so far no...can you detail that?  which app is open ,, what are doing ?
 spikebike,  I assume you are using compiz for this ...yes?
 spikebike,  yes I know that :)
 spikebike,  so you are settings in ccsm.. general options,,, keybinding tab,,, toggle max horizontal and vertical with keybindings ,, yes?
 spikebike,  I have not seen any issue  but to be honest,, I am not on unity right now,,,        maverick at the moment
 spikebike,  if you wait about 2 minutes and can restart into unity
 spikebike,  ok on Unity,, walk me through what you are doing
 spikebike,  thats it?  no strange happenings with that here
 spikebike,  no
 let me do a couple commands hold on
 spikebike,  darn did dist-upgrade   :) let these several packages install and I will try again in about,,,whoa   19 minutes?  darn those servers must really be bogged down ;p;
 spikebike,  let me try while it's updating
 spikebike,  nope not scrolling thiny going on
 spikebike,  let me install kazam or gtkrecord my desktop to show , maybe i am doing it wrong hold onon
 naoko,  it should be in the launcher
 naoko,   are you middle clicking it?
 naoko,  oh ok
 spikebike,  making video
 spikebike,  can you upload it to speedyshare?
 Antilect,  this one is a good channel
 MadRobot_, other than usb being painfully slow compared to cd
 R3dy,   google  ubuntu  openssl/sha.h "file not found"
 MadRobot_,  yes it is much slower,,,
 MadRobot_, unless you have usb3
 HRT,   i am not skilled at all with ati issues  ,, did you try the #radeon  channel ...yes?
 R3dy, that search should probably yeild some solution
 njbair,  wow mm  i dont banshee at all,, so I cant help with this issue,, have you asked the banshee people or googled this ..yes?
 njbair,  yes that makes sense,, i would still either or both goodle this and ask the banshee people,, you would get a better response that way
 njbair, rather "google"
 luigi_panache,  definitly here and also  you could try ##linux channel ,, where you type here type  /join ##linux
 TrentonAdams,  log off and back on again
 TrentonAdams,  oh!!  mm which video card?
 TrentonAdams, ok  is this an upgrade?
 TrentonAdams,   ok open a terminal and type   lspci | grep -i vga
 TrentonAdams,  mm  ok I know nothing about ati,, I was hoping it was nvidia because then I would suggest uninstalling that driver then reinstalling since it most likely a different driver version..hoewver for ati I  have no idea
 TrentonAdams,  the problems with upgrades is many times old config files are left behind
 TrentonAdams,  good question ,,but I dont have a good answer for you ,, sorry
 brb
 thorstenmz, yes I can verify that... probably a nux issue,, I now that logging off and back on fixes it
 guys I have a issue finally,, since lucid my cursor will ,, without warning ,, jump around the screen,, any solutions?
 lcb,  well the mouse has been changed many times with the same issue,, regardless of the manufacturer
 this has been consistently happening since lucid
 amoung other things :(
 ozanorhan,  have you looked here ?   http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=550383
 ozanorhan,  cool
 terrenceKJ,  not sure,, you could try uninstalling and then reinstalling banshee,, the problem is that ubuntu upgrades from one version to the next is consistently inconsistent,,, I always suggest clean installs,, but completely understand there are circunmstances that an upgrade is needed,,, however,, troubleshooting an upgraded system is far more  difficulte,, that said,, when you open banshee via the terminal and try to play a file,, are there er
 rors  reported?..yes?
 terrenceKJ,   wel wait
 gah
 Daniel0108,  which client?
 Daniel0108,  thats odd.. i am probably the biggest doof with any kind of networking issue,, however,,, if no one here can help,, try the ##linux channel
 ah yes Dr_Willis  is far more gifted with networking issues  :)
 Guest153289,   false positive?  mm  did you already try hitting alt+F2     gtk-window-decorator --replace   ...yes?
 linux,  in which time zone?
 Guest153289,   ok open ccsm,,Preferences   hit the reset to defaults button
 Guest153289,   is this 11.04  and is it an upgrade or clean install?
 maxagaz,  you can check if someone is still here by typing the first 2 or 3  letters of their name  and tabbing to see if it completes
 nukem,   fedora,,, opensuse,,, maybe  gentoo or  sabayon  maybe
 Guest153289,   is this 11.04  and if so ,, is it an upgrade or clean install?
 nukem,  well ubuntu is "disabled"  on the surface  you can still set a root password,, although I will probably get  hazed for saying that :)
 Sidewinder1,  that's also possible,,  I havent tried slack for some time now so I dont remember
 Sidewinder1,  many of the other distributions ask for root password long before setting user passwords
 Sidewinder1,  you can still set root password in ubuntu
 Sidewinder1,  I think that was for nukem
 nukem,  then set the root password in ubuntu
 nukem,  yes
 nukem,   well I dont its supported here
  Sidewinder1  ok cool
 nukem,  did you see my PM?
 pao,   where you type here   type  /join #nameofchannel
 syn3rgy,  in 11.04  the weather applet you mean ...yes?
 syn3rgy,  I think that is mentioned here as well as other tweaks possible   http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/things-to-tweak-fix-after-installing.html
 syn3rgy,  some of that is pretty interesting on that link
  by the way ,,, good day all  :)
 tjiggi_fo,   :)  thanks
 Glycan,   rm -rf  /nameof directory or file
 syn3rgy, ooo especially if others use that system
 syn3rgy,  :)   I believe its possible to create a  private folder,, although I have never done this  or needed to,,
 syn3rgy,   you may have to google that one unless,, which I am sure,, someone here knows the procedure
 syn3rgy,  yeah that one confused me too :)
 syn3rgy,   networking  truecrypt ,, I am a dunce :)
 DonDraper,  I hope the command you used was NOT      rm -rf  /
 ikonia,  I beg your pardon
 ikonia,  no  because I dont know what you are talking about
 darn fingers
 ikonia,   i am not sure why you want to stop something,, if you meant that command,, I would have expected an explanation as to why
 oh brother
 klingan,   Settings /preferences maybe
 klingan,  or go to the #xchat channel :)
 klingan,  right check under  Settings  / preferences
 klingan,  no problem
 Ultimate_Chaos,   I dont think so,, certainly not at this point
 Ultimate_Chaos,  if so I am unaware of it
 Ultimate_Chaos,   other than changeing the theme in appearances
 Ultimate_Chaos,  if you go  to gnome-appearance-properties you can change the system theme which should change the upper panel/dock
 bmfx1,  I assume you mean heat hot ...yes?
 Ultimate_Chaos,  probably from the PPA for gnome3  or gnomeshell
 bmfx1,   ok  this is a desktop or laptop?
 bmfx1,   what temperatures are you monitoring?
 which
 bmfx1,  which temperatures are you looking at ,, in a monitor?
 bmfx1,  well  we can test the temperatures of the hard drives if you install  hddtemp
 bmfx1,  after installing   hddtemp open a terminal   and type     sudo hddtemp /dev/sd*    or if you want that in farenheit   it would be     sudo hddtemp --u=F /dev/sd*
 bmfx1,  ok  well thats ok  but when you paste things go to pastebin.com and paste it there then   give us the link :)
 bmfx1,  no problem.... its just I believe the limit here is 2 maybe 3 lines can be pasted
 bmfx1,  that is pretty hot actually  about 120 F
 bmfx1,   do you have enough cooling in that system?
 rgr,  sure is
 bmfx1,   you might want to shut down,,, make sure the inside of the system is clean,, maybe add a fan near or on the hardrive(s)
 bmfx1,  ah I see
 bmfx1,  well check to see if any of those fans are directly over the hardrives
 bmfx1,  I actually removed my hard drive tray and put a nice 120mm fan on the tray externally because I also have a small case
 bmfx1,  it will be worth it,, those temperatures for a hard drive are pretty high,, they should be  near 27 celcius
 bmfx1,  that is a bit high for sure
 coachj,  whoa  not sure,,, there are a few benchmarks apps out there that should work ,, but onboard,, the one that comes to mind is glxgears but that by far NOT going to test much of anything useful
 bmfx1,   that's odd,,, it should not be that way,,, although I have noticed an increase in temps  since lucid
 coachj,   which video card do you have?
 coachj,  ok  just to make it easier  when you type someones name type the first 2 or 3 letters of their name and hit tab until it gets the right person
 coachj,   ok  are you on  Unity or classic gnome
 bmfx1,  driver for what ?  the hard drives?
 bmfx1,  I would start with making sure they are fan cooled well enough first and check the temps with hddtemp every so often
 coachj,   ah ok..  there may be an issue with that card then,, the ati driver should have installed automatically,,, I am by far NOT the person to deal with ati cards,, I know far too little about them.. you may have to google  that card version with uubntu 11.04  to see if it is supported for 3d accel
 Helsinkiii,   well you can put it in autohide mode via ccsm Unity plugin
 mongy,  "Jupiter" ?
 mongy,  sorry
 Monk,   "Jupiter" ?
 Monk,   how it is for you?
 Monk,   it is ubuntu based for sure   but I havent checked out the 11.04 edition yet if it exists
 Monk,  is it based on 10.04 LTS?
 ah I will goodle sorry
 Monk,   mm  did you try  regular ubuntu or are you still on  Jupiter?
 Newbee,  so you want to save that session...yes?
 Newbee,  if the session is saved then when you restart or log back on the same applications and settings will open
 Newbee,  no ,, as I understood you ,, you wanted to keep what you have on your desktop and be able to log out  and have it be the same ...yes?
 Newbee,  ah sorry i completely misunderstood
 Newa,   well  upgrading ubuntu is consistently inconsistent.. but generally the settings should stay the same
 by the way guys,, where is the save session now in 11.04 ?
  be back in a bit
 ok guys,, I have a question:)  started gimp on this fresh install for the first time and it was a bit weird,, creatd a new user account and all was fine,  will the old command to purge gimps settins work on natty?
 rather gnomes  settings
 soreau, whoa... is the unity plugin enabled?
 soreau,  that would do it :)
 soreau,  restart x it s hould come back up
 soreau,   or  in terminal  gnome-panel & disown
 soreau,  that's puzzling,, it did happen to me once but it was because of the Unity plugin in ccsm
 Mali,   then log off and log back onto classic gnome
 Mali,   ?? seriously?  all you needed to do    is log off,, type in your password  and before hitting enter change the session to Classic.. or in UNity,, although I dont reccoment this,, open a terminal and type   gnome-panel & disown
 MrADz,  there is the mini install cd  19 megs,, little to get corrupted,, however it is NOT a live cd..
 MrADz,  ah ok
 MrADz,  is it necessary for you to upgrade,,, cannot backup?
 MrADz,  the only reason is that I generally do not ask people to upgrde,, ubuntu upgrades are consistently inconsistent,, clean installs give you ,, at the very least,, the confort that any problems are not related to the upgrade itself
 Omega,  this I have seen over the years  for sure
 upgrades can be a PITA  to troubleshoot
 giacomo,  salve :)
 oCean,  you mean the pita thing?
 oCean, this I have also seen over the years... generally not thar particular one is at fault though :)
 thevishy,  in terminal      lsb_release -a
 thevishy,  that is 10.10
 thevishy,  is it important to upgrade or can you clean install with no issues?
 thevishy,  is this a netbook ?
 thevishy,   oh ! mm I have absolutely no experience with netbooks other than knowing there is no cd in them...sorry
 thevishy,  i would probably ,, in your place,  do the same with 11.04..
 fi103910,  ah what shows up when you try to boot?
 roasted,  which video card do you have on that system?
 roasted,  well   I dont think the launcher or even the upper panel can be moved,, the opton with nvidia,,of course is you could make the monitor on the right the primary monitor but that would be awkward to work with
 roasted,  well if it can be I have not found a way  on my dual monitor set up...i simply put the launcher panel into auto hide and replace with cairo dock
 roasted,  well at least that is correct... a month or so should have most of the glitches worked out,, if you find a way to move the Unity launcher let me know :)
 sebsebseb,  that also makes sense
 :)
 guy24,   is /media/sda1  a partition ,, what is it?
 fi103910,  the PAE kernel will allow a 32 bit system to see and use  more than 3.5 gigs of memory
 bluelf,  I believe there is a 11.04  ppa for xbmc,, let me see if I can find it
 bluelf,   I found a beta2  version 10.0  ppa if you want to give it a try
 bluelf,    http://www.techdrivein.com/2010/09/xbmc-100-dharma-beta-2-released-how-to.html
 bluelf,  oh ok
 sdwrage,   well you can ,, using a live cd reinstall grub after installing windows7.. although I dont know if any particular attention has to be made with windows7.. you may want to go to t he #grub channel and discuss it there,, unless someone here knows for sure
 bluelf,  then I am not sure,, have you googled  ubuntu 11.04  xbmc  ppa  to see if others are available and have been tested...yes?
 lapion,   apparenlty save session  must be enabled ,,  let me see where that is in 11.04
 I cant find it
 lapion,  well yeah if you save the session while in it,, that particular session should start up during log on even reboot I believe
 lapion,   oh!!
 lapion,  then I am puzzled
 lapion,  ah ok,, I have no experience with that at all
 ActionParsnip,  does this channel have a max "line" paste policy,, before going to pastebin,, 2  maybe 3 ?
 superMariohardco,  I am not familiar with that particular graphics tablet,,, is it wacom based?
 superMariohardco,   then it should be picked up automatically unless the manufacturer has somehow made it not be recognized as wacom
 superMariohardco,  the version of the driver  or the tablet itself?
 superMariohardco,  mm.. hold on let me see if there is a linuxwacom channel
 superMariohardco,  there is indeed  just type   /join  #linuxwacom
 superMariohardco,  I have never frequented that channel so I have no idea when or how many are online at any given time
 gsp2009,   there is a fix for the dropbox showing up hold on let me get link
 gsp2009,     http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/things-to-tweak-fix-after-installing.html
 ssharm200,  cool
 gsp2009,   there are a few tricks there worth trying out
 dp,   not sure about that unless you did  sudo apt-get autoremove --purge,, that should remove dependecies that are NOT used by other applications
 gsp2009,   very cool :)
 econdudeawesome,  did you install lxde?
 josephoenix,  personally I know nothing about ati situations... if no one here knows go to #radeon channel
 econdudeawesome,  then I would echo ... why aren't you using gdm?
 econdudeawesome,  ah I see
 ok lunch break..be back a bit later :)
 Jasonn,   you could open  gnome-keybing-properties to see the default shortcut or create a shortcut for "Search"
 Jasonn,  actually I think is is some strange letter+number combination,, I always change that to left-alt+Home  keys
 Jasonn,   you may also want to look into easystroke  gesture recognition for mouse gestures systemically
 Jasonn,  o nce you get used to that  you will be hoooked...not sure about it on laptop although i see no reason it would be excessively difficult
 sahil,  sorry I didnt see your intial post,, what is the error?
 sahil,  I have gotten this error myself ,, apparenlty those servers are down ,, or intermitently down... and you say synaptic doesnt open?
 sahil,    open a terminal     gksu --desktop /usr/share/applications/software-properties-gtk.desktop /usr/bin/software-properties-gtk
 sahil,    disable all of the ppa's you have  under the second tab,, by the way you are talking to  coz_   not ayecee   :)
 sahil,  or maybe you are speaking with both
 sahil,   after uncheckint ALL  of the PPA's in that list   close that dialog... reopen synaptic,, hit the reload button
 sahil,  once you have done that,, hit the   "Mark all upgrades"  button
 sahil,  if something is to be upgraded,,, then hit the "Apply" button
 sahil,   now,,, for the PPA's  ,, go to synaptic  Settings / repositories... second tab again,,, tick ONLY one ppa  at a time,,, Reload,,, Mark all upgrades,,,Apply,,, if it spits out the same error,, go back into  repostories and un tick that particular  PPA
 gpetrakis,   I bet you have an nvidia card...yes?
 sahil,   under  Settings / Repositories?
 gpetrakis,  that's why,,, you have to install the system onto the hard drive first then install the nvidia driver,, then  restart
 ActionParsnip,  ah very very cool..even nvidia?
 sahil,   did you untick ALL of the ppa's before?
 gpetrakis,  that is a better time,, too many glitches right now
 sahil_,   ok  close out of synaptic,,,  open a terminal,,,,    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
 rapeman,   just for info    ubottu is a bot  not a real person :)
 sahil,   still here?
 ah
 sahil,   did that work?
 sahil,   also ,, and for everyone else,,, when speaking to someone in particular    type the first 2 or 3  letters of their name,, hit Tab key to complete it  ,, this way that person will be alerted on their end
 sahil,    so did that  terminal command work?
 sahil,  ok open a terminal again
 sahil,   copy and paste t his next command into it
 sahil,     sudo mv /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin and srcpkgcache.bin
 restart synaptic
 sahil,   sorry that's wrong
 sahil,    sudo mv /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin       then    sudo mv /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin
 sahil,  then  try to reopen synaptic package manager
 sahil,  sorry my mistake
 sahil,
 sudo mv /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin /home/yourname/Desktop       the   "yourname"  is your account name
 sahil,   then
 sudo mv /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin  /home/yourname/Desktop
 sahil,  yes your account name
 broot,   not working in what manner.. it doesnt boot?
 sahil,    'yourname"  is the name that you use on the system...  not "yourname"  but the actual name ... on my system it is   cosimo321
 smitpatel24,   do you have compiz running as well?
 smitpatel24,  ok open a terminal       sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme   choose the number of the theme you want  then hit enter    restart x  or reboot and it should be fine
 sahil,   ok cool... now reopen  synaptic package manager
 sahil,   hit the RELOAD  button then the  Mark all upgrades   button
 sahil,   ooo... then I am puzzled
 sahil,   try a reboot of the system.. and try synaptic again,or,   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
 sahil,   those 2 files on the desktop can be deleted
 sahil,  not sure ,, the error points to one of the PPA  links you have
 sahil,    not sure what it is for ,, however,, what we did ,, especially the  disabling of the PPA's  should have remedied this
 sahil, `  do a complete shutdown,,, then restart the system
 sahil,  the lib folder?  I dont think you want to do that
 sahil,   well ,, you can if you have the default sources list ,, yes,
 sahil,   you can generate the list from here  http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/
 sahil,   then copy that downloaded list to the sources.list on your system after deleting the original entries
 sahil,   the /etc/apt/soruces.list   ,,, yes
 sahil,     sudo gedit   /etc/apt/sources.list
 sahil,  that is the new generated list ...yes?
 sahil_,  ah ok   then  download the generated list,,, open yours with   sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list,,, delete  the contents and replace it with the new generated list and save
 sahil_,     http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/
 mindkeep,  no  unless you find new indicators...take a look here for a few things to do    http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/things-to-tweak-fix-after-installing.html
 mindkeep,   the upper panel is NOT a gnome panel  anylonger at least not in Unity
 sahil_,  cool
 miceiken,   mm you might want to try either the alternate cd or the mini cd
 miceiken,  neither of which is a live cd
 miceiken,   I dont know  did you download the live cd/
 sahil_,   there go guy :)
 miceiken,  if you want a link to the mini cd which is only 19 megs  I have it here
 miceiken,  actually it is for any of the options and I believe server is there as well... it will eventually give a list of what you might want to install,,,arrows to scroll the list    SPACEBAR  to select an item
 miceiken,    http://dl.dropbox.com/u/132551/mini.iso
   miceiken  its only  19 megs and it does indeed install via the net
 miceiken,  i have come to rely on the mini.iso images  for time  and a bit more assureance that the download itself will most likely not be corruped  with 19 megs :)
 miceiken,  corrupted I meant
 miceiken,  it is a text install although there is a gui like thingy,,, not difficult to deal with,, just remember,,, when you get the list of possible installs  ,, space bar is the key to tick the box,,although if you choose nothing you will boot into text console and you can install from there if you likje
 like
 miceiken,   sort of... try it out,, you are bound to install it if you dont like it
 sahil_,   no   not that I amware of
 miceiken,  it is indeed  11.04   the background shoule be that purple color
 miceiken,  the ONLY issue with mini  iso  is it cannot be used on usb
 miceiken,   did you burn to disk/
 ??
 Jordan_U,  cool
 miceiken,   there you go
 Jordan_U,   ok I will try that,, it certainly will be an advantage :)
 miceiken,  all of the possible installs indeed will come later,, so give it time
 miceiken,  you wont miss it :)
 miceiken,  no problem... let me know if that works better for you
 be back in a bit
 belak,  memtes can be "not shown"  from sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
 belak,  if you open that file... near the middle of the list,, you will see several lines starting with "#Uncomment".
 belak,  read them carefully to see what options you have by Uncommenting any of the lines
 belak,   mm I thought there was one for that,, well.. probably the best thing to do is go to the #grub channel as well
 belak,  between the two channels ,, someone should have a good solution with grub2... i am not an expert with it yet
 belak,  there is a little utility name  "grub-customizer"  I have NOT tested it at all   will try now
 belak,   just in case you want to test it as well    http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/43471/how-to-configure-the-linux-grub2-boot-menu-the-easy-way/
 Dazzled1,  I think it is likely due to hardware differences,,  is this a desktop or laptop?
 Dazzled1,   not surprising,, even though most of the developers use laptops... 11.04  has exhibited different boot  speeds and glitches on several systems I have installed it on
 Dazzled1,   give it about a month,,, most glitches should have been worked out by then,  although  ,, 10.04  was LTS,, and until 12.04,, I would consider every version inbetween,, experimental
 bromium,  oo you mean they  "can't"  be accessed?
 LetsGo67,   yes  the "love" doctor  :)
 bromium,  unless you somehow inadvertently  installed or enabled some setting in firefox  I cant think of a site that is restricted
 bromium,   open firefox and go to it's settings  and check there
 bromium,  ah ok,, there;'s  your answer then,, I dont know anything about that though
 Bochum,  in Unity,, I dont think so,, it is not  a gnome-panel  under unity
 Dazzled1,  if you are using 11.04  I can verify  that it has some video issues on dual monitors...
 Dazzled1,  rather 11.04  Unity
 Dazzled1,  at this point  Unity  on dual monitors ,, especially if you are enabling dual monitors after boot,, has issues,, there is quite a bit of video  garble in that situation,, so I am not surprise it does this while you boot to dual set up
 Dazzled1,  I believe  it is related to  nux   which is an open-source java toolkit which was necessary , in part , for helping compiz to work on Unity
 Dazzled1,  nux allows for " and efficient  XML pricessing"  unquote :)
 Dazzled1,   rather  "an efficient"
 processing
 Dazzled1,  I simply switched to classic gnome  ,,, much easier to deal with dual set ups..
 tomekh,   sorry ,, I dont use xfce
 Dazzled1,  well  you dont have to swtich to a previous version...simply log off  and log onto classic :)
 tomaw,  oh!  i didnt see that problem,, how does it show itself?
 Dazzled1,  ph phew!  I thought you were going to downgrade :)
 tomekh,   that was meant for you    how does it show itself in nautilus?
 AndroiDoughBoy,   I cant help with this issue,, I have never used wubi  ,, I am sure others here can help
 JohnFlux,   I have said this many times... the one consistent thing with upgrading one version to the next, is that it is consistently inconsistent,,, If you can,, I suggest a clean install after backing up any important documents  etc
 JohnFlux,   yeah  I agree,, however,,  I still advocate  clean installs,,, but yeah  many people rely on upgrades,,, the issue becomes troubleshooting  after that.
 JohnFlux,   I understand and i dont think you are alone with this ,, but I dont have a reason or solution for it ...sorry
 marcelC,   I enable all repositories   and so far no issues
 JohnFlux,  no problem... hope you can resolve this without a clean install
 ramshot,   you mean for application search or file search?
 ramshot,   well in classic,, you can go to  system / preferences / keyboard shortcuts and look for "Search"  and put in a keybinding you like ,, this is bring up the file search dialog
 ramshot,  it is also available under the Places menu   "Search for files "
 ramshot,  understood,,
 i_is_broke,  open ccsm   click on the Unity plugin  set it to autohide
 syockit,   lsb_release -a
 syockit,   oh!  just tried it
 syockit,  ok did you install    lsb-release  ....yes?
 here is a small tweak guide for unity    http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/things-to-tweak-fix-after-installing.html
 Jeff_Mosawy,  well what is the issue?
 REK,   did you open screensaver  and untick the boxes,, bottom one first
 REK,  gnome-screensaver-properties
 REK,  ?  mm let me check here hold on
 REK,    gnome-screensaver-preferences
 REK,   there should be 2 tick boxes,, untick the bottom one first then the top   that will prevent ,,, I believe ,, what you described
 REK,  ooo... mm then I am puzzled sorry
 REK,   ok,, just ask again,, someone else most likely has had expreience with this issue
 ctrl+F1  etc
 ctrl+alt+F1
 etc  I believe
 mang0,   then you arent
 mang0,   you might want to try the mini.iso image...its only 19 megs and downloads directly from the servers
 mang0,      the mini  is just 19 megs... installs from the net,, aka   netinstal
 mang0,  it does indeed
 mang0,   however,, it will ask what you want to install at one point,, it is a list,, arrows  scroll the list  SPACE bar ticks the box
 mang0,  would you like to try that??
 mang0,     http://dl.dropbox.com/u/132551/mini.iso
 mang0,  burn that to disk...it will not work on usb ,, even though i have tried over and again
 mang0,   I have tired  over and again to burn this to usb without success
 mang0,  it burns fine but refuses to boot
 ActionParsnip,  yes and  still i do recall reading somewhere that the mini.iso will not work on usb  and I always use netbootin
 mang0,  no not that I am aware of,, you are not able to burn cd?
 ActionParsnip,  wow then I will have to troubleshoot the issue at some point
 mang0,  if you burn that mini.iso ,, even though it is on ly 19 megs  it will always install the most current updates
 ActionParsnip,  tried over and again.. but if you have done it then that just gives me incentive to troubleshoot it :)
 ActionParsnip,  yeah I realize that,, but the mini.is cool :)
 chrome_,   gnome  3 uses mutter   11.04  decided to not use mutter and replace it with compiz as the compositor
 deostroll,   you can install netbootin  or  I believe its called  image writer or go to system/administraton/startup disk creator
 deostroll,  ah ok
 !ask | ablaze
 !filesystem
 need to break here   be back later
 l403,  open a terminal type   alsamixer ,, see if you can adjust the sound there
 iggyology,  the command would be    gnome-session-save --kill
 iggyology,  also ctrl+alt+F1 will kill the applications including gnome and nautilus properly,, ctrl+backspace will not
 rather ctrl+alt+backspace
 iggyology,  so if you dot ctrl+alt+F1  log in then     sudo restart gdm
 [snake],   make sure the monitor is plugged in firmly and also make sure the power plug to the video card, if any,  is plugged in,, these two things will cause that monitor to report that
 [snake],  no guranatee those are the issues  though
 [snake],  ooo that's odd
 hwilde,   that should be enabled by default... when did this stop working?
 hwilde,  in all honesty  I only use classic gnome and it works there,, I will have to log onto Unity to test it  hold on
 hwilde,   well on my Unity set up ,, middle click paste works fine
 hwilde,  is this a clean install or an upgade from 10.10 ??
 coun,  I am not ...sorry
 Brandano,   one application/utility you may want to look into is easystroke,,, gesture recognition
 Brandano,  it is by far ,, in my opinion ,, the top companion application for linux / compiz
 Brandano,   opening applications  closing etc,,,  Unity is a pain in my opinion for ease of use  ,, easystroke makes it far less  of a  learning curve
 Braiam,  aj pl
 ah ok
 Braiam,  well there is another distrobution in the works UGR  ubuntu gnome remix   using gnome3
 Braiam,   sorryy wrong nick
 Brandano,   UGR   ubuntu -gnome-remix  is in the works
 Limada,   several ways,, in terminal      sudo nautilus,, then you can just drag and into that directory  or paste it there
 Limada,  the other way is to   sudo mov name/of/webfolder  /var/www
 Limada,  sorry that is  sudo mv  not mov
 Limada,  no problem
 Limada,  yeah its easy when you do      sudo nautilus... but just as easy with the sudo mv  stuff as well
 Limada,  ok at this point..you will have to ask someone else.. my feet are a bit wobbly with networking issues of any kind
 dibs,  can you be a bit more specific?  is this nvidia?
 dibs,  ah someone had this issue the other day,, I dont recall the solution,, gah
 dibs,  yeah not doubt,, trying to see if I remember the solution,, but no luck  so far,, so in the meantime ,, someone else can take this if they remember
 dibs,  I am vaguely remember that it was solved for that one person,, i dont think I was the one who solved it  however
 dibs,   I do recall asking to also join #radeon channel
 dibs,  he may have gotten it solved there :)
 Kevin147,   get a new monitor...yes?
 Kevin147,  well not trying to be  flippant about it,, but ubuntu didnt fry the monitor
 Kevin147,  which video card do you have?
 Kevin147,  in terminal    lspci | grep -i vga
 Kevin147,   wait apparenlty you are not on linux ,, am I correct?
 Kevin147,   yeah ,, shows what they know
 Kevin147,  ah ok
