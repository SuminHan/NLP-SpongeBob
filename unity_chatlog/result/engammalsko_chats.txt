 Hi, how do I change my 11.04 menu back to the 10.10 menu? The one with two panels.
 Aha, is that all?

 I don't have the close, minimize, maximize etc.

 Can I change the scroll to classic scroll?
 Can I change my scrolls to the classis scroll?
 PLEASE HELP!!!!!
 I can't move my windows anymore.
 I used this command: sudo su
  echo “export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0″ > /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80overlayscrollbars
 ohsix: Thanks.
 But, how do I change scrollbars?
 To classic scrollbars.
 Or more importent. Why can't I use ctrl+alt+t to open the shell? I have looked up my hotkeys and it's right but it doesn't work.
 Why do I just have an orange dot as background process icon?
 VLC and Skype are just dots.
 But under icons are working, like pidgin and KTorrent.
 I use Gnome theme on Ubuntu 11.04
