 hi, i just branched a bzr repo from lp which says i should run ./configure, but there is only a configure.ac, what to do?
 uberfrau: what do you mean?
 uberfrau: there is nothing special hidden, just .bzrignore and .bzr
 uberfrau: normally i know how to compile, but i'm not into autoconf
 xD
 .oO(ah running autoconf generates a configure script)
