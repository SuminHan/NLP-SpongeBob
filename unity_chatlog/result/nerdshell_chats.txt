 I try to install firefox 4, I download the firefox.tar.bz and I don't no how to install it, I don't find the make file, any help please?
 bazhang: 10.10
 bazhang: thanks a lot, but what's the problem with the .tar I downloaded from mozilla.com
 Dr_Willis: you advise me not installing it?
 Dr_Willis: ok, I just wanna understand why the tar.gz doesn't work, shouldn't it contain a makefile normally ?
 Dr_Willis: I didn't get you... when I extract it, I found a folder named "firefox" there are binaries, images in it, how can I install it (just to know about it, I'll use the PPA m√©thode)
 Dr_Willis: ok, thanks, why should the PPA be better then ?
 Dr_Willis: system wide?  what does that exactly mean please?
 Dr_Willis: yeah okay, I got it, I got it, but why doesn't Canonical support it yet?
 welloong:  who can you display special commands instead of making Nickserv interpreting them, like you did now ?
 Dr_Willis: okay I installed it yesterday, but I had wifi problems, so I got back to Maverik
 Dr_Willis: so if I understand, for software, we can install with a .deb file, with a make file or with a binary, and the binary is not system wide, right?
 ajaytripi: just post your question directly
 Dr_Willis: where do I have to put the binaries to be system wide? PPA do not download and install .deb ?
 nerdshell: so the debs are actually the best and the easiest way, right?
 ajaytripi: why don't you try the upgrade ?
 ajaytripi: when do you exactly get the error?
 ajaytripi: sur the cd was not damaged, I did a fresh install quit several times, and I never got errors
 ajaytripi: sur you burned the right OSI, the 32 or the 64?
 (appears that this Natty creats a lot of havoc)
 ajaytripi: I don't see what you could do but burning a new OSI...
 ajaytripi: sorry

 edbian: how can I change my interpreter ? maybe, moving from bash to zsh ??
 edbian: okay, needs a reboot ?
