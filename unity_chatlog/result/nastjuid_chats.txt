 dangit, I forgot to check for previous versions in apt. Is it possible to specify the previous version of gnome for installation or is this new design in 11.04 the only version of gnome I can use?
 Johan2: if you find a configuration tool with more than two radio buttons, let me know
 hypetech: the panel optiosn are in ccsm?
 hypetech: or does that not include menu item customization? I can't seem to add launchers to it. Pretty sure I"m just doing it wrong.
 hypetech: ah ha! thanks
 !torrent
 In the alternate downloads -> bit torrent download section, there are two 10.04.2 Desktop i386 links, but no 10.04.2 x86_64 desktop link
 oh sweet. I can install with the alternate cd and not have to use the new gnome
 hypetech: oh, I must have missed the option. I'll check that out thanks :)
 ohsix: thanks for that clarification
 ! thanks :)
 Would the 570 be tesla as well?
 jdahm: the tesla series cards would start with a C for the model number. C2070, C2050 . Is your card a GeForce GTX/Fermi based card?
 jdahm: oh, I see in the log. if you still have trouble with the card, let us know
 OchoZero9: find a closer/faster mirror
 supposedly apt provides libapt-pkg-libc6, but if I get the package and look inside, it's not there?
 crazed]psyc: check out madwifi
 crazed]psyc: http://madwifi-project.org
 Sexygurl2furl: which java?
 bikcmp: you could find a closer/faster mirror
 I switched my desktop switching method to Desktop Cube, and chose yes to enable opengl, and the other windows that popped up, but I"ve lost my window borders and can no longer move or resize windows. Setting things back in ccsm does not fix this. any ideas?
 botcity: was that to me?
 ah, sweet got the defaults back
