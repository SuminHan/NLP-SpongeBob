 cordoval_: gnome-session-save --kill         <-- that work?
 cordoval_: you can also restart gdm with "sudo service gdm restart"
 lapion: oh yeah i guess restarting gdm would make it behave like a new boot instead of a logout...
 lapion: i havent even tried it, and ive been on natty for months :P
 Herbs: what's that have to do with anything i said?
 lapion: ooh i didnt know about that
 cordoval_: yes
 cordoval_: did you see what lapion just said about hitting escape to make it not autologin?
 Herbs: nowhere in there did i suggest rebooting the box
 cordoval_: umm... "hit escape to stop autologin"?
 Herbs: i was saying that if you log out but gdm stays running, it knows that and doesnt autologin again. normally, only the first login after boot is autologin, but i hadnt considered the case where the gdm service has been restarted while the system's running

 nishanth: /join
 locodir-user: when it's ready
 tensorpudding: no
 it'll be released when all the CDs come out right
 and no sooner
 cordoval_: this channel is not for natty
 cordoval_: if you ran some random executable from the internet and overwrote a chunk of your compiz, i really dont think reinstalling unity is going to fix that
 BATMAN_: there's a PPA. also this channel isnt for 11.04
 cordoval_: sudo apt-get install --reinstall unity
 bazhang: i know
 cordoval_: please stop asking 11.04 questions in here
 madhu: hello
 madhu: is there a reason you keep highlighting me with nothing more than the word "hi"?
 tensorpudding: please ask in the natty channel
 madhu: questions are to be answered by whomever can. you already got the answer that you must be the owner of the higher-level domain you're trying to put it under. you dont own ubuntu.com so you can't
 madhu: buy a domain name. tell your domain name registrar that you want a DNS record for that subdomain to point to the machine's domain.
 madhu: buy it
 madhu: i buy my domain names from 123-reg.co.uk
 isout1: no
 madhu: pay money to a domain name registrar
 madhu: its usually about $10/year

 vibhav, yeah i have windows with me
 bah
 vibhav: sorry i fail at copy paste
 oh i see it scrolled while i copied
 vibhav: i copied what someone else said because the text scrolled while i was copying
 vibhav: i dont have a windows box
 vibhav: as i said twice already, saying that to you was the result of accidentally copying what someone ELSE said
 illmortal: dpkg -L  packagename    <-- will list all files installed by the package
 vibhav: uh, im headed to bed dude. dunno why you need to talk to me
 Herbs: no
 Herbs: you give it the packagename directly and then can grep for a file within it
 IanWizard-Mobile: Natty will be released at some point while it is 28 April in at least one timezone on the planet Terra in the system Sol
 ayecee: it's the standard line for the last 4 years, and it's held true ;-)
 nashj: Natty will be released at some point while it is 28 April in at least one timezone on the planet Terra in the system Sol
 illmortal: cli would include it doesnt have a gui.....
 illmortal: erm, s/include/imply/
 IanWizard-Mobile: yes
 ayecee: 6.06 was moved by a few months, but that was decided a lot earlier than 24h before
 nashj: what is this "scheduled" of which you speak?
 nashj: it's ready when all the CDs come out not-broken
 illmortal: put a \ before the space, problem solved
 nashj: when it's ready
 nashj: i cannot predict the future to determine when the builds will work
 nashj: get me a crystal ball if you want a better answer!
 illmortal: yes
 Genghiz: Natty will be released at some point while it is 28 April in at least one timezone on the planet Terra in the system Sol
 Genghiz: yep
 Genghiz: actually i think its +13/-12
 Genghiz: there is a UTC+13 timezone after all
 Nabbies: Natty will be released at some point while it is 28 April in at least one timezone on the planet Terra in the system Sol
 proq: and thats only UTC-8! (though itd be PDT right now so -7)... imagine in UTC-12!
 30 more potential hours
 Bob___: release team is also in BST, so probably before they go to bed :)
 proq: 7am
 histo: that was the question, yes
 rww: they all fly to london
 histo: what? proq asked what time it is in britain *right now*
 histo: so i rounded to the nearest hour... which is 7am. fine so its 6:55am technically, but close enough
 histo: though i have no idea why i'm doing the `date` command's job
 histo: so pgraner did what? swam there?
 histo: a few key people do go to london for it
 BarbaraBush_: before its the 29th in the last timezone
 BarbaraBush_: its not the 28th in california yet
 BarbaraBush_: nor in the very last timezone, which is utc-12. still got 30 hours before the 28th ends!
 histo: there've been respins of the ISOs going on and language pack rebuilds and stuff
 histo: thats a compiz setting
 tanath: you can turn off the maximise on screen edge by changing your screen edge bindings in compiz
 aroman: is this a mac? there's a tool somewhere for reversing their use
 aroman: and in ubuntu...
 aroman: yeah, we have a way to handle mac keyboards. lemme look it up again
 aroman: echo 0 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode
 aroman: oh actually 1, not 0
 aroman: http://superuser.com/questions/79822/how-to-swap-the-fn-use-of-function-keys-on-al-apple-keyboard-in-linux
 aroman: dunno if thatll work on a non-apple keyboard though. experiment time i guess
 Barbarabush: a day is 49 hours :)
 econnell: what are you on about?
 econnell: we have a way to get packages into stable releases
 !arb
 bah
 econnell: submit your package to the application review board if you want to get it into a stable release
 g105b: Natty will be released at some point while it is 28 April in at least one timezone on the planet Terra in the system Sol
 g105b: party in #ubuntu-release-party
 econnell: it didnt exist a year and a half ago
 econnell: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PostReleaseApps/Process
 econnell: this process is 6 months old. i have no idea how you purport to have done it a year before it existed
 econnell: if you dont want to maintain it, did you at least file a needs-packaging bug in ubuntu or (better) a work-needing bug in debian?
 econnell: i for one have not the slightest idea what app you are talking about
 (i also probably dont care if im getting on fine without it)
 econnell: but really the bit about "they'll take on their own responsibility" ... the majority of ubuntu devs are volunteers taking care of the packages they care about and ignoring others. the ones being forced to take care of certain packages for their job are in the minority and since your software isnt part of the default install, they won't be forced to touch it at all
 econnell: not particularly. nobody except the canonical employees are REQUIRED to do anythng for ubuntu
 econnell: fame?
 econnell: dunno
 econnell: im just saying, nobody in particular has any responsibility to anyone else when it comes to what they package, unless its their *job*. its volunteer work. people can CHOOSE to take it or live it
 DirtyDawg: some time later today
 econnell: please don't use offensive language
 econnell: by the way, ive scrolled back pretty far in the backlog to as far back as i can see you first talking, and i dont actually see you ever saying what software it is you want someone to package, so i guess i wont be picking it up as my next upload
 histo, econnell: and for that matter, just ask that it be packaged for *debian* -- no reason to package for debian and ubuntu separately. if its in debian, it'll be sync'd to ubuntu automatically
 whatever "it" is (i still don't know)
 x3464: it was comparison to the mentally disabled that was offensive
 econnell: i still dont know what your software is, but i will say "thank you for actually bothering with accessibility, unlike just about everyone else"
 econnell: i learned a few weeks ago that 10.10 wasnt installable at all if you're blind and 11.04 is only slightly installable
 econnell: is that the name of the software?
 econnell: yeah i know about vinux. ubuntu-accessibility team works with them. im asking "is mangler the name of the software you've been ranting about for the last half hour without naming it?"
 econnell: thanks. like i said earlier, i scrolled back as far as i saw you talking, and the earliest i see is you telling qin that you deleted....something.. and then just usng "it" to refer to the software so...
 econnell: well i am an ubuntu dev, but in general we prefer *not* to add new packages just to ubuntu, rather they go through debian so A) more users get it and B) more hands to help
 lapion: Isle of Man
 lapion: bah not you
 lwizardl: Isle of Man
 lwizardl: though their office is in london
 Popopo: you havent asked a question
 Popopo: or at least not a question beyond "can i ask a question?" level
 Popopo: i think you need to use manual since once there are 4 primary partitions, you cant fit any more at all. you need to get rid of a primary and put in an extended, then you can put lots in the extended one
 Popopo: possibly one of these is already extended, even
 Popopo: but the 4-primary-max is just plain a hard drive thing, not an ubuntu thing
 DarkStar1: dpkg -L slapd    <-- maybe there's a sample config file somewhere?
 DarkStar1: thatd probably be a sensible place to put example files
 Ziber: 1) LTS only show other LTS by default and 12.04 isnt out yet. you can change this in software sources 2) you cant go from 10.04 to 11.04 directly
 Ziber: see #1 in what i said
 Ziber: change the update settings in the software sources config thing
 KlingaN: install updates. the end.
 KlingaN: yep
 KlingaN: "alpha" is just a name for a certain point in time during the dev cycle. if you kept up with installing updates the whole time, you've moved from alpha to beta to final automatically
 pdg1: #ubuntu-server
 KlingaN: if you have no updates available, you're at final
 plustax: lucid is an lts release so only shows other lts releases by default
 plustax: in the software sources thing in the menu, change update settings to show non-lts releases. then you can upgrade to 10.10
 plustax: from there to 11.04. you cannot skip 10.10
 plustax: 10.10 isnt lucid
 KlingaN: lsb = linux standards base
 KlingaN: its a standards body that mostly just went with "red hat's way is standard!" *roll eyes* but decreeing a standard place to put release info (as opposed to /etc/redhat_release and whatever debian's was) was handy
 KlingaN: pretty global
 KlingaN: never noticed before that anything adobe just gives away must be really slow and memory-hoggish?  i mean...flash... acrobat reader...
 r000t: could also be that unity has improved a lot over the last 6 months, like from crashing every few minutes to um, actually working?
 doodle: you cant install onto an NTFS file system
 doodle: if you want to mount an NTFS storage device automatically, you can set that up post-install
 doodle: ok i should clarify:  you cant install *directly* on an ntfs file system.  if you use Wubi from Windows, you can install into an ext4-formatted file on an NTFS drive
 doodle: no, just set it up in /etc/fstab after you install
 doodle: wont it let you just leave empty space?
 doodle: you could pick any available one for now if you wanted to setup an empty partition and then format it after the install
 Ahmuck: you're going to need to get 3D drivers for your vm
 Ahmuck: vmware and vbox both have extensions for installing in the guest OS for that
 Adis45: the new shell in 11.04
 biami: umm... #defocus?
 jsebean: it's a shell on top of gnome
 jsebean: gnome applications and libraries and services are all still there
 doodle: depends how many partitions you have already
 doodle:  you can have up to 4 primary or 3 primary + 1 logical and the logical containing a LOT of extended
 doodle: primary & logical have no bearing on how you use it in most cases (exception is that windows refuses to boot from logical)
 doodle: if you have 3 primary already, then id make it logical
 doodle: you have 4 primary?
 doodle: youd need to delete one and replace it with a logical then put a few extended in there.  (this is not an ubuntu thing, just a hard disk thing)
 doodle: whoops, its logicals inside extendeds, not other way around, but either way:  4 big things allowed.
 doodle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning#PC_partition_types
 nerdshell: try plugging into a wired network and starting up the hardware driver manager. it'll search the internet for a wireless driver
 nerdshell: is your rfkill switch enabled?
 nerdshell: and have you rebooted since installing the drivers
 !language | cyoz1
 nerdshell: the "turn off wireless because im in an airplane / want to save battery" button or switch
 nerdshell: can try    sudo rfkill --unblock all
 Rehan: right
 Rehan: unity is a compiz plugin
 doodle: whatever you want it to be named. you can always change this later
 doodle: should even be able to type it in
 doodle: if you want it to show like a flash drive would, then put it under /media
 doodle: it wont let you type in there?
 ohsix: whats the emergency?
 Rehan: 6.06 was delayed by two months
 Rehan: but no release will be bug-free, when few people test more than a month before release :(
 Rehan: well, no release will be bug-free, period ;-) but having bug reports with actual time to complete them is nice!
 (also help with fixing them is also nice. if you want to help join #ubuntu-bugs)
 nerdshell: is your wifi network running on a very high channel?
 Rehan: yes
 nerdshell: like, i think channel 13 is europe-only (or only recently added to the US?) ... in which case your driver might not look that high by default
 Rehan: lots of replies to requests for checking on reproducibility of a reported bug in the devel release (so we know whether to spend resources on it) are of the form "ok, well i'll let you know when its beta" or "i'll check after the stable release" .. which is way too late
 Rehan: please do feel free to file bugs on what you think is wrong and also ones for the Hundred Papercuts project on usability bugs
 dotblank: we can do a lot of workarounds in the kernel
 dotblank: i only personally know how to do a few audio ones, but i know other subsystems use quirks as well
 dotblank:  the regression potential depends on the manufacturer. there are some *cough*apple*cough* who like to give multiple pieces of hardware the same hardware IDs and revision numbers
 Guest35234: how many thousands of people do you think are trying to download from the same servers as you?
 Guest35234: itll be slow for the next week
 !language | adwonw
 OchoZero9: torrent?
 jiltdil: ccsm
 jiltdil: the compiz config settings manager. unity is a compiz plugin and so is in there
 jiltdil: should be able to alt+f2 "ccsm"
 Sexygurl2furl: download links are on ubuntu.com
 geekyogi: download links for old releases are on cdimage.ubuntu.com
 Sexygurl2furl: or use update manager as normal
 geekyogi: watch the language
 geekyogi: if all it is is that you dont like unity, you can use classic ubuntu
 geekyogi: there's an option on the login screen
 Sexygurl2furl: if you're on 10.10 it should. if its not showing, click hte check for new updates button
 Sexygurl2furl: it doesnt show "hey there's a new release" at the top, above where it lists the normal updates?
 |Seth|: compiz config settings manager, aka "ccsm"
 andeeeuk: like slowness? thatd be due to everyone trying at once
 andeeeuk: could try another mirror if youre having trouble reaching your usual one
 andeeeuk: there are a lot of repo mirrors. in the software sources thing, you can ask it to search for the fastest one, then use that
 kyo22: it just wants to know if youre using a US-style keyboard, german, british, etc.
 Gosha: because options confuse users, according to the koolaid gnome & canonical both drank
 matto1990: dont have any windows open over it?
 matto1990: when you open a window does it look more like the screenshot?
 matto1990: ooh oh i see what you mean
 matto1990: i thought you meant the little bar versus the whole thing.... i guess they resized it? alt+right-click  and drag?
 tucemiux: yes
 progre55: wubi doesnt install to a partition, so there isn't one
 progre55: his old ubuntu is just a very very large file on the windows partition
 progre55: same way you remove any program in windows, the add/remove applications window
 progre55: np
 hypodermia: you can stop that
 hypodermia: scoffing at girls on the internet isn't really necessary, especially when ubuntu has an entire subproject devoted to bringing in more women contributors and making them feel welcome enough to stay
 Julie972: hey by the way, are you aware of the existence of the Ubuntu Women Project? its aim is to help women get more involved in Ubuntu
 Julie972: http://women.ubuntu.com
 edbian: taken care of
 edbian: it was IdleOne
 edbian: what?
 edbian: IdleOne got rid of the spammer
 jensp: you can edit /etc/init/smbd.conf to add a dependency on the cups service
 zus: sudo do-release-upgrade to go to a new version
 zus: sudo do-release-upgrade
 tamale_: sounds like a bug in the shotwell package. sudo dpkg -P shotwell       <-- try that?
 tamale_: could you "gksudo gedit /var/lib/dpkg/status" and find shotwell in there and paste its whole section to paste.ubuntu.com and give me te link?
 tamale_: imvery confused because i dont see a duplicate depends
 Defusal_: bash is efault login shell. its installed y default
 Defusal_: /bun/sh is dash because its smaller. less overhead than bash on running boot scripts. things go faster
 Defusal_:  if you want to make /bin/sh use bash instead of dash, just change the symlink
 Defusal_: but be warned it will make things like boot slower because bash is huge
 Defusal_: bash is the default login shell. see /etc/passwd
 Defusal_: hm then sounds like your vps provider futsed with /etc/passwd O_o -- change that back
 eekTheCat: thats the way if you want to change /bin/sh's behaviour. but if you want to change login shells, then /etc/passwd
 i always forget about usermod...
 pestilence: chroot in & dpkg --get-selections > file
 pestilence: flash drive?
 pestilence: or just somewhere on the live filesystem for now, then ftp it somewhere or pastebin it
 pestilence: oh...once you're chrooted you cant get to running...right... can you mount a flash drive inside the chroot?
 pestilence: or does "pastebinit" happen to be one of the things installed on there? in which case, pipe to that?
 pestilence: possibly the chroot might have a writable /tmp?
 pestilence: yes
 pestilence: whoops
 LibreMan: yes, debian and ubuntu packages differ
 LibreMan: names are teh same. versions are different. so if you mean filename, then different
 LibreMan: yeah
 nerdshell: with a space in it like that? a syntax error
 nerdshell:  ./setup.sh would execute a script named setup.sh
 FoolsRun: -c i think
