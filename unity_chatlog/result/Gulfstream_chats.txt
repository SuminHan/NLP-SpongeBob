 I am experiencing issues playing DVDs. I installed the plugin, and the video slightly works, but the image doesn't look good and the audio skips. How do I fix this?
 uberfrau: Yes
 uberfrau: I think it may be the hardware
 uberfrau: should I try to clean the lense?
 uberfrau: the video didn't work no matter which movie or OS
 yes
