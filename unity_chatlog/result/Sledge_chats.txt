 is there a  way i can change these hotcorner thingies
 usually you can just right click on them change their settings top, right bottom, left all that jazz
  I HATE FLASH
 ikonia,  well sorry, but it stopped working after the upgrade, and i had it working just so good.
 muneeb,  are you having a problem with flash after the upgrade?
 muneeb did you use the .so file?
 muneeb, yes same exact problem im having
 Halt use rythmbox
 muneeb,  no i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling
 Usually i can just right click on a launcher panel and change the size settings, and things liek that color, text font.. but for some reason i can't do that anymore, and all my colors and sizes hhave changed with unity..
 has anyone figured out how to navigate easily with this UNITY

 you mean this?
 and my SEE Desktop icon is gone!
 grr.
 won't let me add anything to it either
 does anyone know how i can stop this panel from auto hiding
 ccsm
 ok
 esx,  was going to say right clicking does not work
 esx, already installed.
 tatzenblogde,  since the upgrade right clicking on the panel's does nothing.
 esx, desktop ? what do you mean?
 Cool
 thanks
 uh oh
 i cant even get ALT+F2
 unity panel is gone
 ok muneeb i figured out how to login what was that dpkg command again?
 muneeb,  thanks
 muneeb, still didnt work..
 muneeb,  if i do ctrl alt f2, it takes me to a black screen and i can't figure out how to get back to chat once i get in there
 muneeb,  black login screen..
 muneeb,  ok well.. i did the command and still i have nothing
 muneeb,  ok yes that worked.
 i can go back and forth now from terminal and GUI
 muneeb,  yes
 muneeb,  i executed the command dpkg-reconfigure, no terminal
 i figured that command sudo dpkg-reconfigure unity would get me back to default, but still no change in the GUI
 rgr, so could you please tell me how to put in the defaults?
 muneeb,  i did .. didnt work
 probably compiz-- replace
 yes
 i think i had this problem before
 rgr, i was in ccsm and i canged some settings and conflicts were popping up left and right with desktop cube, and now all of a sudden i cannot run any programs with alt+f2, the unity panel's are gone and im left with nothing but a desktop
 muneeb,  the problem is i cannot run CCSM
 escott the only thing i can access now is virtual terminal
 sudo apt-get install unity ?
 escott,  yes
 said unable to locate package CCSM
 muneeb,  it said it was unable to locate package ccsm
 muneeb,  ccsm is only the manageing GUI applette im sure compiz needs to be reinstalled anyway
 muneeb,  fixed.
 stil can't figure out how to add stuff
 sudo apt-get install gnome2
