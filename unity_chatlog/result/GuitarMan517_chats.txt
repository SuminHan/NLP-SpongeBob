 I recently updated to 11.04 and tried to move to Gnome 3..now I can only get in via LXDE..how can I restore to base 11.04?
 ActionParsnip: I removed the Gnome3 ppa...how is the best way to reinstall? I am a bit of a noob..and don't want to loose any of my data.
 ActionParsnip: ?
 Dcite: I can still..I just wan't to reinstall the original packages without wiping everything. Is there a relatively simple way?
 want* :D
 Dcite: What are the commands to do this?
 Dcite: Ok, could it result in loss?
 Dcite: Ok, I'll give it a go
 Dcite: In LXDE if I try to pull up the udate manager I get - 'E:Type 'ain' is not known on line 3 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gnome3-team-gnome3-natty.list'
 ActionParsnip: Sure
 ActionParsnip: You just want me to open that file as text and copy the contents?
 ActionParsnip: This what you wanted? - http://pastebin.com/NyFJUexd
 ActionParsnip: An unresolvable problem occurred while initializing the package information.  Please report this bug against the 'update-manager' package and include the following error message:  'E:Type 'ain' is not known on line 3 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gnome3-team-gnome3-natty.list'
 ActionParsnip: Aren't the first three comments?
 Dcite: http://pastebin.com/uGFw0icW
 Dcite: I think thats the problem.. :)
 Dcite: Remove line 3?
 Dcite: It wont let me edit it o_0
 Dcite: Ok
 Dcite: Ok, thats working. Ran ppa purge on the Gnome3 ppa
 Dcite: Should I try sudo aptget install ubuntu-desktop now?
 Dcite: Made those changes..rebooting. Thanks for your help
 ActionParsnip: Thanks
