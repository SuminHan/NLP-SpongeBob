 Hi is it required to  install ATi/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics Driver or not if i am able to use unity
 i am able to run 3D games successfully then i hope not required to install ATI driver
 if i install i am not able to use unity it says clearly that i dont have hardware card but i have 215mb on board graphics card available
