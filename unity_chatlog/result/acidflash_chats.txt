 hello everyone
 i would like to have upstart launch a software called squid LAST in the order of things to launch
 what is the way to do that
 DasEi: it never gets to the line
 Dr_Willis: there is no squid.conf in /etc/init...
 this is what i did, i made a small bash script to check if hte squid.pid exists.. if it doesnt... then start the service.. i added that to crontab and it checks it every minute....
