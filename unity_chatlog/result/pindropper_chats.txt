 harrihu: i know.. its a bit of a fix if you have problems with wired. but really, ubuntu will notify you of possible problems or updates once you connect. maybe a phone/usb/3g/edge sharing , even for 10 mins might help.
 harrihu: i was having similar problems. i updated using the update manager... and now it works fine.
 harrihu: theres your problem then. if the internets not on but your wifi is... strange as it is, at least in my experience, ubuntu refuses to connect
 harrihu: thats what i said, if the routers not connected to the internet, ubuntu sometimes wont connect to your wifi either.
 harrihu: you might also want to try and do "edit connections" and add one in manually and try.
 harrihu: is your wireless network a hidden one by any chance? try create new wireless, or hidden wireless connection and see if that helps
 harrihu: read my previous two suggestions
 i am trying to figure out a way to execute a command on a double key press. Is this at all possible through bash? The keyboard shortcut mappings don't provide a way to capture double key presses.
 harrihu: and...?
 harrihu: does it even attempt to connect? you know once you've added the network... does it try to connect?
 harrihu: did it ever work?
 harrihu: ah . in that case there is a very good chance you need proprietary drivers. which you wont know until you connect. you might want to try connecting through a lan cable and get it to work.

 i followed the instructions for installing and configuring LAMP, available here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP , but when i browse to http://localhost i get a 403 forbidden error. Anyone have any ideas? (Before i did any configuration changes after install, as specified in the doc, it was working.)
 cdbs: ok.
 cdbs: it gives me an error. it says "/etc/init.d/apache2: 1: ServerName: not found"
 cdbs: ok
 cdbs: i changed servername to 127.0.0.1 from localhost, and reran the command to restart, same error!
 mknarr: i just installed it. it was working post install. then i configured site to a new location and all hell broke lose
 mknarr: yes i did. to /home/myname/public_html
 mknarr: i dont think there was any permission change mentioned in the doc. so i dint have to do anything as such permission related. but i did check the permissions on the public_html file it has public access
 mknarr: it gives me an error. it says "/etc/init.d/apache2: 1: ServerName: not found"
 mknarr: i now did sudo pkill apache2 to force shut. how do i restart it. sudo apache2 start doesnt work
 mknarr: cool. thanks
 mknarr: ok thanks
 mknarr: ack! wont start either now. same error.
 mknarr: sorry. waiting.
 mknarr: i cp'd the file to /etc/..../sites-available/mysite. then disabled default and enabled mysite. in mysite i changed the dirs to the point to home/myname/public_html
 mknarr: i pretty much followed  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  to the letter
 i am trying to add an option to one of my functions i wrote into ~/.bashrc. I am trying to do this by comparing the first arg by using if [[ "$1"= "-browse"]]; then do so and so. but every time i run it, bash says [["-browse"="-browse"]] command not found. what am i doing wrong?
 escott, thanks. and thanks
 escott: it worked with the spaces ! i dint know bash was so sensitive. lol
 I have ubuntu lucid lynx installed. yesterday i switched off and on some plugins in compiz, and now sometimes when i maximize certain windows, i get logged off randomly, and am sent to the login screen. I tried switching off all the plugins in compiz and still the problem persists. what should i do?
 Laggg: try sudo pkill unity
 buhman: :)
 Laggg: what did it say?
 thien: put a func in your .bashrc
 thien: sorry, that wont work. i dint realise you wanted to do so automatically, presumably at startup. try http://embraceubuntu.com/2005/09/07/adding-a-startup-script-to-be-run-at-bootup/
 pici: oh cool. dint know that
 im reading this book "beginning linux programming" and it mentions the use  of the "dot" command. which makes commands in the shell execute directly in the shell process, and not in a sub process. i tried using it and i keep getting a "cannot execute binary fil" response. i tried doing ". ps" and ". /bin/ps" what am i missing?
 leojay: try shortcuts in preferences
 ActionParsnip:  no. thats not what i am trying to do. i know what you saying. but i think you misread my question
 mufasis: try typing raid and see what it says
 rob_p: would that make it run in the same process as the shell itself, rather than a sub process?
 rob_p: and i thought i would work on the commands too. is it that it only works on scripts? like ". ./script"
 rob_p: ok. i know this might be a stupid question to ask. but why not
 rob_p: lol. clearly i need to read more and figure out what sourcing is. but thanks.
 rob_p: aah! ok. now it makes sense.
 rob_p: so its like sharing the environment.
 rob_p: thus sharing scope. Am I right?
 rob_p: got it. thanks for clearing that up.
