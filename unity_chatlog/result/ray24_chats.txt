 hi, how do you auto-authenticate wireless keyring?
 Hi, how do you give yourself permission to delete/create in a secondary hard drive?
 I'm unable to delete/modify content in my secondary hard drive, I believe it has something to do with mount permission
 If someone can help me access my hard drive, it would be great
 well, my secondary hard drive won't allow me access to delete or create files on it
 When I try to unmount it, it saids "Failed to eject media; one or more volumes on the media are busy."
 ubunub, my abilities?
 ubunub, it doesn't make sense that I'd get that prompt, since I'm not running any application from that hd
 The goal here isn't unmounting, I want permission to delete my files, I believe I made an error yesterday when I deleted bundles of files from it
 Cmon where's ubunub I have lots of faith in you
 YYeah ubuntulo1
 I mean ubunub
 ubunub and I'm pretty sure that it's not an hd issue because I could delete files when plugged into another computer.
 ubunub, thanks dude.
 DaGeek247, I thought so too, however, it did not work
 DaGeek247, would you recommend that I do a reformat to evade this problem?
 DaGeek247, Thanks for taking your time responding, I will take the necessary action.
 I just reformatted my ubuntu and  still cannot access files on my secondary hd
 Can you download without entering password?
 If an external hd was originally formated on a windows, it should be able to on linux?
 For some reason, linux isn't letting me format my external drive
 "error creating filesystem"
 geus, I right click on the hd to format, just straight off linux
 wait, I just realized I had "ext" as type of format
 Nope, still didn't work. I changed it to NTSF type
 it's mounted
 I can access the files on it,but I can't delete or create new files on it, which is why I'm formating
 geus, it seems that I Don't have permission to access/delete my files on external
 geus, its formating now, I'm not sure if it was because I downloaded gparted as I did not use it.
 geus you're great, thanks.
 geus, it works now :) thanks again dude!!
