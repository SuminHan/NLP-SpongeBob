 Hello all
 I've been given a VPS with almost no information about it and told "migrate to this." As a first step, I did 'apt-get update && apt-get upgrade' and it tried to install grub. I told it not to. What are the chances that I screwed things up?
 Should a VPS install grup? I did apt-get upgrade and it tried to install grub
 I didn't think grub was installed before.
 *grub
