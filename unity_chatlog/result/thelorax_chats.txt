 is anyone having problems with their topbar in 11.04?
 anyone able to help?
 celtthunder: i just upgraded from 10.04 to 11.04 and my topbar isnt visable
 is there anyway to switch back to 10.04 from 11.04? i dont think 11.04 loaded properly
 how to i do that from terminal? will it erase my photos and mp3s? or will it be fine like when i upgraded?
 bazhang: im new to all this..can you explain?
 bazhang: my notebook hasnt a cd drive
 bazhang: i dont know what that means...when installed 10.04 about 6mo. ago i just downloaded it to my hardrive and it installed alongside windows 7
 bazhang:then a few days ago i upgraded to 11.04 thru my update manager or whatever..
 bazhang: yeah wubi
 bazhang: now i cant see my menu bar on the top of my desktop
 bazhang: so how would i go about accessing my applications and such?
 bazhang: you know? on the top of the screen? the menubar with applications and system and administration and all that?
 ZykoticK9: oh menu bar is really called "panel"?
 ubottu: that will make my menubar..or "panel" show back up?
 can anyone tell me how to reset my "panel" in terminal?
 i cant see my applications menu or anything
 thelorax@ubuntu:~$ gconftool--recursive-unset/apps/panel&&killall gnome-panel
 bash: gconftool--recursive-unset/apps/panel: No such file or directory
 thelorax@ubuntu:~$

 eiriksvin:are you having problems seeing your topbar?
 rage:can you see your top menu bar?
 rage: im new to all this..i just upgraded from 10.0 or whatever..and now i cant see my menu bar at the top where i chose my applications and such
 ZykoticK9: yeah i just upgraded from 10.0 or whatever
 ZykoticK9: and now i cant see my menu bar on the top of the screen that used to be there in 10.0 so i could choose from my applications or go to my software center or change my backround and themes and all that
 ZykoticK9: FUK! haha...i just want my old ubuntu back..how can i go about getting my menubar to show..or how do i use my applications..i can only see my desktop icons and my "dockY" at the bottom..so the only applications i have access to are the ones saved in my docky
 what do you use now?
 i dont want to go back to windows
 ZykoticK9:how do i switch without altering my files on ubuntu? is that possible?
 ZykoticK9: GMD screen?

 ZykoticK9: classic mode homie
