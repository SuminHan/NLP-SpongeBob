 DJKorbit: Are you a masochist perhaps?
 usalabs: nice question
 Hello.
 this release is quite buggy
 hi, again
 I'm having problem with the nvidia binary drivers: http://pastebin.com/6204GA6J
 [TK]D-Fender: did you select ubuntu instead of ubuntu-classic at the login?
 saimanoj: opera?
 nvidia-current has a broken dependency I don't know where to find: any hints?
 LjL: hi there
 LjL: do you happen to be a happy nvidia user?
 LjL: I meant "happy" as in "working with the binary driver after the upgrade to natty".
 AceKing: I don't recommend that. 11.04 has more bugs than a pack of stray St. Bernard.
 AceKing: indeed I am
 AceKing: I'd wait a couple of months if I were you.
 hello
 I had to install the nvidia binary driver from a PPA (v 270) because nvidia-current was lamenting a missing dependency. The new driver sucks though. Is there a way to install the stock one?
 has anyone encountered problems with nvidia-current requiring xorg-video-abi-9 ?
 Anyone using nvidia binary driver on natty?
 Incarus6: is it shown in the hardware drivers tool?
 Incarus6: did you upgrade from maverick or was yours a fresh install?
 Incarus6: I see...
 Incarus6: no, I had to install it by hand but then compiz effects aren't available
 Incarus6: thanks
 Incarus6: is it i386 or amd64 you're using?
 zak_: smb is your friend
 hello
 to whom should I report a probable installer bug?
 Dr_Willis: I'm not sure about the package, it's something in the installation procedure that doesn't work properly.
 natty is so much fail
 marcelC: why are you using backports in the first place?
 it sounds like a recipe for trouble
 marcelC: I would disable those repositories during the upgrade process
 bye
 hello
 volume applet has disappeared: how do I put it back in the system tray?
 ActionParsnip: it shows no icon
 bbl
 hello
 what is it doing unity-window-decorator running in my ubuntu-classic session?
 W43372: you poor man
 W43372: because you upgraded to natty. I've been fighting the urge to toss my computer out of the window since I did that.
