 bazhang, handbrake?
 ok I'll check it out right now.
 hmm.. installed Handbrake-cli and it's not even in my applications menu. even tried opening it via terminal.. claims it doesn't exist.
 uhm.. how do I open the HandBrakeCLI UI?
 --help doesn't give me much info.
 oh lawd.
 ya i need an interface... I tried using mencoder.. I can't access my external hard drive because it's named, "My Book" (with a space)
 and I cannot rename my external HDD
 ok bazhang
 really? ok.. let me check. so i would type My\ Book?
 ok ^^
 ok one last question.. the video is 720p HD quality... should the bitrate still stay @ 1200?
 ok
 hm... interesting.. I'll test both 1200 and 1500 :)
 thank you guys for assisting me.. that was fast and helpful :D
 uhm...
 what exactly is up with 11.04?
 just updated.. I can't even get Ubuntu to boot up unless I use, "previous" which.. still uses 11.04 <_< lol
 also.. I can't right click my panel to remove it... 11.04 for some reason put an additional upper panel on my right screen.. and also put the app panel on the right screen and I can't move it.
 mine does the same logi.. i have to use previous installation
 then it loads up <_<;
 ick...
 hmm... this new update threw my compiz/emerald off too
 Anyone know if the new update has thrown compiz into a whacky mode?
 i'm gonna take a screen shot of what's going on with my desktop.. It's like deteriorating
 Can someone tell me why I have the white upper border on my desktop.. going across both my screens as well as that start menu panel on the right side?... I'd like to remove the panel on the left screen. then just slide the right panel to the left screen: http://tinypic.com/r/rkc1ef/7
 huh? how gmachine_24 my start menu is missing images if that makes any sense
 start menu buttons*
 boo..
 and i thought right clicking on the desktop.. gave you the option to, "refresh" your desktop?
 Omega... it seems to handle Flash better than Firefox.
 but it doesn't support html short cuts like CTRL+B = Bold code :(
 anyone know how I can remove my upper panels? It's flaking out on me.
 Ok.. gonna restart my PC... this buggy panel is annoying.
 Hey guys... after the update from 10.10 to 11.04.. my dual monitors are not being recognized correctly. They're seen as one large screen... how do I get it to detect correctly outside of the display settings manager?
 same here InHisName... I hit ALT+CTRL+DEL and it reboots instantly.. then I choose, "previous version" and it loads 11.04 anyways o.O;
 ew ><;
 man it's weird being borderless lol.. I gotta get used to this.
 lol sheldon im in the same situation with that as well
 i have dual monitors... but the right monitor is acting as the main.. and my display manager is claiming i have 1 large screen instead of two <_<
 I wonder if my 11.04 is hanging due to video card drivers..
 anyone have a full english version of this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1719218
 I can't understand what I need to do to fix my login issue.
 celthunder... it seems to be a common one... simply, at the splash screen (where it shows an image of ubuntu + loading bar) it just stays there.. then I hit ALT+CTRL+DEL and it reboots instantly. From there, I choose, "previous version" and it loads quickly... and looks like 11.04 is loading
 that's all?
 or you need me to paste bin it or something?
 alright.. ill reboot in a minute then.
 do I need to log in via recovery, celthunder?
 ok celthunder.. gimme one minute brb
 CTRL+ALT+F1 fails, celthunder.
 I select, "2.6.38-8-generic", then it loads up the latest splash screen (black, blue, gray with blue loading bar), and it just hangs until I hit  CTRL+ALT+DEl
 O.o;
 not sure what you mean celthunder... choosing between init 1 and 3
 ok celthunder.. will try right now
 bleh init 1 and 3 both fail to boot =\
 anyone have a how to on fixing the broken upgrade of 11.04? I can log using previous version 2.6.35-28 but fails on 2.6.38-8. Using previous version seems to be loading up 11.04 though since it's using Unity GUI
 lol 11.04 came out waaaay too early. This GUI is broken in so many ways it's not even funny.
 anyone notice that Unity conflicts with Compiz?
