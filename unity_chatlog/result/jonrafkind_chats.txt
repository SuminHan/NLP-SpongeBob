 i accidentally removed the 'logout/shutdown' button from my gnome-panel, how do I get it back?
 i have the indicator applet already
 ChogyDan, oh sorry you wre right, session is different from just the regular applet
 its confusing because there are like 4 indiciator applet things :p
 ill go with the shutdown applet, thanks Juest !
 rofl
 kippers, install wicd. network manager is garbage
 sudo apt-get install wicd
 and then you can uninstall network manager: sudo apt-get remove network-manager
 because having both installed at the same time will break stuff
 is anyone else suffering from 'gain calibratino timeout' errors due to bad interactions between powernow-k8 and ath5k?
 compengi, cp -a
 i dont think so
