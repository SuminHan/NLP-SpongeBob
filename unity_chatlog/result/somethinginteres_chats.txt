 DexterLB: rundown of what you've tried?
 Roasted_: wouldn't it display on the display set as primary?
 Roasted_: perhaps you should lodge a bug report.. seems like that'd affect many people
 Roasted_: there's a new version of unity out that hasn't landed, that changes a number of things e.g. "Home Folder" to "File Manager". Maybe it is fixed in there
 Roasted_: I had hoped it would be out by now, I am sure it will come in regular updates at -some- time. Not sure when
 Roasted_: the latest version that's landed in user updates is 3.8.10 but 3.8.12 is up on Launchpad. Hopefully it'll be available soon
 John_Gate: Usually natty should tell you about extra drivers. Try running "additional drivers" yourself
 John_Gate: use the dash to search for "additional drivers" and run that and see how it goes
 [diablo]: try uninstalling the package "overlay-scrollbars"
 [diablo]: sorry "overlay-scrollbar"
 John_Gate: it would appear you're out of luck, try joining the channel #ati to ask for help
 mang0: what do you mean by "won't install"?
 burg: Right click on network manager click "edit connections"
 burg: should be able to set it up from there
 Hedgehog456: not sure, here in AU the package information doesn't seem to be updating
