 If I upgrade ubuntu, will I be able to keep my settings and applications?
 PythonPup: I also have a laptop and had to manually compile wifi drivers and I also installed burg. Do you think that'll remain too, if i upgrade?
 Oh..and printer drivers
 PythonPup: thanks

 ppk_: do you use 64 bit?
 ppk_: maybe try getting the 64 bit version of flash. youtube has some tutorials
 ppk_: I like using xbmc. great media center. great software. you should try it.
 why isn't that new kernel in 11.04 available in 10.10?
 So when upgrades are available through update manager they are just minor and not as big as the one available in 11.04 right?

 bullard4: are you tying to throw me off? lol
 Is there an amd card that is fully compatible with linux? Or am I better off getting Nvidia?
 I heard people say that they have their radeon cards running fine in linux. Is it recommended to get ATI?
 Simkin: Ahh. So I guess my future plans are to mix a phenom II with Nvidia. Is this a good mix? I mean, is it likely that I will run into some issues?
 For a new rig.
 :)
 Simkin: What kind of video card are ya using?
 Simkin: Btw, have you ever tried Dolphin Emu on your setup?
