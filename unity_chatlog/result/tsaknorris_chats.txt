 ^Phantom2^: tell me exactly the commandline parameters how you launch it?
 ^Phantom2^: and does minecraft run on openJDK? or do you need "real" java :D
 ^Phantom2^:  show me the commandline parameters
 ^Phantom2^: you should!!!! "java -Xmx1024M -Xms512M -cp Minecraft.jar net.minecraft.LauncherFrame" <--- make launcher of that
 ^Phantom2^: and USE SUN JAVA :D
 ^Phantom2^: dont use openJDK
 ^Phantom2^: well do what i say and it will run all year ^^.
 ^Phantom2^: first install SUN JAVA and then make launcher out of that commandline parameters

 ^Phantom^: so you didnt got that SUN JAVA even minecraft needs it
 ^Phantom^: sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
 ^Phantom^: replace jre also with jdk
 ^Phantom^: and you cannot maybe use both javas..open and sun...you have to remove openjdk....
 ^Phantom^: you can use synaptic package manager its easier....
 ^Phantom^: yes
 im off now..bye all :)
