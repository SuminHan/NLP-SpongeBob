 natty came out today?
 why would you want to roll back?
 so im not going to upgrade then
 if people are having problems with 11.04
 ive never heard of ubuntu having this much problems with new releases
 they will fix it within a couple of weeks
 I would imagine
 arent they changing the gui too?
 I wouldnt upgrade I'd do a fresh install
