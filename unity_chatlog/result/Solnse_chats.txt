 Since I upgraded to 11, ubuntu won't load... it gets stuck on checking battery state... is this something I can fix?
 I was hoping somebody could point me in the right direction.... since upgrading to 11, ubuntu hangs on checking battery state. I can't seem to find anything through searches. Is there something I can do to fix this problem?
 rach0, exactly
 rach0: during boot is just starts to hang and does nothing, the last thing I see on the list is checking battery state
 rach0: ok, and that's all I should do, then reboot and it should boot?
 rach0: thank you very much for your response, I will go try it now.
 Since I upgraded to 11, ubuntu hangs while booting.... the last thing I see is "checking battery state..." I think the problem is related to my graphics driver because I am able to boot into failsafe, low graphics mode. How can I upgrade my graphics driver to see if it fixes the problem?

 lcb: I'm sorry I don't understand... where do I find the catalyst control?
 lcb: I get an initialization error when trying to open the Catalyst Control Center: No ATI graphics driver is installed, or the ATI driver is not functioning properly
 lcb: do you know of a walk-through page for that?
 lcb: no proprietary drivers are in use on this system
 lcb: however I can choose to activate ATI/AMD proprietary FGLRX graphics driver on this window
 lcb: it's downloading and installing. thank you... so when I reboot all should be good?
 lcb: ok.
 lcb: rebooting to try. thanks again.
 lcb: thank you very much, now in Ubuntu 11 for the first time. will have fun learning the new GUI
 just set up your server info in dreamweaver  the same you set up godaddy info
 brandon, you are simply trying to access a different web server, your own, instead of godaddy right? On your windows box... you simply set up the info in dreamweaver for the ftp the same you did for godaddy.
