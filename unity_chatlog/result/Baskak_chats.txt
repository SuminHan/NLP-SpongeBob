 hi, i have a failure following upgrade to 11.04. after the upgrade was on its way for some time, i have found the system in the following state: https://picasaweb.google.com/108748234852103512253/U1104upgradefailure#, and nearly frozen. no other option than "skinny elephants" seemed to work. now it doesn't start, halts on something called "plymouth", also in recovery mode. ps. fresh install...
 ...is really not a possibility to me.

 sorry
 wolfreak, i can start the system at all, booting stops at "plymouth"
 *can't
 yes, no diff
 it doesn't reach the recovery mode menu
 blackbit: ubuntu (...) 2.6.38-8-generic rescue mode (at least that's how it probably sounds in english)
 blackbit: trying again now
 wolfreak: it was an upgrade, not a fresh install
 wolfreak: during my linux history i did some 20 fresh installs, and i am totally fed up
 blackbit: sorry, it doesn't seem an option for a workstation... maybe for testing alphas and betas. i need to repair. update: now the system loops on "failed to enumerate usb device..."
 wolfreak: thanks, you think no appropriate expert here?
 or try again here another time?
 wolfreak: ps. this address http://reddit.com/u/ubuntu is wrong...
 wolfreak: i see :)
 thx
 thanks for advice and concern anyway :)
