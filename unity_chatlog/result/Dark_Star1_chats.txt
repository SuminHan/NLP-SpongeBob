 Hi. is there anyone here that uses virtualbox in ubuntu and has managed to configure the networking for the guest OS?? I can't get anything from loopback ping
 does anyone know how to change the ldap root password please?
 hello.. I'm having a problem starting Samba and I need help getting to the root of it.. the output of smbstatus  is: No Locked Files whilst looking at the samba.log.smbd file shows me: [2011/05/03 19:49:22.033587,  0] smbd/server.c:1255(main)  ERROR: failed to setup guest info.
 DOn't upgrade a virtualised ubuntu.. Mine just died :)
 Well don't upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04
 h4x0rs: It's not a virtualised ubuntu is it?
 h4x0rs: I'm in the middle of something myself.. Give me a few mins and I'll get back to you
 hello has anyone managed to implement bridged networking in ubuntu with a vbox guest os?? I need to be able to contact the guest os from the network
 has anyone manage to configure bridge networking with a virtualbox guest OS in 10.10?? I need a decent guide or ssome tips please
 compdoc: can you give me a guide? or pointers?
 usr13: thanks for the help... I already looked and the ubuntu help only covers from 2.1
 compdoc: 2
 compdoc: I need the guest os to appear on the network
 compdoc: so I want to assign eth2 to the guest OS
 compdoc: just need pointers to a decent guide 's all.. Ok but my interfaces file is quite simple so far
 compdoc: http://fpaste.org/FEuS/
 compdoc: yeah
 compdoc: it's a standard 10.10 install
 compdoc: yup auto eth2
 compdoc: doone
 compdoc: No eth0 is commented out.. I have 2 cards the one I'm using right now has a manual address set
 compdoc: it's named eth0-eth2 as shown in the network interfaces file
 usr13: no thnaks.. I need to manually configure this but i've not bridged before  let alone with a virtualised guest
 compdoc: Yeah. I want all network traffic on eth2 to go to vboxnet0
 Dr_Willis: I tried that (choosing the bridge network settings) but it turned out it wans't that simple... I need the guest os to repsond to a manually assigned ip address
 compdoc: Yeah I'll be manually assigning an address to the guest
 compdoc: and less headachy but I just need to have the guest OS on it's own permanent address
 compdoc: don't think so. I'll check
 compdoc: yes it's now installed
 compdoc: just doing that now.. Will let you know
 compdoc: I madethe changes but before I restarted the network daemon I just pinged the Virtual guest and I get a response.
 compdoc: I don't know how but I'll take it.. :D
 compdoc: Well I think so.. I can ping it from my laptop so yeah
 kubu2: because it opens up a root like finder windoww
 kubu2: agreed...
