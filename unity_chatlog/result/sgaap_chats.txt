 Coty91, you could try the opensource ati drivers instead of fglrx
 Coty91, used a deb or ati's own installer?.
 Coty91: then you can use the uninstall probably, and just remove/rename your x conf
 its not as bad as people make it, but i prefer gnome 3 on 11.04 over unity
 Coty91: games
 btw, is 11.4 (from ati) included in 11.04?
 Bisa: do you see a bootloader before that?
 Bisa, you can use a live cd to reinstall grub, or do it via the bios with efi
 if you have edi that is
 Bisa: it should be
 Bisa, depends on which version of grub you have
 Bisa, with 1 its just: 1. root (hx.x), where x.x is your disk and partition, 2 setup (hd0) and then quit (this is from the grub shell, just type grub on the cli)
 Bisa: assuming your bootdisk is the first one
 Bisa: remember, disk 1, partition 1 is hd (0,0) in grub 1
 Bisa, if you have booted into a livecd you can use the grub command to get into the grub command line
 \
 Bisa: there you can set your linux root and install it with setup (hd0) into your mbt
 Bisa: if everything went ok you should see grub after a boot now
 Bisa, if they value for root is wrong, you can change it by changing the entries
 Bisa: with "e" from grub
 Bisa, you need to set the root of you linux partition with root (hd2,partition) then and install it with setup (hd0), this is assuming you boot from your first disk
 Bisa, if linux is on your first partition of your 3th disk that would be hd(2,0)
 Bisa, you need to do the setup (hdX) to whatever disk your bios boots from
 Bisa, im not sure if those insctructions are valid for grub 2, havent got any hands-on experience with that
 Bisa, if its grub 2 best to check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
 kaiuwe: you run it with sudo?
 Bisa, np, but i still advice checking the howto for grub 2 if its that, there is also a gui for ubuntu to configure grub2
 Bisa, which you should be able to use from a live cd of 11.04
 Bisa, let me check
 Bisa: sudo apt-get install startupmanager
 Bisa; havent tested it myself so im not sure what it can do
 Bisa, you should run it with sudo at least
 ejv: i dont think so, still in the lastest kernel release
 Brisa: gl
 darkz: if your connection is ok maybe flush the dns cache?
 darkz, ok, i assumed you had a connection because the other updates went fine
 good to hear
 Brisa: yw
 if you dont want to use unity its safe to install the gnome 3 ppa
 or check out cairo dock
 html_inprogress: if the source file is in odf (as xlsx) then probably it can
 html_inprogress: if you use odf on both side (libreoffice and ms office) then it should work
 html_inprogress: then it depends if you use macro's/vb
 Kevin: it means that the proposed res and or hz is bigger then what your monitor is capable of, did you upgrade?
 Kevin: just rename you /etc/X11/xorg.conf and see if the autodetect works, maybe your old drivers arent working
 McQueen, if you pick ubuntu classic desktop at gdm login does that happen too?
 Jasonn try something like midori if you want minimal
 McQueen, if you are at the login screen (assuming you dont login automatically) you can choose a session, pick ubuntu classic and then login
 Jasonn: if you have fans spinning you have overheating and load might not even be the primairy issue
 McQueen: the reason for testing with ubuntu classic is to see if it also happens then
 Jasonn, it might be something hogging cpu or gpu, it might be dust or bad airflow for example.
 Jasonn, if thats the case and no visible load issues are around its important to determine whats making the noise, some gpu drivers for example can cause your gpu to become hot
 Jasonn: your videocard
 Jasonn, well, if its the one making the noise then its ovious it runs too hot
 Jasonn: and if its not then its something else
 Jasonn, with lm-sensors you might be able to get temp readings if all your temp monitors are found
 Jasonn, just "sudo apt-get install lm-sensors" and run "sensors" in a terminal
 Jasonn: then its probably not reconizing your hardware monitors
 Jasonn, do you have any other os, if so does it happen to run hot too?
 Jasonn, if you do top in a terminal is one of the loads above 1?
 Jason, its rather high, or you system is very old
 Jason, and does top show apps with high cpu and/or mem?
 Jasonn, for example, mine is taking around a few % cpu max, with spikes depending on activity
 Jasonn: for xorg
 Jasonn: then it might be your driver
 Jasonn: whats your graphics card?
 Jasonn, what zykotick9 just said
 Jasonn: thats the only one in the list?
 Jasonn, im not sure then, it might just be an issue with that driver
 Jasonn: does the graphics card has a fan? its an integrated gpu so it might be fanless
 well, then it can hardly be the source of the noise, so it must be something else :s
 Jasonn: can you make up which fans make more noise, casefan, or cpu
 Jasonn: you got 3 fans minimum: psu (power), cpu and case
 Jasonn, yes, or blowing it out
 Jasonn: you can have more then one
 Jasonn, then it might be set like that in the bios, just responding on extra heat
 Jasonn, still, they accumulate dust faster then vacuumcleaners
 Jasonn, i use compressed air from time to time to clean mine our
 if its not load or so then i cant think of any other reason
 foreverthenuni: tried sudo apt-get -f install?
 forevertheuni: so its only a black background in unity?
 forevertheuni: what kind of?
 smp4488: very likely yes
 smp, afaik you should be able to start and x session with only a browser
 foreverthenuni: and if you enable compositing in kde (extra effects or whatever they are called)
 forevertheuni, but are your extra window manager compositing features enabled in kde, it could just as well be that its glx/opengl stuff that goes wrong
 forevertheuni, it doesnt no
 forevertheuni, so you get a black screen in the unity fallback mode?
 forevertheuni, what do you mean by that?
 cache: i think those are the options from gdm, it seems all fail but kde
 fail being a black screen
 Kevin, the only thing that might be an issue is if the driver overclocked your gpu and it fried, but that would be a long shot
