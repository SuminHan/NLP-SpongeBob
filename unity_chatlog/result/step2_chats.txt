 maximus_, the menu option doesn't work?
 maximus_, there prob is one (but not sure if without su) but I don't know it, maybe google will help :)
 SoftTimur, you mean with unity?
 SoftTimur, the new default desktop with one panel on top and one on the left
 SoftTimur, I got that but I need to know what you are using. if you are in unity you can't move it
 SoftTimur, I told you ... it's a desktop environment that is new with one panel at the left (that autohides) and one on the top. there is still the option to choose the old environment on login
 !unity
 schneidmaster, you can remove the other one. making a custom one prob. easier than modifying
 SoftTimur, choose 'logout' (top right menu i think) then at the login screen there is a bar at the bottom where you can choose
 Vhozard, depends which ones ... 'dmesg' for one
