 HRT, could you be more specific?
 HRT, i suggest you remove the fgrlx stuff and go with the open source. i think the binaries are still quite buggy with natty. also there is no problems with the effects using the open source one. i'm with a HD 5500
 ThomasUK, no it doesn't it just has bugs as expected, mainly with Unity

 stREaKer, i mean the default driver that comes with the installation, no fglrx stuff
 stREaKer, can you explain what's the problem with booting in Natty
 stREaKer, do you have the fglrx driver installed?
 stREaKer, alright boot in recovery and sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev* xorg-driver-fglrx
 stREaKer, then restart X
 stREaKer, can you get to terminal?
 stREaKer, go into terminal and type in sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86

 erkan^,  google for gnome3 ppa for natty
 erkan^,  i should say use it at your own risk
 tmaster, no there should not be any serious problems with drivers. I suspect everything will work out of the box
 tmaster, i have a HD 5500 and it works fine, just dont install the binary drivers
 tmaster, no just don't get them after installation unless you really need them (and i don't suspect you will)
 Solnse, do you get the "Checking battery state" msg
 Solnse, get into recovery terminal and try sudo apt-get install -reinstall gnome-power-manager
 it should although it may throw out another error but at least you get back to GUI
 Solnse, you're welcome, if something goes wrong feel free to ask
 Crazy, open a chrome tab and type about:plugins. See if the flash plugin is located and loaded
 Crazy, sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree and then "sudo cp /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/chromium-browser/plugins/
 Crazy, then restart Chromium
 Crazy, does it loads other plugins?
 Crazy, open a terminal and type -> chromium-browser --enable-plugins
 Crazy, yes it does, now in the new window can you run flash videos?
