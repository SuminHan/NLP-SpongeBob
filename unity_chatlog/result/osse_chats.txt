 mikebot, what do you mean by "on the same partition"? Did you install it from within Windows?
 mikebot, if they are visible from 'Computer' you probably have the side-pane in the File manager turned off :P Try pressing F9
 mikebot, if you go to System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Visual effects you can choose 'None'. That should help
 mikebot, then probably you don't have any desktop effects at all, because somehow it's not supported. Do you know what graphics card you have?
 mikebot, did you find the Visual Effects tab,?
 Soothsayer, I don't know why you don't have that tab.
 mikebot, then I don't know. Sorry. Maybe it will help if you install Ubuntu not from within Windows, but that can be a bit complicated if you're not experienced with creating partitions and so on
 mikebot, if you use a so-called extended partition instead of a primary partion you can have as many partitions as you like. The extended partitions works as a "frame" you but logical partitions. But still it means you have to remove one of the partitions you have now.
 I just booted up with a USB stick with the 64-bit Natty images. Have they moved the "try or install directly" choice to the GRUB menu or is there something wrong with my imagethingy??

 bahamas, how have you modified it? Which OS is the other one?
 bahamas, I would suggest installing a new menu.lst. Grub has gotten pretty good at detect stuff lately.
 bahamas, hold on. which versions are you upgrading from and to?
 bahamas, is it too late? :P If I'm not mistaken 9.04 used grub, not grub2.
 bahamas, I would still install a new one though, but make a backup of the original
 bahamas, it'll probably be fine. It's been a long time since I've had to modify the grub menu manually
 bahamas, but I apologize in advance if it turns out I've given som incredibly stupid advice.
 bahamas, I would wait. In reality I don't think you have a choice since the package manager thingy is in use by the upgrade process.
 bahamas, I think I gotten the question about menu.lst before without me even changing the file myself at all. If you can't remember how you modified it it probably wasn't important :P Stuff like which is where on the menu and timeout and all that is easy to change. Are you going through a chain of upgrades or are you stopping at 9.10 ?
 ohsix, true! but in this case I think we are stuck with grub, not grub2 which is what made it all better, I believe.
 bahamas, I'm not really sure. I can't think of anything that should make it slower except for fancier desktop effects which you can turn off.
 Each time a new Ubuntu version comes out I see a lot about upgrading. But I never manage to find out if there will be any significant difference between a fresh install and an upgraded installation. I guess because there are none?
 rgr: Maybe a "no news is good news" kind of thing :P
 Thanks, guys. I'll try to think of stuff I might have done. In 11.04 the default media player has changes. Does this mean that Banshee won't get installed because it notices that I have Rhythmbox set as the default player?
 Froq, extracted it'll be over 400 MB I think. Text files are usually very compressable. Also, that it's a bunch of small files instead of a few larger ones contributes.
 jrib, ohsix: thanks.
 Does anyone know how to make Ctrl+Shift act like AltGr?
