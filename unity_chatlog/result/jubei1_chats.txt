 hello, i am trying to setup a home server/gateway using linux server 10.04 and 2 NICS
 hello, i am trying to setup a home server/gateway using linux server 10.04 and 2 NICS, from the server i use eth1 to dial PPPoE to router and can ping out to internet from server. I use eth0 to switch to give access to client PC's. from the clients i can be assigned dhcp from server and can ping the server. however i cannot ping the internet, the server is blocking requests(?). i have setup
 packet-forwarding=1 and have put some rules into iptables, but i messed up the iptables rules... could someone inspect the iptables rules, this is 1st time im doing it, and let me know what they think?
 usr13: ok let me get on that
 Guest1496740: download the iso from the website, burn, and put it in the cdrom drive to install.
