 I have Ubuntu installed on an exteral HDD since 10.04 I've upgraded to 10.10 when it came out and ran the upgrade to 11.04 yesterday. It stopped listening to my wireless KB/mouse (logitech) near the end of the upgrade but rebooted itself. I then tried to boot into 11.04 and I press enter to boot the defualt Kernel it looks like it's booting but my external shuts off before it can (seemingly) do anything. I can'r see the bootsplas
 step21: USB2.0
 hihihi100: about 1hr 30mins but I used the alternative install CD to upgrade and ethernet
 hihihi100: no
 step21: I know it's Ubuntu shutting it off becuase the lights are on all through the boot untill I 4 seconds after I press the kernel then it goes a blank screen with a blinking cursor and my ext-HDD shutrs off
 hihihi100: no
 hihihi100: download the alternative CD iso burn it and put it in your running system
 hihihi100: run upgradefromcdrom that is on the CD if it doesn't start automatically
 Datz: use the alternative CD uppgrade
 step21: I turned self shutdown off. But what settings do you want me to check?
 step21: I know GRUB is using UUID to boot the drive or at least it was in 10.10
 step21: will do
 step21: yeah. Here's how I get to GRUB BTW: boot computer NTLDR>pick "Ubuntu Linux" and GRUB4DOS boots boot.img on the ext4 partition on my external HDD GRUB on Ubuntu appears and lets me pick what to do.
 step21: so look for what in my grub.conf?
 step21: ok so the root should be the ext4 partition on my external HDD. (which should be hd1,1 or if GRUB2 starts from 1 then hd2,2)
 step21: I'll log back into IRC from a Live CD and tell you what I find.
 who was just helping me?
 I think it was set21 but he isn't here anymore
 step21: yeah
 step21: ok everything checks out
 it does se root= and set=root tho
 set root=*
 thye both point to the right drive bu one does it using uuid (set=root) one does it like sdb,msdos2 (set root=)
 they*
