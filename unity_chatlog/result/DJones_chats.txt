 Rehan: No set time, just anytime in the next 15 hours
 Rehan: Its because they're limited to updates by the manufacturer and can't be modified by the community
 raju: You'll probably find that most linux magazines will have cover cd's with 11.04 on fairly soon
 thegoodcushion: Most likely, with it being a new release, the servers will be under heavy use
 DeathKnight: It has been
 Gawwad: You have to upgrade to 10.10 before you can upgrade to 11.04
 Gawwad: You can from LTS to LTS, but 11.04 is a normal release and not an LTS
 Gawwad: 6.06, 8.04, 10.04 were LTS, about every 2 years between LTS versions

 vibhav: There isn't a +1 version yet, so the channel is closed
 Xgates: I moved over to 64 bit about a month ago, I haven't noticed any issues with software not working
 tyler00: Not quite what you've asked about, but have you looked into the prey project http://preyproject.com/
 nicko: Do you just have one operating system on the machine or dual boot? If its a single o/s, it will normally just boot straight into ubuntu
 jwtiyar: As far as I know, you need the alternative cd/dvd to use a cd/dvd upgrade option
 jwtiyar: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NattyUpgrades About half way down it has details of upgrading using the alternate cd/dvd

 hyu: Please stopp spamming, its offtopic and not appropriate for this support channel
 slacker_nl: There isn't an ubuntu +1 in development yet, so the channel is closed
 slacker_nl: When new releases are made, they make the channel invite only so that people use #ubuntu for support to avoid confusion, once 11.10 starts being developed and available for download its normally opened up again
 novaria_fajar: You might be better asking that in #ubuntu-offtopic as its not strictly a support question, the offtopic channel is probably better for discussions like that

 donkeyinspace: Is the cd a desktop cd, or the minimal install cd? The minimal cd is a download of of only about 100Mb maybe that could be the cause
 donkeyinspace: ok, it was just a thought
