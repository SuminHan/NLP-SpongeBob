 Hi, in Natty is there a way to disable the auto-maximize of the browser upon open when in Unity?
 does anyone know how to add a new widget to the unity top toolbar?
 in 10.10 I used to have a performance monitor widget in the top panel that showed memory/cpu usage as well as temperatures
 it disapeared on upgrade to natty with unity
 thanks McShane , I found that just now
