 ...waiting for it to be in the repo's.
 because then all my other packages will be gone, including settings etc.. etc..
 Why isn't ubuntu 11.04 in the repo's yet?
 I have an issue, can anyone help? the laptop screen of my ubuntu 11.04 is blank, it's recognised, but it just won't do anything.
 an external screen works.
 When I look at the monitor settings, the screen is there, and when I change desktop it's there, but it doesn't display anything
 bakanub definately intel graphics.
 how do I do that, ActionParsnip?
 an Intel video chip, ActionParnsip
 ...still have no clue what to do with my blank screen...
 how come my intel laptop screen is just turned off? and how do I turn it on?
 the scree is just turned of, like Ubuntu thinks it's closed or someting, it's just recognised, but switched of. Avasz
 and how do I do that, misse-?
 Avasz laptop
 what u mean, sleep? It's working now, I'm actually chatting to you on my laptop using an external screen Avasz.
 yeah, and that one works, Avasz, but the laptop screen itself is blank (but recognised, and configured in "monitors" settings) disconnecting my external doesn't help.
 Avasz, it is in dual screen mode, my laptop actually tinks it's on, it just isn't.
 Avasz that doesn't do anything besides freezing the one I have...
