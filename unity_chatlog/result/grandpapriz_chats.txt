 Good morning, I just upgraded Ubuntu 10 to 10.04 and now can not boot.  I get an error message "out of range", can it be fixed?
 I  am on a laptop now, my problem is on the desktop, and thanks for the comeback
 all was well untill I upgraded.....I dual boot the desck top
 I do have nvidia drivers :-(
 I would hate to have to re-install both Debian and Ubuntu..any help ideas?
 I guess I will try the Debien forums
 thanks anyway
