 yo
 so, with the new 11.04. how the hell do i go about removing what i guess to be the empathy indicator and email indicator from the toolbar up top? i already removed the email software and empathy
 question: how do you edit what indicators show or remove indicators from the panel in the new ubuntu?
 can i edit the appmenu any? i dont like the empathy and evolution indicators being there.
 is it possible to resize a logical partition container with the free unallocated space being in front of it on the partition table?
 hihihi100, it took me about 2 hours
 i already know about partitioning for new installs and such
 and i know with primary partitions you cant resize if the unallocated space is at the front of the partition table. but i dont know about logical containers
 Sidewinder1, heh yeah. i still need to make a live o.s.. i was just wondering if it was possible to resize an entire container with the space in front of it before i go about trying to get everything ready
 Sidewinder1, thanks for the information
