 I'm looking forward to trying Unity more than ever now :-)
 I need to install Ubuntu over the network. Do these instructions look right? http://www.techienote.com/2010/06/pxe-booting-lucid-lynx-ubuntu-10-04.html
 Just switched to Unity - how do I configure the number and layout of workspaces?
 d-snake - bottom panel? I can't see one - only a left hand panel and a top panel.  Right clicking on the workspace switcher in the left hand panel does nothing.
 d-snake or anyone else - what do you see when you right click on the workspace switcher?  What's it called? If I know that maybe I can search fo rit
 selig5: I refuse to believe that the Unity team are that stupid
 d-snake - that's it! Thanks!
 d-snake: had got as far as looking through compiz config but didn't think to try "General Options".  Thanks agani!
 really should be configurable through right click - there's a bug for it http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/26889/
 d-snake: yeah, that's what I was used to.
 d-snake: I take it the move to Unity this early is to get a lot of developer eyes on it then?
 Am not too unhappy yet, will stick with it for a bit longer
 miked: yes
 just select "Ubuntu Classic" from the menu at the bottom before you log in
