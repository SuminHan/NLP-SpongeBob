 hi, can anyone point me where to find help adding postgresql support to my LAMP setup?
 cdoktor19, be warned though. i think flash isn't that great with 64 flavor yet
 celthunder, i stand corrected
 tripelb, loved that movie. good thing you saved it
 cdoktor19, that's a bit involved. probably best if you stick with 32 bit first, IMHO.
