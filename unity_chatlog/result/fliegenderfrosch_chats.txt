 tripelb: if you want to do it in a graphical way, just press alt+f2 and enter "gksudo nautilus", then you should have a file manager with admin privileges
 pythoned: i usually use "ultimate boot cd" for this
 RRU_Sciguy: reformatting does leave traces
 pythoned: dd deletes the data securely, if you want to be totally sure use it multiple times, but after one run it should be really hard to get data even for forensics
 pythoned: for added fun, use if=/dev/random :)
 pythoned: if you overwrite the data several times with random data, it should be impossible even for specialists to get data, if i recall correctly, i have read an article that even overwriting once  should be enough
 pythoned: if you use a tool like "boot and nuke" from the ultimate boot cd, you can select different modes which correspond e.g. to security standards of the american department of defense
 Ahmuck: do you want to completely remove it or just use the traditional desktop? if itâ€™s the latter, just chose "traditional gnome desktop" at login
 kate__: try cd Downloads (without /)
