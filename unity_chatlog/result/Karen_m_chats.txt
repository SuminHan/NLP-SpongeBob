 what's the best flowcharting software for ubuntu?   Know how there is freemind, I was hoping there is something lightweight like it to do flowcharting.
 does upgrading to 11.04 break anything?
 caly, why is that?
 so skip 11.04 for now?
 Soothsayer, what?
 10.10 sucked for my laptop, it would not use my wireless properly!  I wonder if 11.04 will work :)
 with 11.04, how do you get into System->updates or System menu...
 i want to check my video drivers
 i actually like unity!
 UNITE
 zvacet, thanks for that..
 THE WIRELESS IN 11.04 ACTUALLY WORKS, yay ya ya ya yayayayayayaya\
 with my remote desktop, why does it show 2 hosts showing up when there is only 1 host?
 Hosts nearby .. will always show 2 hosts when there is only 1...  one works, one doesn't
 why?
 no it won't let me
