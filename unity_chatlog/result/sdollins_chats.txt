 Has anyone had issues with broadcom drivers after installing some recent updates?
 (using natty btw)
 Odd. It just completely screwed up earlier. I disabled them and after about 10 reboots it appears to be using the built in drivers without issue. BrunoPE.
 BrunoPE: Probably unrelated but after installing some recent updates, my screen stays dim no matter what now :/
 Okay uhhh I just noticed the battery/power thing in the indicator applets has disappeared :/
 I swear to $deity, I am going to scream. :( Everytime I reboot something else breaks lol..
 Well, wifi randomly decides to work, this time i have no borders around windows ( can't remember the technical name)
 Everything went to hell after I installed some updates earlier.
 Woo! It's all working now. - reboot.
 I was on maverick, I upgraded to natty a couple days ago it went to hell but started working right after a fight, and after some updates today it's even worse.
 Nope marenostrum
 I rebooted and wifi doesn't work lol
 It doesn't seem to matter if the proprietary broadcom drivers are enabled or not, it just randomly decides to work.
 My router works fine.
 I've already tested it.
 pennnn: KDE, Xfce, etc.
 pennnn: they're removing the classic desktop in 11.10
 gartral: I feel the same way. I don't like GNOME-Shell, Unity, KDE, or any other the others I've tried. At this point, I'm about ready to cough up cash for a macbook pro lol.
 marenostrum: any luck with that?
 I reboot over and over. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. ._.
 I really regret upgrading to natty :/
 my SO talked me into it really.
 pennnn: I imagine someone will provide a way to put gnome2 back.
 gartral: everything keeps breaking!
 I don't have time to do a clean install really but it looks like I have no other choice.
 How did a bug like being unable to rearrange the windows in the windows list applet not get fixed?
 It was reported in early January according to launchpad.
 Minor or not, i would consider it to be important functionality.
 The issue with the window list.
 I haven't found anything in relation to the wireless issue.
 It didn't start until updates I installed today and I had just updated like 1 day ago I suspect it's not out there.
 marenostrum: I can't remember if you said or not but is he using broadcom drivers?
 pennnn: you're doing the same thing so I wouldn't complain.
 marenostrum: It appears after I upgraded to natty it stopped using the broadcom drivers but they stayed enabled.
 Actually... I just noticed, my wired network isn't freaking working either.
 I think I'm about to cry lol..
 I think maybe telling him they were removing it 11.10 was a bad idea xd
 it in*
 I tried to use Xubuntu but missed some stuff :(
 Even Ambiance lol
 MethedMan: I imagine most modern mail program will allow you to use a proxy.
 You probably won't find many proxies that allow sending mail.
 pennnn: That's not really something you can recommend ._.
 I'm about ready to switch to Windows :(
 If something breaks then, I can just make Dell fix it :D!
 marenostrum: It seems I've /fixed/ it or it's just cooperating for more than 1 reboot.
 As for how? I have no idea but it is apparently working.
 I bet I'm annoying the piss out of people with pidgin signing in and out xd
 Starminn: I keep rebooting so it's signing in and out.
 I have you on my contact list? o:
 pennnn: then install kubuntu-desktop
 Then go download it and install it
 I can't tell if I just need to do a clean install or if the classic mode is buggy as hell.
 It's like everytime I login some applet is failing or the theme is all screwed up.
 I'm starting to really dislike Ubuntu. :(
 VanDyke: Good idea as I'm pretty sure 11.04's classic mode is buggy (possibly on purpose ._.)
 Everytime I reboot 1 of 2 things happens: Wifi doesn't work or applets fail like crazy
 what about it?
 Not using LTS has nothing to do with that.
 I don't think expecting a normal release to be stable is absurd.
 well marenostrum I was wrong. Wifi is still broken. I've given on up on fixing it. It's freaking 4:20 AM :/
 tic^: really not neded.
 needed*
 I'm actually not sure if I will install Ubuntu.
 You see, I absolutely hate Unity and find it to be horridly unproductive. I don't really want to have to install another desktop environment so switching is inevitable for me.
 At the moment, I'm about ready to switch to Windows.
 I'm not :(
 zvacet: I don't really like Gnome3 either.
 tuxx-: because that's just a temporary fix.
 Xfce is missing some stuff I want. KDE is well not for me.
 I'm happy with gnome2 :(
 Never even heard of it, is it new?
 Xfce is okay I guess.
 I installed xubuntu on an old laptop and i didn't find it horrible but it's missing stuff :(
 I work in IT and at the end of the day I don't want to fight with my computers :(
 DocPlatypus: I figure there will be "Gubuntu".
 Fedora 15 will be sporting GNOME3 so that's an option.
 Out of curiosity, was there any user input on whether Unity was wanted?
 I don't keep up with things. I just use what works and it's been Ubuntu [up until now].
 Well 10.10 worked fine :P
 I suppose I shall backup my data and reinstall 11.04.
 If that fails, I will rage and likely install Windows.
 Now... to find a freaking DVD.
