 Ubuntu has become really crappy you know?
 Man i miss the old distros
 ActionParsnip, you can't deny that its getting really crappy compared to the old ubuntu distros
 i will w8
 More and more people are having problems with the 3 latest ubuntu releases, and i am one of those. i have seen so many bugs in these last releases that i felt like i would jump out of the window xD
 I really prefere the old ones like i.ibex and seems like i will change distro again. i loved ubuntu and i still love it but it gets really crappy
 Right now i have problems with my usb drives

 ActionParsnip, You mean if i have reported a bug?
 ActionParsnip, nope
 ActionParsnip, Thats true, but why i haden't ha d these problems with other distros?
 Anyway, i'll change because i need a realtime kernel so ubuntu won't do for me anyway
 I will always love it as it was the distro that started my Linux Journey :)
 joakim, if you want to post outputs of a terminal etc it would be  a good idea to use pastebin.com
 Lcawte, You have to get a big external drive, this thing will save you many times and its a must
 ojii go to system/Administration/language  support
 ojii there is a small box which says Apply system wide, did you push that? xD
 ojii, damn...maybe its a bug then xD
 ojii thats cool xD
