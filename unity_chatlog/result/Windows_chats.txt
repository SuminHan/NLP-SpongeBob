 Is this the correct Ubuntu channel?
 Cool thanks! I'm slowing making the switch from Winblows to Ubuntu
 I've tried Mint and Open suse but always come back to Ubuntu. Guess I have a soft spot for it :P
 Ha ha sweet! I'm really liking 11.0.4 been using it since the beta
 Oh shit I just realized. My name is Windows. It suppose to be Windows Sucks wtf? lol
 My bad won't happen again
 I do have a problem though with XBMC. I run dual displays (26" lcd tv and 22" lcd monitor) I run XBMC on the TV which works great until I load up XBMC. XBMC doesn't seem to pick up my TV. Figured this was graphics card related and not XBMC. Any ideas?
