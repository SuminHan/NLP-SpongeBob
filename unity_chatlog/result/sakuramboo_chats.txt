 is there any way to separate the unity menu? in gnome 2.x, i had sub folders for my games and would like to keep them, instead of just having one giant list
 crlcan81: well, see, thats the problem, i have over 50 games, hense why i separated them by genre
 but, no way to do it with the unity menu? i actually like the unity menu and would like to utilize it
 crlcan81: same here, just started playing with it an hour ago, still reinstalling all packages that didnt make it in the upgrade
 crlcan81: well, some graphics and development packages i need and didnt make it, so yeah, theres a lot of packages that need to be reinstalled
 but, i had to do this with every version, so i wrote a script that handled adding the PPAs and installing all packages for me
 crlcan81: you can change the desktop wall with ccsm and i read on a blog somewhere about how to install deb files
 well, all in all, im liking it, of course there is a lot of things broken now because of the change and will take some getting used to, but i actually have high hopes for unity
 durando: dont have a window selected, move the mouse to the top bar, you will see a "places" button, check there
 durando: what happens when you select Network?
 durando: you also have the "File" button and "Connect to Server", select windows share, enter the into and connect
 not with upgrading, just managing now that its running ;)
 Mitsukaru: click on the icon and hold it until the icon "lifts up"
 in the launcher, if i open a program once, is there a way to click the icon a second time and have it open a new window?
 ive installed a few games, but they do not show up in the games menu in unity, is there a way to manually add them?

 also, every time i launch gnome-terminal, it tells me that byobu-launcher isnt installed, why is it looking for byobu and how do i get it to stop saying that?
 rgr: im launching `gnome-terminal` from a terminal, the terminal opens fine, but reports that error, i can still use it, though. and there are no references to byobu in both $HOME/.bashrc and /etc/bash.bashrc
 KNUBBIG: if i remember correctly, there is a terminal version of pidgin available
 KNUBBIG: i used it before, some time last year, it was actually pretty cool. very good use of the ncurses library
 yes, thats it
 no problem :) enjoy it, its very nice
 kippers: does wireless work if you use the terminal?
 kippers: open a terminal, does the card show up when you type `lspci`?
 KNUBBIG: glad you like it, it saved me a few times in the past when i couldnt forward X11 over ssh ;)
 kippers: is the device listed in `iwconfig`?
 kippers: can you use `iwconfig` to set up your wireless connection?
 KNUBBIG: look into using screen with it, you can ssh into the machine from anywhere, run `screen -raAd` and bring your irssi connection right up without skipping a beat
 KNUBBIG: yeah, i dedicated an old Dell laptop, slapped slackware on it and all it does is listen on port 22, i run screen and irssi on it
 KNUBBIG: thats how im on here right now, im ssh'ed into it from my main desktop, its great, never have to sign off :)
 kippers: check your pvts
 KNUBBIG: my pleasure :)

 KNUBBIG: check permissions? should be -rw-r--r--
 jerriy: `sudo passwd`
 gotcha
 okay, this is weird, ive been using unity for the past two days and then i just started my computer today and it told me that i dont have the right hardware to run unity, how can that be?
 escott: i have direct rendering
 escott: i found out the problem, i have a separate partition for /tmp, when i upgraded, ubuntu put /tmp on the / partition, last night, i added /tmp to /etc/fstab, but in doing so, it now couldnt load unity, i commented out the line, rebooted and now it works
 does anyone know if unity requires /tmp to be executable to run?
 okay, well, unfortunately, i dont have time right now to track down this bug, when i get some time, ill write up a blog post about it
 i just find it weird that /tmp has to be part of the / partition
 Steela: rm $HOME/.mozilla/firefox
