 :) so true :)
 I'm a bit impatient too, because tonight I have to install a Ubuntu on a friend's netbook to replace 9.10 and I really hope it will be 11.04 :)
 it'll be that one and upgraded as needed if the images won't come out untill then :)
 Version Control System
 Anyone can confirm that the basic 11.04 will be good for a Asus eeepc?
 amphibgiraffe, guest345345: thanks! :)
 If I use the update manager as "update-manager -d" I can upgrade to 11.04. Is this correct? Should I continue as it is the stable one?
 guest345345: what do you been by not yet? :)
 guest345345: I see now, it is still the beta as stated in it's note
 Another Asus eepc question: which architecture image should I get, the x86 or the x64 one?
 guest345345: thanks, that is the info I was not aware of
 dreinull_:  latest beta is april 26 :)
 Confirmed: Edubuntu just got it's FINAL torrent dvd out! :)
 Confirmed: http://releases.ubuntu.com/natty/ has the FINAL images listed! :) Happy downloading!
 Incarus6: check back a few minutes later, I AM downloading the release images right now, with PROPER names
 nashj: it is not a misstake, you just took a wrong turn XD
