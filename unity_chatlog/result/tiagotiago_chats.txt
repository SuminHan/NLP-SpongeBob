 Hi
 I tried upgrading from 10.10 to 11.somthing and it failed, it said somthing about running dpkg --configure -a but it didn't work , i tried doing that myself and i got http://paste.ubuntu.com/600935/ in response, what should i do?
 Oi Guest
 Is there an installer i can run on Windows to install Ubuntu (on another partition) ?

 Damn, after it failed to upgrade to 11.somthing i can't boot Ubuntu anymore :(
 says somthing along the lines of "the drive for / is not ready to mount"
 Wubi doesn't install Ubuntu the same way the bootable cd/dvd does, right?
 Can i install Ubuntu from Windows the same way it is done with the bootable installer disk?
 okenobi: opened a program i shouldn't have and had to reboot and now it won't boot, it complains about / not being ready to be mounted or somthing

 oops
 kinda, i have a general idea of what chrooting is, but no idea how it is actually done
 I've been without my desktop machine for months, and just moved in to a new place, gotta search for virgin media and download an image
 opening
 that is not how you call it in English?
 blank disks
 yeah
 bought new mobo video card and case, got all the parts yesterday
 brb gonna see if i can find a blank disk on the unpacked boxes
 Hm, wait, can i install from a 2GB usb stick?
 The ISO is both a live disk and a installer, right?
 If i use that universal installer thingy to place the iso on a usb stick, will i be able to install using that?
 usb
 i wanna use a USB stick to install on a HDD partition
 how big does the stick needs to be?
 the previous upgrades didn't had so many issues, did they? They all went smoothlly for me....
 If i install using the ISO will it erase all the files or if i already have the partitons ready it will just copy over the files involved in the install?
 The disk i'll be installt 11.04 already got dualboot set to boot Linux and Windows, is my Windows partition under any risk if i install Ubuntu  again?
 perhaps it would better if there was some triage going here so the flow of text wasn't so fast, i'm having a hard time keeping up, specially if i try to do anything else :(
 be back in a bit
 back
 hm, gotta go, 8mll see if i can come back later let you guys know how things went
 cya
