 sooo, I was building QT 4.7.2 and was getting a few of the same issues with the PCH being not there, cant find a file etc.. so I would either touch <missing file> or mkdir <missing file> which fixed it everytime and it continued building, however my question is this:  What are the odds of this breaking the installation and having QT not function the way it was or is intended to? would it be fairly high?
