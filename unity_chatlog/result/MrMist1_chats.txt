 I'm having problems with hdparm.conf... anyone here with any experience? I'm using natty
 Ubuntu Natty seems to skip hdparm.conf during bootup... my settings for spinning down the HD is ignored completely. Anyone want to help me solve this?
 I'm desperate.. Need to sort out how to set a "spin down" parameter with hdparm.. I can't do it in Natty..
 Froq: ps -ef | grep py ?
 ohsix: It doesn't seem to be read during boot.. My hd doesn't spin down
 Froq: How about just searching through the processes using "ps -ef | less" ?
 ohsix: Sure does... If I use hdparm -S 4, it spins down in 20 seconds time
 ohsix: So hdparm -S 5 isn't the same as spindown_time = 5?
 ohsix: I thought they were supposed to be equivalent
 ohsix: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601444/
 ohsix: Any idea? I seriously don't think this is the drive, since the -S parameter works fine..
 ohsix: man hdparm doesn't say anything about apm. Do you mean that hdparm.conf demands other set values of the disks APM-parameter than the hdparm -y/hdparm -S commands?
 ohsix: Well... interesting thing this. I'm trying to set the APM value by using hdparm.conf, but the hdparm -I command still returns 254
 ohsix: It worked on 10.04
 ohsix: Hey.. I'm not doing anything more than "hdparm -S 32". And voila, it works. Then I set hdparm.conf to /dev/sdd { spindown_time = 32 }, and it's not working
 I haven't done ANYTHING else with HDparm
 ohsix: How can you see? By hdparm -I ?
 ohsix: Hmm... strange
 ohsix: Is there any way to detect that the script is actually being run during boot?
 ohsix: I'm running a "ubuntu-server" machine... don't know it that matters. I've also got the disks mounted via fstab... but I still want them to spin down
 ohsix: rgr: Simple, really. I've got three drives. One for the OS.  The second drive contains home folders (samba shared). They're being used maybe once or twice a day. To have the disk spinning all the time is a waste of energy, and it's noisy. The third drive is the backup drive. I'm going to script it to copy drive 2 once every night. It's never being used for anything else. Hence, two of the drives should be spun down.
 ohsix: Yeah, it was meant for the other guy. I just wanted to tell you as well :) He wondered why I needed to spin them down :)
 ohsix: I've changed the script /lib/udev/hdparam now... touching a file when it's run. Trying to boot to check if the file is being created
 ohsix: It's ok.. it's just for debugging purposes. Hehe
 ohsix: Thanks. I'm booting now to see if the script creates the file
 ohsix: The hdparm.called was NOT created during boot. Which again means that /lib/udev/hdparm is not being called
 ohsix: Ehm.. but I'm just booting using "sudo reboot", not a physical on/off. Should I try that?
 ohsix: Strange... tried your test, and it still says it's trying running the file, but no "hdparm.called" file is being created
 but it should create the file as soon as the script is run.. and it hasn't been created
 ohsix: I called "head /lib/udev/hdparm" - http://paste.ubuntu.com/601453/
 ohsix: Couldn't I just create a .sh file calling "hdparm -S 120 /dev/sdd ?
 ohsix: Hehe... I know. But where would I place such a script?
 ohsix: Should I create a bug report or something about this issue?
 ohsix: I don't know if I know enough about udev to be able to find where the fault is ?
 Edd: Yep... having problems with hdparm.
 ohsix: but it's not being run..
 ohsix: I'm really grateful for the help, but I don't want to keep you from eating
 ohsix: Hmm... interesting. When I call "sudo DEVNAME=/dev/sdd /lib/udev/hdparm" I get "No disk enabled. Exiting"
 ohsix: I tried doing a "sudo sh -" first as well, and calling it without sudo... same result
 ohsix: eeeh... "sudo su -" not "sudo sh -"
 ohsix: Identical results, all of them
 ohsix: "No disk enabled. Exiting"
 ohsix: It's nothing in it almost
 ohsix: hmm... I've got an idea..
 ohsix: http://paste.ubuntu.com/601466/
 I'm commenting out the "quiet" line now... wonder if that's the issue
 ohsix: argh... still same result after commenting out the line
 ohsix: I did, but since the file isn't being called anyway
 ohsix: I removed them again. Less is more
 ohsix: I had "apm = 127" before, but it did nothing.
 ohsix: aaah... there's a stray }?? Didn't see that one..
 ohsix: Now we're talking.. it's being run now...
 ohsix: Seems like it's working now for the two drives I have mountet, but the backup-drive which I'm not mounting won't go into standby mode. Any idea why? Can I place it in standby mode during boot?
 ohsix: Hmm... Can't get sdd into sleep mode, but the two other drives works perfectly. Is it because I don't mount it somehow? I don't need to have it mounted..
 ohsix: Hehe... by mounting the drive through fstab, it now goes into sleep mode. I'm not setting any APM parameter at all in any config. Thanks for all the help by the way
 ohsix: I'm using hdparam.conf just like before. No changes except the brace
 ohsix: Gotta go... thanks for all the help though :)
 kjxl9: Specify what you need help with..
 kjxl9: use tab extensions... like "cd /home/a<tab>/Dow<tab>"
 kjxl9: If <tab> doesn't give you anything, try "<tab><tab>" to list possible selections..
