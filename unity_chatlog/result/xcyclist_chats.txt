 okay, I just had a disaster installing 11.04.  Please suggest what to do next.
 I should say, upgrading to 11.04 from 10.00
 It resized my window and gave me new menu settings I do not want.
 Don't Install 11.04!!  It's a disaster!!!
 Pici:  So, I am default logging in.  There is an item on the login menu that allows me to choose?
 Pici:  Thank you Pici.  That is very helpful.
 Say, why do I only have 1024x768 resolution now on my laptop with the 11.04 upgrade?  This makes it very frustrating to use?
 I would have been much better off not upgrading with this fubar.
 Halzen:  Can I find that out from proc?  I don't know where to look.

 Looks like I've lost my contact for 11.04 video resolution degeneration help.  My video is:  Video chipsets: Intel HD Graphics 256MB NVIDIA速 Quadro速 NVS3100M
 Is there a fixit list somewhere for Thinkpad Lenovo T410 to undo all the things 11.04 breaks on that kind of laptop?

 I'd be glad to submit bugs, but launchpad isn't getting me to the new bug menu today, so I'll have to pass.
 Thank you LjL.
