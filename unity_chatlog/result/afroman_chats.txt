 usr13: a way to clean the hd so that nothing can be retrieve after
 dasy2k1: can one retrieve data after? or is it completely gone?
 thx
 usr13: thx
 dasy2k1: thx
 dasy2k1: usr13: but is there another way to wipe out just the empty space?
 dasy2k1: so is there a way?
 usr13: do U know a way to wipe out just the empty space?
 usr13: I don't know ... the free space on a partition
 usr13: what do U mean?
 usr13: I don't think we understand each other
 usr13: on a partion, there is used space (containning the data) and free space. I want to wipe out clean just the free space so that nothing can be retrieved.
 usr13: I get that. but can U just write zeros on JUST The free space?
 usr13: thx
