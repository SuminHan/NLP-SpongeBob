 hi guys, i had a question. I'm running 10.10 right now and am wondering if there's any difference in system stability whether I install 11.04 brand new or just do an upgrade
 guest345345: thanks...is there a way to backup the current system i have?
 guest345345: i don't know, i was wondering if there's a way i could just make a snapshot of my current system in case the new version doesn't work for me
 guest345345: well 10.10 is considered stable but it was a pain in the ass to get working properly on my sony laptop
 JR0cket1: the liveCD doesn't work well for me, the 10.10 liveCD made it seem as if ubuntu wouldn't run on my machine at all
 JR0cket1, guest345345: i had to change video, network and other drivers just to get it to work. I didn't know it was possible to install drivers with a LiveCD?
 elzoog: what time zone are you in
 elzoog: GMT+ ?
 anyone know what time GMT the new version is coming out?
 oh i see, thanks Djones
 JR0cket1: oh ok, thats a good idea. I tried creating a bootable usb for 10.10 but kept getting "boot error' on startup
 could someone explain to a complete newbie like me whether I should use ubuntu or kubuntu? I don't get the difference really...
 if I didn't create a swap partition when i installed 10.10 (i have two partitions on the laptop drive but one is for win7), does that mean I can't hibernate the system?
 velcroshooz: oh i see. I should still be able to suspend though right?
 velcroshooz: ok cool
 trying to figure out why no matter what i try my laptop won't suspend/standby. Well actually it will suspend but when i try to turn it back on it boots up just like a cold boot
 guest345345: i already had a 10gb partition made for ubuntu and i just installed ubuntu onto that.
 is making a win7 partition smaller to create space for a new partition (for ubuntu swap) considered a workaround or is it as good as setting up a partition on a clean drive from scratch?
 guest345345: yeah its way more reliable than ubuntu
 guest345345: i see, thank you
 guest345345: when you say "allocate the recommended swap partition" do you mean a third partition? I have a 500 GB drive and made a 490 GB NTFS win7 partition and a 10 GB ext4 ubuntu partition. Can the swap file be put on that same 10gb ext4 partition?
 guest345345: will it create a new partition automatically? sorry i'm being unclear about it, trying to understand
 guest345345: oh ok
 guest345345: oh ok
 guest345345: oh ok. when i do fdisk -l i see an NTFS partition then an Extended and a third Linux one
 is unity still kinda unpolished in its look?
 Incarus6: wow gnome 3 looks nicer than unity
 mythri: this might help you: http://ext2read.blogspot.com/
 http://www.gnome3.org/img/search-big.png that looks kinda like the unity screenshot
 whats plymouth?
 oh ok
 yeah i had problems with it because i had to use nvidia drivers instead of nouveau
 why are proprietary drivers not preferred over open source ones?
 ohh i see
 i tried the nouveau ones for my laptops nvidia card and kept having problems with it and then after installing the nvidia ones it worked perfectly
 any way to quickly check from cli which driver i'm actually using (not sure if i uninstalled nouveau, i remember i needed it for plymouth i think)
 guest345345: any way to quickly check from cli which driver I'm actually using (not sure if I uninstalled nouveau, remember needing it for plymouth i think) thanks
 guest345345: thanks for all the help. I had another question. If I made a liveCD to install 11.04 from, boot it up, format the current 10.10 partition and leave the win7 NTFS one alone, will my current GRUB2 dual boot menu be totally borked
 dreinull_: no its not
 dreinull_: thats the beta
 here its 2:32 AM
 dreinull_: are you getting the final ?
 dreinull_: where from, and how are you sure its not a beta?
 if i use a usb liveCD and then install from it, will the settings that I had setup in the liveCD carry over?
 arand: i tried out the 11.04 liveCD and there was no Unity, it looked exactly the same as my 10.10 install
 arand: thanks. So I have a question. On my 10.10 I have to use proprietary nvidia drivers which allow my screen to have the proper resolution and for compiz to work but make my plymouth look terrible.  When I used 11.04 liveCD everything looked fine, but there was no Unity. Does this mean I'll have to go to proprietary drivers again in 11.04 for Unity?
 Why do I keep getting this error when I try to run update manager on 10.10 : W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/meerkat/stable/ubuntu/dists/maverick/main/source/Sources.gz  404  Not Found
 Why do I keep getting this error when I try to run update manager on 10.10 : W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/meerkat/stable/ubuntu/dists/maverick/main/source/Sources.gz  404  Not Found
 ohsix: is there a command in terminal i can enter to do that?
 jiohdi: thanks
 does canonical release a new version every 6 months whether or not the version is really stable? Are they very locked into the 6 month timeline?
 maco: oh i see. Is there a huge jump in # of adopters AFTER its considered out of beta?
 maco: i'm switching to ubuntu from 20 years of windows and i love the ideology of ubuntu but it still seems kind of hodge podge at best so far (my experience with 10.10). It could just be my hardware though. I hope to report on bugs though.
 dotblank: it could just be my hardware but setting up ubuntu 10.10 wasnt easy at all
 dotblank: thats why I was wondering whats considered a stable release
 dotblank: i get the feeling that ubuntu works really well on stuff 5 years old and pretty poorly on stuff 1-2 years old.  Is that correct?
 usr13: i'm def no linux master but I appreciate the difference in looks and user interface. I don't mind that at all. I just haven't experienced an ubuntu install yet where I didn't have to scour through forum posts to get hardware to work properly.
 my sony vaio and hp pavilion laptops have both had hardware issues on a default install
 ohsix: i don't mind searching forums for solutions.
 ohsix: i agree with the process, I'm just saying that I don't understand what is the definition of stable
 ohsix: know of any laptop that would have the same out of the box functionality with Ubuntu as Win7? I must just have bad luck with the two I have
 ohsix: yeah i don't even expect those to work ever when i'm installing ubuntu
 if I'm going to completely wipe my 10.10 install and install 11.04 in its place, what are some steps I should take before wiping (besides backing up my data) that will let me get back to the same setup on 11.04? Thanks!
 Bluebill-Wolf: the ubuntu versions are just based on when they're released. 11 = 2011, 04 = April
 octillion: i have a 500 gb drive with a lot of free space but my ubuntu is on a 10gb partition and the remaining 490 is a win7 partition. Anything I could do?
 octillion: can i pm?
 how's it going usr13
 i'm installing ubuntu 11.04 and it keeps hanging at the very end due to nvidia drivers not being found, although on the liveUSB trial run there were no problems
 is it possible to torrent the updates?
 11.04 keeps stopping during installation due to a lack of nvidia-current. What can I do to fix this? Thank you.
 is there a way to torrent all the updates with the ISO instead of sitting here waiting for it to download from Canonical?
 Starminn: doing a fresh install
 Starminn: i already have the liveCD iso, put it on a USB, installing from it currently, but its installing so many things slowly
 Downloading at 16 kB/s reminds me of being on a US Robotics modem back in the day
 daxt: i'm in california
 zvacet: how do you download updates from torrent?
 zvacet: i have the liveUSB installing but it has been installing ubiquity for a long time now
 daxt: nope, parents are from Pakistan
 ask my son.
 daxt: oh ok cool, i didn't know it was common in Sri Lanka also
 maxmahem: whats the problem with your grub?
 maxmahem: do you have a liveCD?
 maxmahem: in liveCD, open terminal then type sudo -i
 maxmahem: then: mount /dev/sda5 (sda5 is where your Ubuntu is, change as needed)
 maxmahem: then: grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda
 maxmahem: then reboot and it should find your proper entries, then you can go into your ubuntu and from terminal do: sudo grub-install /dev/sda
 maxmahem: go to a liveCD, then do those commands
 Dania: sorry i only knew the answer to maxmahem's issue because i had the same problem myself a week ago. I'm actually really new to Ubuntu and don't know much at all
 wow that was a complete disappointment. 11.04 install fails during install and freezes up about 5 minutes before being completely finished over and over again.
 bencc: nope, it requires compiz, which requires 3D acceleration
 Soothsayer: whats the prob you're having with your nvidia card? I'm having major issues too
 Soothsayer: ah ok
 Soothsayer: i keep having 11.04 crash on install due to my nvidia 330GT
 wow i guess a watched ubuntu install never finishes. Left it on overnight and it had actually installed w/o erroring out this time.
 shugyosha: whats your issue?
 TiagoTiago: yep
 shugyosha: i just joined the channel :P
 TiagoTiago: yeah, thats how i did it
 guys is there a way to use Unity without the keyboard to find an app?
 phibxr: i just did, it worked fine for me
 phibxr: i have no idea what gdebi is :P
 Kibo: are you trying to hide the grub screen?
 Is it possible to use open source nouveau drivers for plymouth and grub2 but use nvidia drivers once i login?
 Is it possible to use open source nouveau drivers for plymouth and grub2 but use nvidia drivers once i login?
 guys i'm using grub customizer and for some reason none of the settings I'm saving with it are showing up when i do sudo update-grub, instead i see old settings still being setup in the grub update. Any fix possible for this? Much appreciated.
 is there a way to use the nouvea drivers for grub2 and plymouth?
 Sidewinder1: where is the Hardware Drivers section?
 Sidewinder1: thanks, i don't seem to have that menu option on 11.04 64bit
 sidewalk: no need to be sorry, appreciate you taking the time to even answer
 Sidewinder1: thanks
 Sidewinder1: i have another question -- is there a way i can have File System show up in my Places dropdown menu in top panel?
 Sidewinder1: yea it shows up in my Home folder's left panel also but not in my Places dropdown from top panel...pretty annoying!
 Sidewinder1: not sure haha, i just end up having to go in there quite a bit. All my media is on a different partition which is mounted, and then for some stuff i have to go into file system
 is there a way to have your status in ubuntu set to "busy" automatically on login? or is there some script i could write to do that? thank you
 why does unity require so many more mouseclicks to get to an app compared to gnome2? Am I doing something wrong?
 arrrghhh: i see
 arrrghhh: yeah i'm trying to get used to Unity but its just hard to imagine anything being more efficient than a tree hierarchy
 arrrghhh: will give it some more time
 Edd: i had the usual pain in the ass that comes with having an nvidia graphics card
 ohsix: are you using 11.04 and if so are you using unity or not?
 to all the wise ubuntu experts, is there a way I can have my laptop load up in powersave mode every time I boot? Right now I have to manually select it using a gnome2 panel applet to throttle the cpu down.  Thank you very much.
 ChogyDan: On boot its always in OnDemand mode
 ohsix: yeah exactly, thermal reasons
 ohsix: its just my laptop is a beast and makes a ton of heat. know of a way to make it not start in ondemand?
 ohsix: what would you recommend?
 ChogyDan: any ideas?
 ohsix: oh its not ubuntu specific, its the laptop. Its an i7 with a poorly designed fan system
 ohsix: its so poorly designed they forced a recall/BIOS update on the system that makes the stupid fans just stay almost at full all the time to cover their ass from lawsuits
 ohsix: there's nothing in the bios except boot order. very basic bios
 ohsix: ah well i tried using sensors detect with lm-sensors and it only found a few
 ChogyDan: thank you, I did sudo vim /etc/init.d/ondemand  -- if you had a few spare moments could you provide me with further instructions?
 ChogyDan: found it
 ChogyDan: ok, whats the difference between powersave and conservative?
 ChogyDan: ok
 is there a way to run the sensors-applet with a flag?
 stupid dropbox keeps not auto-starting at boot
 Datz: i think you can choose to login to Ubuntu Classic for the non-Unity version
 Datz: what happens?
 Datz: can you highlight me?
 Datz: thanks
 was just testing something Datz
 is there anyway I can make my laptop's touchpad not take any input while i'm typing? getting so frustrated with accidentally palming the touchpad and it messing me up
 [4-tea-2]: ha ha, any real solution that you know of?
 belinrahs: yes you can get ubuntu-tweaks
 belinrahs: it will let you change it to your display name rather than username
 belinrahs: no i dont think so...just google ubuntu-tweak and download the deb
 belinrahs: awesome. i don't know much about ubuntu but thats one thing i've learned
 how can I reverse the steps If I did this command from terminal: "echo "options psmouse proto=imps"|sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse.conf; sudo modprobe -r psmouse; sudo modprobe psmouse"

 is there a way to theme a single icon in gnome's panel? (don't want to change my entire theme, just want to make one system tray icon fit into it)
 ohsix: cool, whats fd.o ? Also, do you ever sleep? :P
 ohsix: haha nice, what timezone are you in
 ohsix: cool, same here, in SF
 !ask | Guest__
 whats with the un-regged channel all of a sudden
 slinker1: true haha
 JoseeAntonioR: download compiz settings manager, in there that options exists under Unity Tweak
 JoseeAntonioR: CompizConfig Settings Manager
 JoseeAntonioR: ccsm
 JoseeAntonioR: i installed ubuntu-tweak first and then used that to setup CCSM. ubuntu-tweaks has a lot of good features in it besides that. google the download site for it.
 n00b question: is there anything similar to TeamViewer for Windows for Ubuntu?
 my plymouth loads fine until the very end when it goes to a black screen and i see some cron status messages. How can I make it so that I don't see any text screen in plymouth and go straight to the login?
 has anyone been able to save their information in the About Me section in 11.04?
 anyone have the issue of About Me not saving their info?
 wow, i can't believe libreoffice shipped with ubuntu. its such an unfinished piece of junk
 Blue_Opal: really? I haven't really had much issues with open office
 Blue_Opal: theres a huge disconnect between Ubuntu's website which likes to play up the finished product ready for windows users to switch to and the actual product which isn't user friendly in the least
 Emylbus: if you're a new user i would just choose '/'
 Emylbus: no prob, i'm new to ubuntu too, just started :P
 Emylbus: i always do. if you don't have anything on there, might as well
 has anyone experienced the bug where 11.04 all of a sudden just logs out, saving nothing, and presenting the login screen?
 uRock: libreoffice this time, but before its been terminal
 how can I see the error logs of what happened?
 jenkinSear: here's mine -- any look weird in it? http://pastie.org/1855166
 jenkinSear: any other log files i should look at?
 DrGrov: you could use the dd command, thats what I do
 DrGrov: ok one sec
 DrGrov: you can backup the entire ubuntu partition to either another partition or an external hard drive
 jenkinSear: how would i reinstall my nvidia drivers?
 jenkinSear: how would i reinstall my nvidia drivers?
 how can i find out which driver i have installed for my display?
 Chipzzz: hmm ok so i see a nvidia, uvesafb, vesafb, and video. Does that mean I'm using proprietary or default?

 why does my X keep crashing like a mofo?
 what log should I look at right after all of a sudden Ubuntu logs me out in the middle of something?
 celthunder: thanks for helping
 celthunder: i was trying to get my virtual terminal to work... :/
 celthunder: i'm not sure what that means...
 celthunder: if I do CTRL+ALT+F1 it shows my regular desktop, on ctrl+alt+f2 it goes to a black screen
 celthunder: but its a blank screen, nothing on it
 celthunder: yeah...it should be F7 was my desktop
 celthunder: err it used to be F7
 celthunder: could i PM you if you're not terribly busy?
 what does the vga=795 mean in grub kernel options?
 ZykoticK9: how comes its in there by default? should I just remove it? I don't want my resolution to be 795 if thats what it does
 ZykoticK9: 11.04
 bullgard4: i can comment out GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX and instead put in GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX ?
 Jordan_U: : i can comment out GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX and instead put in GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX ?
 Jordan_U: just cleaning up my grub file that i was editing around
 Jordan_U: ok thanks, whats the 'splash' mean on the same line?
 Jordan_U: very informative, thank you. Is quiet the opposite of splash?
 KNUBBIG: doesn't work for me either :) just see a black screen until the login screen
 KNUBBIG: yeah i see my grub page perfectly but then after that its black screen until login. Its because of stupid nvidia drivers or something from what I've read
 KNUBBIG: this may work for you: http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/
 KNUBBIG: it didn't work for me though
 KNUBBIG: do your virtual terminals work?
 purvesh: try it without the quotes
 hi usr13
 could anyone help me with why my tty's dont work? If I do "telinit 3" it returns nothing.
 usr13: do you know what could be causing my virtual terminals to just give a black screen?
 usr13: i didn't turn them off...my plymouth doesn't show either, i'm thinking its some video driver issues...could you help?
 usr13: yeah i guess so, everything else is a black screen.
 usr13: not sure if its because of driver display issues or what
 usr13: crazy how you're multitasking, sorry about the PM, i mistook you for someone else
 but usr13 what resolution would the console terminals be displaying in? Could it be that its requiring some 2D driver or bios video driver and since I have nvidia 3D proprietary drivers its causing issues?
 sup all
 is there a reason my desktop display is on VT 8 instead of 7? Ubuntu 11.04
 shcherbak: which log?
 thanks shcherbak. Is there a way to determine which VT i'm on at bootup?
 anytime I switch to a tty (virtual terminal), not only does my X crash but my tty text asking for me to login is wavy/blurry. I'm using nvidia proprietary drivers. Could anyone assist me please? Thank you.

 is there a way i can transfer my currently installed ubuntu partition to my USB flash drive and just have it boot from there?
 is there a way i can transfer my currently installed ubuntu partition to my USB flash drive and just have it boot from there?
 DasEi: yea my ubuntu partition is 10gb and my usb is 16GB. If I use dd, do i need to do anything for grub?
 DasEi: so i keep my grub2 on my box's MBR, and as long as the usb is plugged in prior to boot, it should find it?
 DasEi: i have another question, how can i run a java jnlp file?
 is there a way i can transfer my currently installed ubuntu partition to my USB flash drive and just have it boot from there?
 could someone help me copy my ubuntu installation on a partition on my hard drive to my USB flash drive?
 bullgard4: I have ubuntu 11.04 installed on one 10gb partition of my laptop's hard drive along with Win7 on another partition (490gb). Grub2 is on the MBR. I would like to duplicate my 10GB ubuntu install onto my 16GB flash memory drive and make it so that I could boot from it. I'm not very skilled but am eager to learn.

 bullgard4: whats that mean
 does the 64bit ubuntu iso also have the 32bit version on it?
 wow, i guess my old HP laptop is actually 64bit then...all this time i'd been installing 32bit on it and then yesterday i accidentally forgot and used a 64bit liveUSB to install
 sudocomm: i have the same "error" but it seems to work on my vaio with nvidia
 ActionParsnip: no thats not my issue
 ActionParsnip: i thought my old HP was only 32-bit capable
 ActionParsnip: thanks, appreciate it
 whats your question yehudah_
 yehudah_: oh i dont know sorry
 yehudah_: maybe you could just have the command in some wakeup script?
 yehudah_: or like make a script and put it in startup applications
 yehudah_: where it does like "sleep 60" and then turns it on
 yehudah_: i'm not sure of the details, only been using linux for a week
 fellas, is there a way to install Ubuntu to a usb flash drive and make it so that it will have the drivers to work on any computer i take it to?
 Xylch: hmm but i always have to choose the "try ubuntu" option then? i mean is there a way to install it on there but still have it be hardware agnostic
 Jordan_U: oh wow ok i didn't know that. very cool. so if i do install proprietary drivers and then use it on a computer where the proprietary drivers aren't needed, will it work? Or say i go from a system that doesn't need pro drivers to a system that does?
 Jordan_U: yea i have 16gb on the pen drive
 Jordan_U: thank you, could I PM you?
 oh ok
 Jordan_U: i'm in an ubuntu install right now, have my 16GB pen drive, and the ISO file. How can I install to my usb drive. Making a startup disk is different, I imagine.
 Jordan_U: i see. no way to "run" the ISO from my current install?
 Jordan_U: ok, thank you
 Jordan_U: 6GB
 Jordan_U: not installed
 Jordan_U: should i install it?
 Jordan_U: Your CPU supports KVM extensions. KVM (vmx) is disabled by your BIOS.
 Jordan_U: i know where to turn it on in my bios though
 Jordan_U: very helpful. thank you. once i enable it in my BIOS what would I do? Is it a gui app?
 Jordan_U: thats ok, I can do stuff on CLI with some instruction. Would i basically be mounting the ISO to cdrom or something?
 Jordan_U: ok, i can do that part with fdisk -l
 Jordan_U: very cool. :)
 Jordan_U: thank you again for all of your help. Going to try this out :)
 Jordan_U: will do
 whats the -m 2G flag mean Jordan_U ?
 Jordan_U: oh no worries, i'm a n00b to linux but not a n00b to doing due diligence when messing around on computers :P
 Jordan_U: thanks again, will be back in a bit!
 I'm trying to copy an image of my ubuntu install to my USB flash drive. How can I make it so that there's a GRUB install on the usb flash drive too after I use dd to copy it over? Thank you very much.

 I'm having a problem with GRUB. I made a duplicate image of my laptop's ubuntu install onto a USB flash drive, now when I try to boot from the USB flash drive on the laptop, even if I select the grub entry that points to my USB drive, it still loads the version on the laptop's hard drive unless I edit the grub entry and change the set root=UUID=' ' area to the /dev/sdb1 (where the usb image is). Could anyone help please?
