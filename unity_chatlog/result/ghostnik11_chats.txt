 hi wanted to know what peoples thoughts on ubuntu 11.04 and how they would rate it compared to 10.10 which i am currently on, don't know if i should update yet?
 iceroot: yeah but i updated from 9.1 to 10.04 to 10.10 using the upgrade manager
 iceroot: worked well with no problems
 stefg: okay will make note of that, thanks, i will just make a backup of my files, but it will be hard to backup like the programs and stuff
 iceroot: no i wanted to find out if 11.04 was better than 10.10, i mean i thought the new version of ubuntu the better it is
 iceroot: okay you got me thinking i should just stay with 10.10 which runs fantastic on my ibm thinkpad t60
 iceroot: i know i will just test 11.04 through virtualbox and see if its really as good, then will do back up and then do install
 okay thanks for info, have websites for backup computer
