 hi I just installed 11.04 and I have 2 xscreens.. however I only see launchers and panels on the main x screen.. how do i configure the 2nd screen
 botcity, no i want to keep them seperate
 botcity, i had the same setup with 10.10 running gnome
 yeah.. i can have 1 desktop on 1 screen and 2 on the second.. i like that setup
 does anyone know if there is an issue installing gnome 3 on ubuntu 11.04
 zvacet, nanomad well unity is not working to start with
 nanomad, i have 2 x screens.. i see everything only on the main xscreen.. nothing on the 2nd xscreen
 zvacet, yes and it complained about lots of packages missing
 Pepro, and any issues?
 this time i chose Ubuntu classic at login and i see Gnome
 however, i see window decorations on only 1 screen
 the other screen windows do not have title bars nor am i able to type in them
 any clues?
 Dr_Willis, nvidia Quadro NVS 420
 Dr_Willis, i am not running unity
 Dr_Willis, nanomad: is there a solution or do i have to roll back
 Dr_Willis, i logged out and chose the Ubuntu classic from the login menu
 nanomad, but i am using Ubuntu classic (gnome)
 Dr_Willis, i have 3 monitors, 1 monitor on 1st xscreen and 2 monitors (with twinview) on 2nd x screen
 Dr_Willis, i had the same issue with 10.10 and then someone here made me run a window decorator and that fixed it
 Dr_Willis, i dont think compiz is running
 Dr_Willis, metacity replace fixes the issue
 Dr_Willis, but i did not get the prompt back
 Dr_Willis, and if i kill it, both screens go bad
 Dr_Willis, do i have to do that everytime i login?
 Dr_Willis, so i cant use compiz on this
 Dr_Willis, it was working great on 10.10
