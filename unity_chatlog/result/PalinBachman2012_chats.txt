 unity is a compiz plugin
 im getting 404's trying to install some programs
 you can get that back, i think
 jonii2: Ubuntu IS unity
 Ubuntu Classic is the old style
 jonii2: have you tried installing compiz settings, and enabling unity there
 jonii2: ussually if unity is not your default desktop, then the system thinks your card cannot handle accelleration
 so it disables it
 zsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/natty-desktop-amd64.iso.zsync in the dir with the old file just worked for me
 jonii2: you click the box next to unity
 jonii2: you installed compizconfig-settings-manager and Ubuntu Unity Plugin is not in the Desktop settings? If so, I would think maybe you are not upgraded properly
 jonii2: what video card do you have, and does the 'restricted drivers' thinggee show up
 jonii2: then you should be good to go, once you get unity installed
 twig111: your HD might be full, or else, the ubuntu servers might be getting hammered and the connection is being interupted
 twig111: they might be moving some DNS stuff around, but IDK
 twig111: i had some probs installing from aptitude that were related to dns and/or wrong moved ips
 jonii2: its white? its supposed to be a dark theme, iirc
 jonii2: i guess in your appearance settings
 jonii2: you have to press the win key and start typing the name
 I didnt like Unity at firest, but now i like it, once i added some nice hotcorners
 Barridus: its not the prettiest, but it works for me
 Barridus: to see it you need to click on the mail envelope, and then on notifications
 jonii2: i think you might b e having probs with multiple moniters
 bluefoxicy: install compizsettings and change your number of destops
 is the compizconfig-settings-manager
 that gnome shell ppa will break unity, use jhbbuild
 jonii2: you are using the restricted drivers from nvidia?
 jonii2: hmm
 jonii2: you might need to file a bug report...
 jonii2: did you upgrade, or do a fresh install?
 jonii2: you might try creating a new user, logging out completly, and logging in as him
 jonii2: it can be when things go wrong, like in an upgrade
 tensorpudding: \0/
 jonii2: so its a configuration issue of some sort, held over from your previous installs and tweaks
 jonii2: so you can move your windows, and your theme looks fine now?
 jonii2: lol
 i like UNITY
 i didnt at first, tho
