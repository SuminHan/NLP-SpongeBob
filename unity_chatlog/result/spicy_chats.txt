 Hello I have a question. I have an Intel machine and I wish to download the new 64bit version of Ubuntu, but when I try to download the 64bit it downloads the AMD version (I have an intel processor not an AMD processor). Where is the Intel 64bit version of Ubuntu?
 So it doesn't matter if I run an AMD 64bit on an Intel machine? Okay then, I'll download AMD 64 bit
 myrkraverk thanks for clearing things up
