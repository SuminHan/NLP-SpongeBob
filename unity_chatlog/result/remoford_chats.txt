 where did the network places go in unity, like the ssh and samba connect to server bookmarks?
 unity is working pretty well, but just cant find "places" anymore
 upgrade worked for me but it took 7hrs, servers very slow
 tanath: yeah i didnt mind much, watched a stream as it upgraded
 if only i could find out where the network places bookmarks went
