 Hi!
 hey
 when running update-grub, I get:
 "  Parse error at byte 54 (line 3): unexpected token"
 umm, but which file?
 iceroot, thx, will take a look
 hmm
 line 3 of that file is a comment
 iceroot, how do you guess that?
 iceroot, aha
 why doesn't it just output sensible error messages?
 you know, I am trying to repair my boot config
 "change" is relative
 the file might just be broken
