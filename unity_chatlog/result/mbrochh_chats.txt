 just updated to 11.04... how do i activate the new desktop? everything still looks the same as it did before the update
 Starminn, I restarted several times?
 what is the name of that fancy new desktop that comes with 11.04?
 is it unity?
 does anybody know if it is possible to enjoy unity when running ubuntu on a virtualbox?
 i can't seem to be able to activate it
 paddy_, damn
 Maddogm, i am using latest virtualbox 4.0.6 - any special settings to do to get it working?
 Maddogm, working on it...
 Maddogm, it worked! great!
 petey, Maddogm thanks for your help
 when i log out my session and log in again it often happens that the top panel loses its theme (using unity)... how can i restore it?
 how can i prevent ubuntu from locking the screen after some idle time?
