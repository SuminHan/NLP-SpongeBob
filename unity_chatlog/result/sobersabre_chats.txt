 hi. I am on 10.10
 I want to change default resolution of the console. tried messing with grub2, but it has no effect. I think I need to do something related to fb, but I don't know how with grub2.
 I added gfxpayload=1024x768x16
 histo: ok. trying... will be back.
 vbeinfo is supposed to print out the vga modes list ?
 histo: the above line was for you :)
 histo: I ran vbeinfo in grub shell.
 there was no "771" in it
 I wrote down and it looks like 0x117 (which would translate into 279)
 qin: so can I use the hex. codes from vbeinfo output ?
 histo: thanks, there.
 histo: I've tried your link, and implemented.
 As of now during the boot - GRUB2 does set the graphic mode correctly. BUT after that somehow the setup changes to something I don't want.
 soreau: sorry to be rude.   do you know what I am talking about ?
 soreau: are you a bot ?
 soreau: I'm trying to reconfigure console resolution.
 soreau: intel
 smw: aye.
 smw: I have yet to change vga=xxx, which I will try now.
 I tried gfxmode, gfxpayload but it apparently changed only what was happening in grub menu.
 OK. trying now.
 thanks.
 vibhav: to get to a resolution I want in the console.
 smw: are you on grub2 ?
 soreau: preferences->monitors doesn't hold in console :)
 proq: in what context.
 proq: unity is a new (I'm not sure which:) desktop or windows manager.
 soreau: I don't know where does VGA-1 come from.
 vibhav: to do what ?
 and what do you mean "easier" it is easy anyway: edit a text file, and run update-grub.
 vibhav: to change reso of console ?
 soreau: hint would be nice :)
 I like your eagerness to help. initially I thought you're not listening.
 my bad.
 vibhav: not resolution of GRUB
 of console.
 vibhav: ok ?
 vibhav: what irc client are you using? (I know I can /whois you, I prefer asking)
 vibhav: what irc client are you using? (I know I can /whois you, I prefer asking)
