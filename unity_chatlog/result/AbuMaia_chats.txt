 banshee does not show as active in the launcher when running. Bug?
 awesome bot reply for root :)
 tss2: nope
 tss2: why? because 11.04 isn't LTS?
 tss2: this early in the game, there's gonna be almost all negative reviews until people get used to it
 NictraSavios: I'm having very little difficulty with Unity so far. I need admit nothing I do not agree with
 NictraSavios: then don't put your experiences on me, k?
 NictraSavios: you don't like it, don't use it
 NictraSavios: let others choose their own way
 so far, the only issue I've had with 11.04 is with Banshee
 Is anyone else seeing Banshee not showing as active in the Unity launcher while running?
 vibhav: it may be a separate plugin
