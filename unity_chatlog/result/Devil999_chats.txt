 hi all
 how's it going? any news for 11.04?
 Ziber, i use Unison. I think it's simpler, and has GUI. Your choice!
 sdegutis, is that a question?
 ok, then...
 sdegutis, that's really something. gratz.
 sdegutis, sure thing... just stick around. a lot of talk going to happen.
 chrome_, now i have my doubts.
 chrome_, well, in my case i don't like unity, and am trying to stick with classic (gnome). but some features have been removed, like the tray bar, and the "widgets"
 chrome_, it's the buttons on the left side all over again. canonical says it's better, and we have to stick to it, or walk away.
 thing is, with the buttons we could solve it easily. with these problems it's not that easy, at least not yet. let's wait and see.
 bastien, problem is that i've tried xubuntu, and i don't like it. i love gnome. and i loved my desktop. at least until 11.04.
 djazz, yes.
 djazz, that not so much.
 djazz, sorry, i can't help you with that. i haven't been lucky with handsets and computers.
