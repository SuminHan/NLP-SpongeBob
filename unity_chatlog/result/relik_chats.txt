 hello
 when i try to do "ls *.mpg" i get this error message: ls: invalid option -- ' '
 any idea what causes this?
 why does ls *.avi works but ls *.mpg does not on Ubuntu?
 kwtm: show me files with mpg
 aj00200: i get an error message when i do ls *.mpg
 thats the problem
 kwtm: i know
 just ls *.mpg causes problems
 hmmmm
 maybe its a feature but i consider that a bug
 kwtm: how can you wor around it?
 kwtm: it works
 but it does not work for vlc
 vlc .mpg
 kwtm: yes
 there are some movies with weird characters in them
 ok
 i'll try
 ok
 thank
 that solved the problem
