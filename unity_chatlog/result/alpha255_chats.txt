 anyone got unity 3d working on a lenovo t61p?
 the laptop wasn't plugged in when i did the install

 Flynsarmy: even if i installed the 2d version

 Flynsarmy: ahh
 sudo apt-get install unity-2d
 i'll do the unistall and then try to 3d
 it's wasn't on this laptop
 i wasn't connected to internet during install
