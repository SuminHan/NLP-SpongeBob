 hello massively sized channel
 may i ask for the simpist procedure to get 8 ttys on default boot
 fyi im drunk as hell and running a new version
 is there documentation for upgrade from old long term to new long term
 does anyone know what an inittab is?
 shane4ubuntu: ctrl+alt+f2
 shane4ubuntu: default install pulls up 6 ttys you fucked your xserver im drunk pm me ill swear in channel getting compiz up in ubuntu should be cake work
 and these ppl suck so im out... seriously where the fuck is the default boot spread threw
 is there information on upgrading lts older to lts now
 test: buy a geek and make him install one
 test: is what better then kde?
 test: ysem is a wm?
 ubottu: but but
 test: um super bloat or ubuntu bloat?
 i prefer light linux with gnome libs or less
 but better is more of an opinion
 i hate kde... =)
 unity is a kde gnome mix?
 pfifo: more then likely it works on my non ubuntu kernel since like last year
 if ubuntu when to kde im definetlly uninstalling asap
 i thought it had a chance but after trying to find a way to get 8 ttys up
 and the mounts of upstart backcrap
 when it didnt even seem used i couldnt even grep the /etc and find the vt7
 Incarus6: nice then ill keep trying is there an easy way to get 8ttys for force xorg to tty9
 test: change is good. keep trying to hate your impotence
 Incarus6: yes you seem knowledgeable have you ever used a console?
 Jordan_U: your here?
