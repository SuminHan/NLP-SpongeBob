 hi
 how can i disable this excessively large dropshadow on 11.04?
 i tried compiz/window decoration, but that doesn't change anything
 ohsix: hm, it has to be set somewhere
 ohsix: right now i can just disable all decoration, or have this huge shadow
 ohsix: because i use focus-follows-mouse, the abrupt change of the shadow is quite distracting
 ohsix: ah.  there is a slider for shadow, but it doesn't seem to have any effect
 trism: thanks!
 how do you get a proper menu style, and not that apple menu style?
 how do i get gnome-panel to start by default?
 how can i disable the "maximize when bumping a window to the screen border"?
 soreau: thanks!
 now if i only found how i can switch viewports while dragging windows...
 Lazer-B: sure
