 Ziber: What is currently on the computer?
 Ziber: It should by default. What problem are you having?
 Ziber: What version?
 Ziber: You can upgrade directly to 10.04, and from 10.04 upgrade to 10.10.
 Ziber: It will, especially with the mirrors being hit heavily by users upgrading to 11.04 (which will be released some time in the next 24 hours).
 Ziber: You can also boot from the 10.10 iso with it just stored on your hard drive. Though that's more difficult to do with 8.04's grub legacy it's still possible.
 Herbs: This has nothing to do with $PATH, his root filesystem wasn't mounted properly and he's at an initramfs / busybox shell.
 Herbs: The initramfs doesn't contain fsck.
 Herbs: And so he won't be able to "boot into single user mode and run fsck". fsck is on his root filesystem, which isn't mounting properly at boot.
 renancoelho: Boot a liveCD, run "sudo blkid", pastebin the output (using http://pastebin.ubuntu.com ) and then we can give you step by step directions from there.

 cws: Do you have any kernels in Ubuntu 10.10's /boot/ ?
 cws: If there are no kernels then there will be no menu entries. Do you know why your Ubuntu 10.10 install has no kernels in its /boot/?
 cws: Does that partition still exist? Are you still using it as the /boot/ for Ubuntu 10.10?
 cws: Yes.
 cws: Why do you have a separate /boot/ partition in the first place?
 cws: Separate /boot partitions are only needed in specific circumstances.
 !ot | rcmaehl

 PresuntoRJ: Do you have more than one hard drive?
 PresuntoRJ: Your BIOS probably just isn't booting from the drive grub is installed to. Try changing the boot order in the BIOS.
 PresuntoRJ: It wouldn't. If that is what is happening then it would most likely be a coincidence.
 PresuntoRJ: Can you run boot info script as explained here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1291280 and pastebin the RESULTS.txt?
 PresuntoRJ: You can run boot info script from a LiveCD.
 PresuntoRJ: I'm almost certain that your BIOS is booting from either sdb or sdc.
 PresuntoRJ: It could be that the drive is taking long enough to be ready that it's thinking it's not there. Also be sure you're not going by drive enumeration. Drive numbering can change and may not match the way that linux numbers them.
 PresuntoRJ: Do you have an option for a one time boot menu?
 PresuntoRJ: Your fstab doesn't matter if your BIOS is loading the mbr of the wrong drive.
 PresuntoRJ: Most BIOSs have an option to "Press F8 for a one time boot menu" (where F8 is just an example, the exact key is different for every BIOS). This will bring up a menu listing your drives and allow you to chose which drive to boot.

 PresuntoRJ: Also try holding shift during boot.
 spirals: bash-completion

 PresuntoRJ: The grub loading tells a lot. I forgot that Ubuntu disables that as well unless you're holding shift. Yes, it coould be that grub is trying to set the resolution too high. If you follow the guide I linked to and uncomment GRUB_TERMINAL=console in /etc/default/grub (before running grub-mkconfig) then it should disable the mode setting by grub.

 Juest: Settings for grub2 go in /etc/default/grub (if you decide to use update-grub to keep your grub.cfg updated automatically).
 Juest: What are you trying to accomplish that you can't figure out how to do with grub2?
 Juest: If you're just curious then you'll need to figure it out on your own. I think it's pretty clear by this point that you're not going to get lilo support here.

 pericynthion: Did you install grub to the mbr?
 pericynthion: How did you re-install grub2?
 pericynthion: Do not mark a partition as being a BIOS boot partition unless you want any data on that partition to be destroyed.
 pericynthion: 1: Don't mount the EFI partition at all, we're not dealing with EFI in this case 2: grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/ /dev/sda
 pericynthion: You probably want to create a separate small partition for the BIOS boot partition though so that firmware upgrades still work.
 pericynthion: No.
 pericynthion: The BIOS boot partition does not contain a filesystem, it cannot be mounted.
 pericynthion: Yes.
 nawk: It is a partition where grub's core.img can be embedded on GPT partition tables. On msdos partition tables grub embeds itself between the mbr and first partition. Since no such gap exists with GPT, and since partitions are pretty much free with GPT, a partition is used instead.
 nawk: The important part about the embedding area is that it won't move or be overwritten.
 nawk: You're welcome.
 SinnerNyx: sudo service networking restart
 pericynthion: You're welcome. One last thing though, to be sure upgrades will work in the future can you pastebin the output of "debconf-show grub-pc"?

 johwil: No, but you can try #ubuntu-offtopic.
 Cairo: No.
 johwil: You're welcome.
 nawk: "Installing" grub using the grub shell is grub legacy, and it only ever actually wrote to areas outside any filesystem. GRUB2 always uses grub-install which installs its modules to the directory specified in the --boot-directory= argument, or /boot if no argument is given, and creates a core.img with those modules needed to access /boot/ and embeds it.
 nawk: Your impression was incorrect.
 nawk: No.
 nawk: extN and most other linux filesystems only have one free sector at the beginning, not enough to embed enough code to read said filesystem and load the rest of your code from. Btrfs does have such an embedded area reserved though.
 mathboy2600: XP is still supported. You're saying that it didn't modify your boot.ini during install?
 nawk: Nothing happens when you specify 'root (hdX,Y)', it's 'setup' that actually does the writing. If you don't already have the stage files in /boot/grub/ (on the filesystem specified by 'root (hdX,Y)') then setup will fail.
 nawk: Yes.
 nawk: If it's not using an embedded area, yes.

 m0ksha: Never install grub to a partittion. Always install it to the mbr. If the boot flag makes any difference at all then you haven't installed grub correctly.
 conner_: xrandr won't help, this isn't X.
 conner_: What version of Ubuntu are you using?
 conner_: Then that's probably the highest resolution possible for the ttys while using the proprietary drivers.
 conner_: When using proprietary drivers there is no kernel mode setting support which means among other things that native drivers can't be used for console ttys. VESA instead must be used and since 11.04 tries to use the highest VESA resultion possible by default what you have is probably the best you can get.
 ifqi: Hi.
 conner_: If you're passing 'vga=795' as a kernel parameter, 1: That has been depricated and 2: You might be making the situation worse as a higher resolution may be available but you are overriding it.
 conner_: OK. So to confirm, you are *not* passing any 'vga=' parameter to the kernel?
 MK``: I'm not sure how manageable that would be but are you aware that you can run 32 bit applications, and a full 32 bit chroot if needed, on 64 bit Ubuntu?
 Bonkers: Click on the power icon at the top right.
 Bonkers: That hasn't changed recently.
 !classic | Bonkers
 Bonkers: I'm pretty sure that logout hasn't been in the System menu since before Ubuntu 10.04.
 MK``: I don't know how encrypted home directories would work with such a setup. What is your end goal?
 glacia: Forget what you have downloaded, open Ubuntu Software Center, and search for "game boy"
 MK``: Sharing a user list is not an end goal :)
 Nameless: Do you have hardware that only supports EFI?
 Nameless: That has a BIOS implementation and you'll save yourself headache by using it.
 Nameless: Yes.
 Nameless: Use this iso: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/11.04/release/ubuntu-11.04-desktop-amd64+mac.iso burn it to a CD, boot from the CD, use automatic partitioning in the installer.
 Nameless: And please do just use automatic partitioning rather than trying to setup partitions manually. It will set up everything correctly.
 Nameless: Debian has an IRC channel, #debian, and I answered you in #grub when you asked. Please don't try to get Debian support in #ubuntu.

 YellowGTO: Real time?
 YellowGTO: Then no I don't personally, but it probably exists.
 YellowGTO: If you don't get an answer here try in #ubuntustudio.
 RavenhursT: You used the USB creator that comes on the same image that you wrote to the USB drive?
 RavenhursT: That's really odd because that error is normally from an incompatibility between syslinux versions.
 RavenhursT: And 11.04 comes with syslinux 4.02, not 3.82 as in your error message?
 RavenhursT: That wasn't meant to have a question mark at the end :)
 RavenhursT: Did you make the USB from Windows or from within Ubuntu booted from a burned CD?
 BOBBY_: Don't use wubi. Install a normal dual boot by booting from the Ubuntu install CD and running the installer there.
 BOBBY_: Do you know how to burn a .iso file to a CD?
 BOBBY_: Make another bootable flash drive with Ubuntu and boot from it to install Ubuntu to your hard drive.
 BOBBY_: There are great step by step instructions @ http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download
 BOBBY_: It won't.
 BOBBY_: You're welcome.
 coz_: Yes it can.
 coz_: Unetbootin is named as such because (IIRC) the netboot images (like mini.iso) are particularly easy to boot from USB :)
 Rehan: A normal install is hardware agnostic unless you install proprietary drivers.
 Rehan: If there is enough space just do a normal install to the USB as you would to an internal drive.
 Rehan: Then definitely go with a normal install, any other option would just lead to headache down the road.
 Rehan: Yes, but I prefer to keep support discussion in-channel.
 !grub2 | suigeneris
 suigeneris: Follow the first guide linked there and when you are back in your booted system run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" and select all drives (but no partitions) as install devices for grub.
 Rehan: The easiest thing to do is to burn the iso to a CD or put the installer on a *different* USB drive with startup disk creator.
 Rehan: Only using a virtual machine.
 Rehan: How much RAM do you have?
 Rehan: What is the output of "kvm-ok"?
 Rehan: Yes.
 suigeneris: Did you see my responses?
 Rehan: If you can enable vmx in your BIOS then you can fairly easily do the install within kvm.
 Rehan: No, no GUI (that I know of) for crazy things like this :)
 Rehan: Basically, make *absolutely sure* that the USB drive is not mounted. Make *absolutely sure* you know the correct device name for your USB drive (/dev/sdX, and you want the whole drive, *not* a partition like /dev/sda1).
 Rehan: Then run "gksudo kvm /dev/sdX -cdrom /path/to/ubuntu.iso -boot d -m 2G".
 Rehan: It should bring up a window where you will see the LiveCD start booting. Before you install confirm that the drive you see in the virtual machine looks like the right drive and make *absolutely sure* that the USB drive is not mounted at any point while kvm is running.
 Rehan: Getting any device name wrong could have severe consequences. If this ends up killing your cat it's not my fault :)
 Rehan: Give the virtual machine 2 GiB of RAM rather than the default (I think 512 MiB).
 Rehan: You're welcome.
 lapion: The topic is Ubuntu *support*.
 !ubuntu-desktop | lapion
 teemo: Click and hold the icon you want to re-arrange, then drag (after it pops off the launcher).
 multipass_: Do *not* try to install Adobe reader that way.
 multipass_: Open Ubuntu Software Center and search for Adobe Reader.
 freeman_: That is OK.
 drmorphias: If unity3D is working then you're using the proprietary nvidia drivers.
 w30: Incorrect. glxgears can be runwith the software renderer.
 ray24: Yes. What the drive used to have is of no consequence.
 w30: It runs by default.
 Cporter: Yes it works (not that I recommend RAID 0, especially FakeRAID which you are most likely talking about).
 Joker_77: I would argue that RAID 0 is in many respects much worse than no RAID at all.

 QuikNik: You change settings in /etc/default/grub.
 QuikNik: Since Ubuntu now puts menu entries in a submenu, here is the documentation for specifying an entry within a submenu in /etc/default/grub : http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#default
 QuikNik: You're welcome.
 PatoVW: There is no upgrade option on the live install media. Just use update manager in your booted 10.10 system.
 !upgrade | genjix
 Aren: You're not being ignored. If nobody knows the answer then nobody will answer you.
 genjix: Can you pastebin the contents of  /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades?
 AlexGer: "Zentyal" is not a supported derivitive of Ubuntu. You'll have to get support from them.
 genjix: You're welcome.
 AlexGer: What version of Ubuntu and what was the exact error message from Ubuntu?
 cheapie: What are you trying to install?
 !remaster | Zombiedeadshot
 cheapie: Have you read http://www.skyscrapersim.com/downloads/linux/linux-install.txt ?
 dagon: Press ctrl+alt+F1, ctrl+alt+F7 to get back to X (the GUI).
 cheapie: I'm not particularly interested in going through the steps to install it myself and thus can't really help you much.
 AlexGer: You still haven't told me what version of Ubuntu you are installing and what the exact error message from Ubuntu is.
 anadon: What happens when you try to boot?

 novaria_fajar: http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/why-is-it-free
 novaria_fajar: You can also give the example of Firefox which they are likely to be familiar with.
 botcity: AceKing: sudo is not the solution to every problem and should not be used unless you're sure the command you want to run should be run as root.
 AceKing: Using sudo when you're not sure it's needed is a bad habbit to get into.
 AceKing: You're welcom.
 AceKing: It seems that the file has been successfully unlinked. If you still see history from zeitgeist then try restarting zeitgeist.
 AceKing: In *NIX files aren't actually deleted from the filesystem until there are no applications with an open file handle.
 AceKing: "zeitgeist-daemon --replace &" I believe.
 AceKing: You're welcome.
 AceKing: Is it showing recent documents from before rming .local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite ?
 AceKing: All the guides I see suggest that "rm ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite && zeitgeist-daemon --replace" should do it.
 AceKing: And you still see old history?
 AceKing: Try "rm ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite && mkdir ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite".
 AceKing: Then log out and back in again.
 maxb: If there's a directory there then zeitgeist can't write it's database there. It's a bit ugly but...
 AceKing: No.
 AceKing: Did you log out and back in again?
 AceKing: Shouldn't have to.
 AceKing: What is the output of "ls -ld ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite"?
 AceKing: I am completely confused then.
 xro: Ubuntu will not stop using GNOME.
 xro: GNOME Shell will not be used by default in future versions of Ubuntu, but GNOME is a lot more than just the shell.
 xro: As far as I can tell, yes.
 xro: Best way to find out is probably to try both. You can try GNOME shell from a fedora 15 beta liveCD and Unity from Ubuntu 11.04.
 xro: Have you tried finding a new workflow? Try double clicking on the icon of the app you want to switch to to see all its windows in exposé.
 jamesstanley: device.map is a red harring in this case.
 jamesstanley: What version of Ubuntu?
 jamesstanley: How are you booted currently?
 !classic | xro
 xro: You might also like XFCE in the long run as they (at least for the moment) aren't planning any major overhauls.
 jamesstanley: That is a *very* bad idea and will break grub-install (without warning).
 jamesstanley: By putting a device in /boot/grub/device.map you are stating that said device is a plain device accessible at boot from the BIOS (i.e. not a higher level abstraction like LVM).
 jamesstanley: grub-install will not give any error, but it will produce a core.img which cannot read LVM.
 jamesstanley: Ahh, indeed.
 jamesstanley: I forgot that you had a separate /boot.
 jamesstanley: You're welcome.
 jamesstanley: You may not get the full resolution purple menu at boot since fonts won't be able to be read from LVM, but other than that it should be fine.
 jamesstanley: Please do file a bug report about it (run "ubuntu-bug grub" *without* any device.map so to avoid confusion) though as it is a problem which should be fixed.
 jamesstanley: Sorry, "ubuntu-bug grub-pc"
 jamesstanley: Thanks.
 jamesstanley: Could you subscribe me, "jordanu" to the bug?
 jamesstanley: Or just give me a link?
 jamesstanley: Thanks.
