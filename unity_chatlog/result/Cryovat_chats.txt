 Unity is decent if you're on a single screen with somewhat low resolution
 If you have two screens, the top menu and launcher bar becomes terrible
 Tbh
 Gnome 3 works much better than Unity imo
 ohsix: The general problem is that application switching has turned really inconvenient
 And I hate how they copied the mac menu
 It's terrible
 WOrks on a netbook, but on a full desktop, it just fails
 It's ok if you're using keyboard
 But with a mouse, it's a big hassle
 nutsfornatty: It worked great in Gnome 2 with a panel with a task switcher on each screen
 Gnome 3 also works very nice out of the box for switching apps on multiple screens
 Unity  feels like it's designed without taking high resolutions or multiple screens into account at all
 The solution is pretty easy raelly
 *really
 One launcher per screen
 But the Unity people seem to have a religious issue with that thought
 ohsix: I know, but
 If you're designing a desktop environment for general use across all form factors, then you need to make it scalable
 The Unity team seem like they just ignored scaling at all, and then at the end of the design process realized that someone might be running two screens
 Yeah
 I'm sticking to Gnome 2
 It just works better for my needs
 I just wish the Gnome team wouldn't have been so stubborn in regards to app indicators in Gnome 3
 I'd have been sold on Gnome 3 with appindicators
 Yeah
 It's about time someone tackled it
 Just a shame the Gnome team suffers from not-invented-here syndrome
