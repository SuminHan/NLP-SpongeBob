 hm... this new gnome thing... how do you move the panels or config anything? None of the shortcuts include gnome configuration utilities XD
 so this is a good time to switch to a tiling wm then i guess
 was using awesome + gnome panel now to ease the transition, but that stopped working after upgrade
 so, are there any advantages to the unity dektop thing? I'm trying really hard to think of one. It's like it was meant for tablet PC:s
 aha! the shutoff buttton had a link to the config center... maybe there is hope for gnome yet - they knew exactly where people would look first when they started unity
 @eigba Not a lot, soz. Panels i can't move, huge icon shortcuts and no menu :( and the run command thingy covers 25% of the screen - a bit overkill on 27" screen XD
 ohsix: well there are some panel-like grey strips where panels normally might be... and they hold volume controls and clocks
 is there a way to reach the normal menu from unity?
 yes i did that
 depends, if i want to set up the shortcuts - having the menu handy in some form would problably help?
 wine with pulseaudio patch is good enough for me :P
 lapion, you can switch to ubuntu-classic in gdm as well (just log out) or install some other DE/wm such as kubuntu-desktop
 since unity seems to be the default canonical UI from now on, it might be wise to keep it around
 just click and drag afaik
