 ScreenIssues, you may be better off using the alternate install disk.
 That's a text based installer, it could be that the live disk does not fully support the backlight control on your computer.
 mnoyce, you aren't alone
 greyhatsalafi, Agreed, there is just a total lack of reconfigurability
 jubei1, go ahead.
 greyhatsalafi, I would use crunchbang, but i write software for an office FULL of ubuntu machines
 in fact 2 offices.
 LTSP, the works.
 greyhatsalafi, yeah, i love the way it is going- I just think they might have landed it a bit /too/ early.
 Ruuuumb0, You can install it, but it breaks Unity
 Witchsong, install compiz config settings manager
 I have had to switch to the IFL mirrors
 ipo, what is happening?
 If you open Synaptic package manager, go to repositories in the menu, and then where it says United Kingdom, or wherever, click change, then click other. Then click "select best server" and it will choose the fastest one available.
 Always works when a new release comes out.
 sundjinnkari, gnome 3 breaks unity, I don't know of a way to restore what happens afterwards.
 Samo502, what is the problem?
 Samo502, that's a new one. Have you done a fresh install of Ubuntu or is it an upgrade?
 Ahmuck, it gets installed with Unity
 if you had an NVIDIA driver (proprietary) and installed 11.04, you wont be able to boot. You have to SSH into your machine, wget the nvidia driver and reboot.
 vivid you can't.
 vivid, compiz config settings manager has some basic options
 vivid, tell me about it.
 vivid, sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
 then search for Unity on the left hand side
 you can only change things like hiding and key combinations though
 vivid, you can't do that
 vivid, I saw it in a "Oh they obviously haven't finished it yet" light.
 which begs the question, why give it to users as the default then??
 vivid, tip... in the login screen options, change boot to Ubuntu Classic :)
 johnathan, I think you can use apt-get -f install (or am I completely wrong?)
 truepurple, unlikely, its just your desktop can't load. You have to ssh into your machine and install the graphics driver in text mode.
 johnathan, Solution seems to be detailed in this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1327907
 truepurple, its remote shell (like remote desktop but it gives you a terminal.) sadly, if you don't know what that is, its likely to not be installed, and thus your install could be hosed.
 truepurple, In fact there is one option
 you could put grub into Single User Mode, remove the nvidia driver and see what happens
 truepurple, http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/grub-boot-into-single-user-mode/
 Yes, actually.
 truepurple, worth a try
 truepurple, accept that message, that's fine.
 It should get you into a GUI
 wait
 truepurple, i would recommend installing the latest nvidia driver from the guides on the Ubuntu wiki
 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
 ctrl+alt+del
 I am here
 use up and down keys, truepurple
 truepurple, sorry, assumed you were on NV
 truepurple, the same guide is available for ATI
 ipo, sorry, right. It seems there is either a problem with the machine or the disk if it is not loading past that point
 I would recommend trying to burn another disk (or running the disk check from the pre-boot menu on the disk)
 truepurple, certainly so.
 The problem you are experiencing, truepurple, is the display server cannot load on your card because of an updated kernel.
 ipo, other than burning another disk, and trying a USB boot. I am unsure. How much RAM does the machine in question have?
 truepurple, see pm
 Hello, how do I load the PAE kernel on my machine?
 is it as simple as installing it?
 apparently not in natty, thegoodcushion
 thank you Dr_Willis
 It was the default in 10.
 gnome-system-monitor or free -m
 thegoodcushion, means the PAE kernel is not loaded.
 It should be installed by default, it's odd.
 I am on 24gb ram
 Hello, I have a serious problem with an Ubuntu web server. A permission was changed somewhere, and the resulting problem is that no matter how much I chown files and update permissions- apache2 still says forbidden.
