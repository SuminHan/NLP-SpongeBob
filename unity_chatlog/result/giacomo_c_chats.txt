 i'm having a bit of trouble connecting to my wireless on the live 11.04 cd
 not really sure Erf_Neerg, i know its an intel integrated a/g/b
 i can get it to show me a list of networks, ifconfig says it's up
 yeah, i'm thinking 10.04 might be the way to go hiexpo
 also, this new interface is confusing and kinda a pain
 Erf_Neerg: Network controller:  Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 2915ABG [Calexico2}
 i have no idea what i just did, but i got it to work i guess, haha
 also, what's up with this new interface?  why are they dumbing everything down so much?
 is there a way i can just install xubuntu from the ubuntu live cd?
 i know, but how do i install xubuntu-desktop to my hd from the live cd bazhang
 elijah: just type quit to exit parted
 i guess i'll just install this and then get the xubuntu-desktop
 another question, how do i view my hdd from the live cd?
 i don't remember
 nope
 how do i list the drives i have?
 ah
 fdisk doesn't show it
 but when i go to intall ubuntu, it shows it as /dev/sda
