 Elssha, it's Ubuntu's new shell
 jbwiv, it's a notification
 jbwiv, tells you that something has occurred somewhere. Doesn't actually tell you what occurred just that something has, somewhere, at some point
 jbwiv, you see what I did there
 escott, someone posted it as a bug earlier
 escott, We should have a bet on what actual feature of unity will be the next one to be incorrectly indentified as a bug
 srsbiz, 11.10 is the next lts
 yi`zhi, you can't as far as I'm aware
 mbrochh, I'm having trouble enjoying it full stop
 webtrickster, there is a guide on the official forums to adding the gnome 3 ppa if you wish to
 webtrickster, however be aware if you proceed with gnome 3 you cannot roll back to unity or gnome 2
 webtrickster, goto the forums and do a search for 'gnome 3 ppa'
 webtrickster, if you are struggling to use the forums you really shouldn't consider moving to gnome 3
 webtrickster, not at the moment although suse has it in its repositories
 shaneo_, you will have to reinstall
 shaneo_, you know that whole warning about not being able to roll back changes made when you enable the ppa, they weren't joking
 mordof, I had the same issue yesterday with xchat
 mordof, icon dissapears and can only open it with alt-tab. Report it as a bug
 mordof, Only fix I found was to restart unity
 mordof : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs
 mordof : read that, it's pretty straight forward
 mordof, I just logged out and back in
 mordof, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xchat-gnome/+bug/772524
 mordof, does that sound familiar?
 lehel_, you can't
 Halt, make sure there are no spaces between the channels i.e. should be #ubuntu,#ubuntu-uk
 xs3ns3, login to ubuntu classic if you wish to go back to gnome 2 desktop
 xs3ns3, logout then log back in and double check that ubuntu classic is selected otherwise it will throw you into 2d unity as I am aware
 jack123 : if you wish to go back to single windows boot, boot from your windows cd and choose to boot into dos recovery and type fixmbr, that should do the trick
 daxroc, unity is a shell for gnome 2, gnome-shell is a shell for gnome 3
 xs3ns3, no problem
 xs3ns3, they don't exactly make it obvious
 daxroc, it's nothing like gnome-shell
 daxroc, I'm using gnome 3 and gnome-shell from the ppa here
 daxroc, imo, and this is my opinion, unity isn't fit to lace gnome 3's rather lovely shoes
