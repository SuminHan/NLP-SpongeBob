 Hi all
 The new Natty interface seems pretty cool! I wonder if there are any tutorials for how I can find my way through it more easily..?
 beta____, I can understand why you might wanna do that. :\
 tensorpudding, how do I add more workspaces?
 Hi all
 how do I configure compiz without having to switch to the old interface?
 Where do I find the new Application Panels Indicators/
 ?
 Hello?
 KM0201, how do I use the panel-indicators?
 KM0201, where do I find them?
 KM0201, oh, I see. That's quite disappointing if you ask me. Thanks though.
 KM0201, how do I add them to the indicator?
 KM0201, no need to add anything at all?
 KM0201, It's not about the indicator-applets themselves. What actually disappointing is having to add them from Synaptic (or the terminal).
 KM0201, thanks to this issue alone, I assure you that quite many of those who interested in Ubuntu will walk away from just because of that.
 KM0201, I think I might do the same. :\
 KM0201, Yeah,
 I'm switching back to gnome.
 So how do I switch back to Gnome.
 Hi all
 Why removing compizconfig-settings-manager from the repositories??! :S
 DingGGu, Trust me dude. No offense to the Ubuntu team but 11.04 simply sucks. Big time. -_-
 trism, When I tried to install simple-ccsm, it said there are some unmet dependencies. That was one of them.
 trism, It's already installed??
 trism, Oh I see.
 trism, it seems like everything is broken at the moment. The whole Ubuntu system is broken at the moment. :P
 Hi all.
 I'm having this weird problem with changing the keyboard lay-out. I use the the Alt-Shift combination to change the layout. I can change it from USA to Arabic (the second language), but when I try to change it back it doesn't work unless I do that manually with the mouse. How do I fix that?
 _genuser_, FF4 is awesome if you ask me?
 ahh, ignore the question mark..
 htek, Exactly.
 So can anybody please help me with me layout problem?
 I can change my layout from English to the other language using the keyboard, but I can't change it back unless I do it with the mouse. What could be the problem?
