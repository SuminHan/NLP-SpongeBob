 I'm trying to run a terminal command from a launcher on Maverick, yet when I run the launcher it just doesn't do anything.
 Yet the command I used, works perfectly in the terminal.
 Why does it not work from the launcher?
 Jordna_U: "java -Xmx1024m -Xms512m -cp ~/Downloads/minecraft.jar net.minecraft.LauncherFrame"
 Without quotes, of course.
 Ah.
 Alright, thanks.
 Alright.
 freeman_: Care to give me a link to where I'd report it? :P
 freeman_: I'll let you know when it loads :P
 freeman_: Hah. :P
