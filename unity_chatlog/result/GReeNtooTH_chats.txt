 11.04 is not stable and is still under development
 oh sorry my mistake
 your connecting to wpa/wpa2 doesnt use hex psk
 startx
 try passphrase 1st 1 down
 blz is it wpa
 you cant connect wpa from term use wicd or ndiswrapper
 go to wpa supplicant 1st 1 down then enter phrase
 wicd alot better
 instead of psk go to passphrase should work no problem
 edit your "wpa_supplicant.conf" then retry
 blz thats all correct
 correct blz
 sudo ifconfig wlan0 up &&iwconfig wlan0 essid (essid) key (psk)
 try like ive put sudo ifconfig wlan0 up && iwconfig wlan0 essid (essid) key (psk)
 iwpriv wlan0 set AuthMode=WPA2PSK
 yes
 sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
 replace the lot with this
 auto wlan0
 iface wlan0 inet dhcp
 how you do that new to this
 got it
 http://paste.ubuntu.com/602494/
 no then run dhclient wlan0
 sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
 sudo dhclient wlan0
 hex
 blz this first sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
 ifconfig wlan0 up
 what card you got
 check your additional driver and install
