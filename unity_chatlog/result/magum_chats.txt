 hi @all
 could somebody please tell me how I can close my gnome session and go to the login screen from the console?
 I am stuck in a gnome session without title or side bar...
 killing the x session... that is an idea
 I'll try it!
 back
 thx for the tips
 ... restart gdm did not work, but killing Xorg was fine
