 LAcan:  sorry for disconnection
 LAcan:  so how to fix boot records
 LAcan: yes
 LAcan:  Yes i get it till the time i dont start windows, the moment i did,  on next restart i face this problem
 LAcan:  yes first three were related to ubuntu and fourth was for windows 7
 LAcan:  EXACTLY, you got the point
 LAcan:  really it is
 LAcan:  i am on windows
 escott:  yes
 LAcan:  After problem i put Live CD in and reinstalled ubuntu, that repaired bootloader, then booted to windows deleted the drives of ubuntu and used mbr repair utility to clear all ubuntu records
 escott:  yes i have two drives on same HDD, but dont know where grub went
 LAcan: used the same one
 escott:  yes
 LAcan:  so you want to say i should boot windows after installing ubuntu then go to widows boot.ini and add a ubuntu record there
 LAcan: okay i would do that, but tell me one thing will it also make that location primary to check first for OS's
 LAcan: okay  i am gonna try it with 110.04 today, will you be on irc tommarow
 **11.04
 LAcan:  this time dont have any Ubuntu installed
 escott:  yes had tried it and no boot menu had appeared.
 okay i will create a video of the same problem  and upload it to youtube on my channel. please have a look of it
 escott:  LAcan  intrestingly if i install ubuntu using option "Install inside windows" i am able to use both as fine as two windows
 escott:  in the end i had given it a try
 escott:  but all those errors arrived when i install as full using live cd
 escott:  i think what LAcan  has suggested is gonna work. But will you guys be here tommarow
 so if i have to add entries of ubuntu using EasyBCD i get three options of drives what i do one is swap dive other is home and third is root. any suggestions please?
