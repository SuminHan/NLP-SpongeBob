 Hi, I just installed Ubuntu 11.04 except when I tried to boot into it I got given an error message saying that my hardware isn't supported and that I'll be shown the classic environment. I have an ATI 5850 graphics card with the latest FGLRX drivers installed so I'm not sure why it's causing this. Anyone have any ideas?
 Upgrade
 unity_support_test gave  No such file or directory
 I just did a standard upgrade :S
 But it looks like unity-common wasn't installed...
 incarus6, yes
 vibhav, unity is saying my hardware isn't installed
 vibhav, sorry tired. *compatible
 incarus6, hopefully. Don't see how my hardware isn't compatible since I only bought the graphics card last year (ATI 5850)
 vibhav, 5850 ATI
 vibhav, It seems that you do not have the hardware required to run Unity. Please choose Ubuntu Classic at the login screen and you will be using the traditional environment.
 vibhav, 1GB. it's a mid/upper end graphics card
