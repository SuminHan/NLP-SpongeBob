 benji_: someone more competant than me could probably knock together a bash function to do that
 benji_: i'll givce it a go
 benji_: uname --machine | grep i686 >/dev/null && echo "Your one a 32 bit machine" || echo "Your on a 64 bit machine"
 i think that works
 no problem
 i rarely get to test my (limited) bash skills
 'lo everyone, anyone know how i can reorder items in the unity side bar. nothing i try does anything...
