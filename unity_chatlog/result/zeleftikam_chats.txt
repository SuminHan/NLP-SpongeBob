 New 10.10 install on Gigabyte GA-G31M-ES2L with Realtek audio. No sound. Tried installing Linux drivers from Realtek; rebooted. No sound. Help?
 acicula: ?
 acicula: yes
 acicula: some thing linked from google. i have no idea how to remove the Realtek drivers. I ran an install script it included that installed about a billion things, and there doesn't appear to be a removal script included. suggestions?
 acicula: wipe the entire ubuntu installation i just put on??
 acicula: i believe it's a Realtek ALC883 or 888, integrated onto a Gigabyte GA-G31M-ES2L motherboard. the chip is too tiny to read the exact model
 acicula: 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 01)
 acicula: the motherboard has a realtek ALC chip on it...
 acicula: sure

 acicula: i know. but google Gigabyte GA-G31M-ES2L and you'll see loads of information about the Realtek ALC88x audio chip on it
 acicula: yes
 acicula: the Realtek crab and everything
 acicula: i don't recall a BIOS option for disabling the on-board audio
 acicula: could this motherboard be bad? come to think of it, i have NEVER been able to get sound to work on it. I am installing Ubuntu because i couldn't get sound to work on it under Mac OS X 10.6.7
 escott: no audio at all
 acicula: i don't know anything about that stuff. i was told Ubuntu was easy :(
 escott: ^
 the alsa site is broken anyway, i can't download the driver or tools
 oh well i guess i'll buy a Mac
 bye bye
 acicula: i'm looking at the motherboard, it says Realtek ALC888B
 escott: what do i need that for? i can look right at the chip and tell you it says Realtek ALC888B
 escott: it doesn't matter, the alsa ftp site is malfunctioning so i can't get it anyway
