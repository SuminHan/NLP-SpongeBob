 hello, Is there something like df in terminal? I wish to see a statistic of space used for / , /home , / etc , /usr etc.
 uhm, df dose not show how mutch space is used in /etc or /usr
 df -disck free
 it is okay in terminal, a gui it is nicer trough
 js__,  is a joke
 I'm not amazed by unity either
 !cc verify 3264378345
 :))
 !ccroute 423056346740
 =))
 dose channel's with cc exist anymore in these times?
 js__, logout and from the longin screen you can switch to ubuntu classic
 bullgard4, irc credit card channel
 there you can verify the cc, route to bank, pin number, email password and dirty h0ax like that
