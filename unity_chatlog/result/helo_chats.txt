 i'm going to be introducing a non-computer person to ubuntu... should i put them on unity?
 Adis45: a new linux MMORPG
 shhhh!
 macrossm: you can just use the other desktop interface...
 macrossm: you don't have to use unity with 11.04
 is there any way to switch the handedness of unity?
 i.e.- dash on the right instead of left
 uofm49426: debian is a great distro
 is the proper way to add/remove indicators in unity to add/remove their packages in the package manager? i.e.- if an indicator is installed, it is automatically enabled?
 nothingspecial: aww... i was hoping the default would be to enable all installed indicators, since the UI doesn't provide a method to enable/disable them
 it would make sense
 i have a relatively old setup with 1GB, athlon 64 4000+, and geforce 6700 video, and unity runs great
 anyone know if banshee can upload music to zune devices?
