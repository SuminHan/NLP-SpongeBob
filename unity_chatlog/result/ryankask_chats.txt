 I am trying to boot 11.04 live cd and i see this: http://www2.ryankaskel.com/misc/images/screenshots/natty-startup.jpg
 usr13: realistically.. i mean 10.10 runs fine but i can't even boot 11.04... any tips?
 usr13: it's just a bunch of colored lines. it looks like it's a driver issue but i don't know.
 i can't boot the live 11.04  CD without having a flickering screen with all sorts of colored lines... should i try to upgrade from 10.10 and debug from there? were there any many changes to hardware support in 11.04?
 is there any way to inspect graphics card issues from the natty live cd?
 i.e. abort x
 ohsix:  i'm not getting a black screen i'm getting a flicekring screen
 ohsix: very hard to see but http://www2.ryankaskel.com/misc/images/screenshots/natty-startup.jpg
 ohsix: basically i'm running 10.10 fine and i don't see why i can't boot into it. should i just try upgrading? or can i debug like i could if i upgraded from the live CD?
 ohsix: it's on board intel and nvidia
 ohsix: where should i report that?
 ohsix: and should i cancel my upgrade of natty until it's fixed
 ohsix: hmm i believe i use edgers on 1.10 now... where should i report this?
 ohsix: if I use edgers now will it upgrading to natty downgrade it?
 ohsix: ok I've backed everything up I'm just going to give it a go
 ohsix: where should i report this to?
 ohsix: it's _very_ blurry but yes i can see text in the screen
