 I'm having problems with XChat and Unities app bar. It keeps opening up new copies instead of bringing the current running instance of xchat up to the front
 Im having problems with xchat + unity bar, it keeps launching new copies instead of bringing the existing one to the front
 Is anyone else having problems with xchat + unity bar? XChat doesnt even show up at all
 Is there a channel for Unity?
