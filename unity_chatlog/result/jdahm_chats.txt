 does the ubuntu installer support pre-configured mdadm raid arrays?
 sam-_-: because gnome3 is not better than unity
 why is 11.04 LTS a different install option from 11.04?
 ActionParsnip: oh, sorry, read it wrong
 that is 10.04 still
 I love how the community page recommends 64 bit but the main download page recommends 32 bit
 why doesn't ubuntu push bittorrents more?
 it is far easier to download
 LjL: I don't see it on the main page.  I had to go to "alternative downloads".  Is that right?
 LjL: I'm dlownloading it via torrent now
 LjL: I'm probably switching to
 LjL: eh sorry one sec
 LjL: I'm probably switching to ubuntu because everyone at work runs it :P  (instead of arch)
 LjL: what do you mean?
 LjL: see it.  Thanks
 I'm trying to modprobe mdadm, but it doesn't seem to be included on the liveCD (to install).  Is it included or do I have to get the actual installation cd?
 or use grml to preconfigure my drives?
 am I gauranteed that /sbin/mdadm will start after installing or do I need to chroot and add it somehow?
 I was almost at the installation process using the LiveCD but it crashed so I force quitted the installation app.  Now when I click on "Install Ubuntu 11.04" it doesn't bring up any dialog
 is there any other way to start it?
 I already have RAID set up from a previous installation, but it thinks /dev/md0 and /dev/md1 are entire devices, not just partitions
 escott: hmm it seems like if I manually format the device with mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0 it lets me use it as a "partition"
 weird
 escott: what if I want it to just use the entire device without repartitioning it?
 escott: I guess I'll just do it my manual way.  Seems hacky however.  In any case I have to wait for mdadm to sync these drives in /dev/md1
 escott: what is degraded mode?
 escott: oh, eww, nah I'll do it this way.  Thanks for the tip anyway
 escott: ok I will after I get lunch. /dev/md1 is going to take about another hour to sync ;)
 escott: maybe I'll submit a big report about it
 escott: I know.  I'm goign to need to chroot when I'm done installing and make sure everything is go inside the install
 escott: it's not goign to be nice
 /away lunch
 oops
 escott: ok back
 I'm getting an error: "ERROR: modinfo: could not find module nvidia_current"  And then the installer seems to have stopped, but nothing has crashed
 is this something I should just wait for or try again?
 dotblank: ok, but I'm just installing 11.04.  Why would it expect that I have it
 dotblank: thats sort of what I expected but how can I make it continue and not worry about that?
 dotblank: I'm still on the livecd installing...
 dotblank: it's not even done installing
 dotblank: it's just sitting there
 dotblank: no, it seems to have stopped.  At least no other output is generated after that
 dotblank: nvidia tesla
 dotblank: it's a current nvidia card
 dotblank: it's a modern nvidia card.  It's something like a GTX495 or something
 dotblank: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation GF108 [GeForce GT 430] (rev a1)
 dotblank: oh, it seems to have continued now
 dotblank: ok it's done installing now.  Now I have to deal with adding mdadm to the startup modules and then I should be OK.  I'll keep you posted on what happens after I restart
 escott: so I used raid to install and I'm all done.  I installed mdadm in the chroot.  Do I need to copy over the mdadm.conf file?
 escott: looks like it already created one for me
 escott: ok rebooting.  Wish me luck!
 escott: ok I get a grub error 16
 grrr
 escott: it points to /dev/sda on which /dev/sda1 (/boot) is, which is not part of the raid array
 escott: I have boot on a separate partition
 escott: ok so I'm mounting stuff here again and I'm going to look around
 escott: hopefully with your help I can find whats wrong
 escott: I'm using raid5 for both / and /home (different arrays)
 escott: yeah I'm confused to.. It's all mounted now.  Where is the first place to look?
 escott: no, maybe I need to rebuild one...
 escott: I come from archlinux, but I haven't ever dealt with initrds,  tried to always build my own kernels without them
 escott: it should have at least shown the grub screen and the boot options if it sensed /dev/sda1 the boot partiiton
 escott: I think ti's something more fundamental than that
 escott: well it HAS grub, and /dev/sda1 is definitely bootable...
 escott: I'm still thinkin what it could be
 escott: yeah, and sys and proc and so forth
 escott: I'm used to doing this ;)
 escott: you know what I think it might be. I didn't have /dev/sda1 mounted to /mydrive/boot when I chrooted and installed mdadm
 escott: I'll redo grub anyway as well
 escott: ok I rebuilt the initrd, reinstalled mdadm, and reinstalled grub with the line: set root='(/dev/sda,msdos1)'
 escott: anything else you can think of?
 escott: no, as long as /dev/sda1 is bootable, you should ALWAYS install grub to the root of the drive, (at least thats what I've always beentold)
 escott: just doubled checked and /dev/sda1 is bootable
 escott: I'm going to triple check the UUIDs in /etc/fstab as well
 escott: ok those look correct as well
 escott: ok rebooting
 escott: ok still the same error
 grr!
 escott: now I'm sure that it's with grub
 escott: it almost looks like grub1 is loading
 escott: not grub2
 escott: thats what makes me kinda confused
 escott: it has a larger font and no background behind grub
 escott: at least when I upgraded to grub2 on my arch box I saw that change
 escott: it doesn't show anything, just says grub and then error 16"
 escott: can I clear out the MBR of other drives?
 just to be sure?
 escott: do you know the command for that?
 escott: so heres something.  When I do "apt-get install grub2" it wants to remove some grub packages and install "grub2"
 escott: are you sure it by default has grub2??
 escott: ok I have grub-install (GRUB) 1.99~rc1-13ubuntu3
 escott: yep.  Ok back to debugging this.  everything is mounted and I'm chroot'd
 escott: wait the CURRENT grub seems to be grub-pc, right?
 escott: what is grub2 then?  I want to reinstall it
 escott: ok trying again...
 escott: it works!
 escott: thanks for all your help!
 escott: also: I very much like the new interface.  I don't know why people are complaining
 escott: I think so
 escott: you were on the ball with your suggestion
 gogeta: I like the interface.  Linux needs better interfaces.  This is one organizations take on it
 gogeta: beats the hell out of gnome3
 gogeta: at first I switched to KDE when gnome3 came out and gnome2 sucked, but KDE is worse than all these new interfaces (combined?) ha
 escott: for fun: http://pastie.org/1845281
 zetheroo: how so?
 escott: I like it :)  It's for computational physics simulations
 Drumm96: clean installs always work better than upgrades
 Drumm96: if you upgrade, be used to having headaches
 Drumm96: yofel just from experience, I have had to fix way too many friends' upgraded installations
 yofel: most of the time it's because GPG keys were somehow deleted for PPA's
 ok well I should head out
 can I get focus follows mouse in unity?
 can I create a dock "launcher" entry for applications that don't show up under "applications"?
 I have some applications that aren't installed through apt that I would like to inclue in my dock on unity.  Can I add them?  How do I add them?
 ActionParsnip: how do you make a launcher?
 ActionParsnip: ok I added it in alacarte
 ActionParsnip: it's still not in the applications menu in unity
 ActionParsnip: seems to not work for this app
 ActionParsnip: when I click on the icon I made, it pulses for a second and then nothing shows up and it stops pulsing
 exfileme: umm? how so?
 when I go to google.com in firefox on 11.04 it defaults to a really weird language with some really really weird character set
 it has something like ?hl=chr
 no clue what language that is.  Anyone fixed that?
 who is the idiot that packages firefox on ubuntu?
 iggyology: install more?
 iggyology: to fix icons, just remove and reinstall packages
 usually that fixes things
