 All
 I am new to the IRC channel
 I have a few questions about ubuntu server edition
 who do I address the questions to?
 does ubuntu support dual-Xeon (each 4 core) server grade machine?
 @bullgard4, how do I confirm that?
 @bullgard4, I am planning to buy a server for building Android apps for my organization. So, I can go with the Kernel version that supports.
 bullgard4, Is there some documentation on which HW is supported ?
 marenostrum, thanks for the link
 bullgard4, sure, I will try to get more specific details
 bullgard4, I just want to make sure that we can make sure of the full potential of the Xeon (super expensive) server
 marenostrum, yes it was helpful
 marenostrum, I need to go back and get specific details of the hardware to ask more specific question, I guess.
 marenostrum, yes that looks a good idea
 I will go there and check out the details
 marenostrum, I am there right now and will post a question right away
