 so, just upgraded to natty on my laptop, and i can't seem to activate nvidia drivers for acceleration anymore...
 apparently, jockey(?) says the drivers are installed, but not activated. but my x log says direct rendering is yes. and nvidia settings says everything is a-ok. glxgears is running, but i can't get unity to load, i just get shunted back to classic 2d
 hm, correction, additional drivers says the nvidia drivers are activated, but not in use... what does that mean?
 and how to "use" them?
 11.04 so far has been less than stellar ... :(
