 Stereocaulon_, well unity wasnt working until i installed proprietary  drivers then it worked then i played in compiz and all got screwed.. so i'm trying to reset it and it's not working :( even classic got screwed :(
 Stereocaulon_, ok.. i'll try it
 Stereocaulon_,  whoa!!! that did the trick.. i was struggling for it since morning.. sudo dpkg-reconfigure unity... thanks a lot
 Stereocaulon_, now the min max button also started glowing when i hover!!
 Stereocaulon_, well i had tried sudo dpkg --configure -a but i didnt help... i learned a new command today dpkg-reconfigure!!

 ikonia, i'm having problems with nspluginwrapper so i was thinking of removing it... what should i do?
 Sledge, flash didnt get install due to errors from nspluginwrapper so i installed it manually..
 Sledge, yes but 64bit
 ikonia, i'm unsure whether am i using 32bit or 64bit java.. that's why i'm not removing it
 Sledge, so is flash working now?
 Sledge, i just copied that .so file to /usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so and it worked

 what to use for onscreen system monitoring? the applet which we had in panel in Ubuntu 10.10 and below
 thanks IdleOne
 Sledge,  sudo dpkg-reconfigure unity
 Sledge, on which screen are you on? virtual terminal?
 Sledge, ctrl+alt+f7
 Sledge, did you get Login screen?
 Sledge, GUI Login Screen?
 Sledge, you have to execute that command on ctrl+alt+f1 i.e. virtual terminal then reboot and try loging in
 rgr does Sledge has to execute that compiz --replace command?
 Sledge, try changing to classic then switch to Unity again
 Sledge, well that's strange!!
 Sledge, reinstall unity and ccsm
 Sledge, sudo apt-get purge unity ccsm
 Sledge, then sudo apt-get install unity ccsm
 Sledge, sudo ap-get install simple-ccsm
 Sledge, sorry it's compizconfig-settings-manager
 Sledge, sudo apt-get purge compiz acompizconfig-settings-manager and then sudo apt-get install compiz  compizconfig-settings-manager
 Sledge, great!
