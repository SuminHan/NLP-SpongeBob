 Is it possible to install Ubuntu inside VMWare ESXi? I am getting an error it cant mount the CDROM
 Logan_: No. I install VMWare ESXi Hypervisor on the server, then I create a virtual machine to which I want to install Ubuntu
 When I boot the Ubuntu CD inside the virtual machine I get the message "(initramfs) mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on //filesystem.squashfs failed:
 How can I download .torrent of ubutntu? I think the HTTP download is corrupt
 mello, No insults but is this the n00b channel?
 I know what .torrent is, but put into google "ubuntu torrent" and I get this: http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/alternative-download ERROR 404
 If I installed Ubuntu 10.10 it's not going to automatically update to 11.04?
 Is there some user-friendly CLI tool for package management? I'm trying to use aptitude but to find an installed package and remove it seems impossible
 I can't do anything with package management because I always get: ia32-sun-java6-bin : Depends: sun-java6-jre (>= 6.24-1build0.10.10.1) but it is not going to be installed
 And I can't remove ia32-sun-java because of the same issue
