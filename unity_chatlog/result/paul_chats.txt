 hi
 can I sudo-apt get dropbearkey some how?
 I've made a huge big mess of all my public/private keys, if I want to start all over, is it safe to just deleve ~/.ssh ?
 Blue1: clever, thank you
 how does rsync identify two files as the same file and skip it on the next sync, I assume it goes by more than just the fiel name?
 Flashtek: this md5 sounds like a goood deal
 what is the general command for searching a whole drive for word/words
 aha, find is what I'm thinking
