 hi, Ubuntu user here. is this an appropriate channel to ask for help with installing the Perl module XML::LibXML on Ubuntu?
 Arowana: I'm using cpanm, but the problem is the same regardless.
 Arowana: getting this error: "looking for -llibxml2... libxml2 not found"
 Arowana: I've already installed libxml2-dev through apt-get, so I'm surprised it doesn't find it.
 yes.
 sipior: I used 'cpanm', a minimal version of the cpan installer.
 sipior: but the error is not in cpanm, but in the module dependencies.
 ok.
 sipior: hm, but that module is only a means to an end. I really want Test::XML::Valid.
 Arowana: thing is, I always get stuck on this step. generally, I go and ask the Perl people how to do this, but they're often not too sure how to do it on Ubuntu.
 but libxml is almost always a pain to get working the first time.
 sipior: no, but maybe that'll do. I'll try it.
 thank you for your help, Arowana, sipior.
 I'm using 'sudo', yes :)
 Arowana: no. in fact, I thought in Ubuntu there was no user 'root', just sudo.
 Arowana: but maybe I'm wrong on that count.
 ah.
 Pici: :)
