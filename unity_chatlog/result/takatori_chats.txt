 Hi, I was wondering if someone could help me with Unity?
 bindi, Well I just installed it and I don't have it by default.  When I run unity in the terminal I get the error "Cannot register the panel shell: there is one already running"
 When I say "just installed it" I mean Ubuntu 11.04
 trism, is your Unity working by default or did you have to do anything to enable it/
 trism, I have a Nvidia GTS 450 with the latest drivers yet it doesn't start at all.
 Turns out I didn't have the latest drivers for my Graphics card, I managed to get Unity working and I gotta say that I love it.  However, I now can't get Ubuntu to detect my second monitors whereas before it was instant.  Any ideas?
 mitoni, extremely doubtful.
 Anybody got any idea why Ubuntu won't pickup my Webcam's Microphone?  I can't use it for a Skype call for some strange reason, however it detects it fine as a Webcam.
 Well done.
 WhitePride : Speaking on different lines like that is ridiculously annoying.  You can always enable Classic Mode.
