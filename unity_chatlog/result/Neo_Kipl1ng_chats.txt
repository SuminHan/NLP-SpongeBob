 I just updated system by apt-get, and found out its still version 10.10, is 11.40 really released?
 Incarus6: i tried update-manager -d, same thing
 Incarus6: thanks, i will try
 Incarus6: looks like i must do this: edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set Prompt=normal  thanks anyway
 Incarus6: its very good, thank you
 update to 11.40: Need to get 2,199MB of archives. Oh, god! it's too much
