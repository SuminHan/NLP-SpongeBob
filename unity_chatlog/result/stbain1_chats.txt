 teddyroosebelt, yah, me too (both laptop and desktop). Had to blow one away... trying to salvage the other now.
 anyone else running a Broadcom wireless having trouble getting it going (even w/ proprietary firmware driver)?
 lsheeba, if you do that... make sure you have everything backed up. Update manager bricked both of my computers. Have the CD downloaded and burnt in case you have to re-install from scratch.
 ohsix, just about everything on both of my systems was default
 lsheeba, yes, if you have Grub running already, you should be able to fall back to that
 freeman_, try unrar
 lsheeba, you're welcome
 OK, I almost have my desktop restored.... seems to be hung on the "Restoring previously installed packages" part
 Anyone know if I can kill that restoration process?
 upgrade hung... safe to kill the apt-clone restore-new-distro part of ubiquity to see if that frees it up?
 freeman_, how long? Mine's been hung for about 15 minutes now if not longer.
 freeman_, wow... that long, eh?
 crap... still no wirelesws
 broadcom 4311 (STA)
 histo, I have the firmware installed... still doesn't work
 ohsix, I freezed when I did the update through the udpate manager
 ohsix, the install never finished
 ohsix, ended up with black screen... no response, not way to get to console via CTRL+ALT+F1... nada :(
 ohsix, yes.... so then I just slapped in the Natty CD and formatted everything... now Wifi doesn't work even with a fresh install
 usr13, already did that :(
 ohsix, the hardware->additional drivers did all that
 ohsix, trying the raw ndiswrapper instead of the source
 ohsix, I know. sucks, but the "canned" version isn't working... worth a shot
 ohsix, yah.... no clue why mine isn't
 ohsix, but looks like ndiswrapper just saved the day
