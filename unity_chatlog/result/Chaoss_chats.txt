 hey there, I've been trying to get my 2 NTFS hard drives to show up in Ubuntu for the last 19 hours
 they appear in disk utility but i cant find them in explorer
 or what ever its called in ubuntu
 I dont get it they work in windows fine, and i can access them but in ubuntu it doesnt support more than 1 hard drive
 i've so far managed to destroy 4 installations and break a keyboard
 im using the latest version from the website, can someone tell me what 2 do
 both 1TB hard drives are seen in disk manager, but there are no access to them
 i dont see where to acceess
 hmm i seem 2 be getting ignored
 ANYONE HERE KNOW HOW TO ACCESS BOTH OF MY HARD DRIVES, THEY ARE THERE IN DISK MANAGER BUT I CANT FIND THEM IN EXPLORER OR WHAT EVER ITS CALLED, I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR 19 HOURS

 well if im getting ignored im going to shout/spam
 im sure you would
 ok well does anyone know how to fix this problem
 or does linux not support more than 1 hard drive?
 how do i see private messages here?
 ah i see
 I only see 1 drive (folder) thats my main drive
 the other 2 are not there
 ok whats the command, i have sdb1 and sdc1
 and sda1 but thats already working
 what do i have to type in to get them to work
 i could be here another 19 hours, tried fstab mount /dev/sdb1 and unknown command
 would have though after these years they'd have made a way to support more than 1 HD
 what do i have to type into terminal to get the hard drives working, they are sdb1 and sdc1 both are ntfs?

 looking at the fstab page says i need to set up a server
 i dont have the money to buy a server at the moment
 and i dont have the knowledge to compile a new linux distro that supports more than 1 hard drive

 i tried to install pysdm but i cant find it
 and i have spent time looking for it
 i am
 it said it would help me out but its done nothing
 only root can do that
 thats what it says, i've never understood that error
 sudo works sometimes
 yeh i put that in correctly
 now when i try again it just says cannot create directory
 http://paste.ubuntu.com/600598/
 yeh i did
 it just says "Only root can do that"
 which i assume means it cant do it for some reason
 ok
 i see no password entry
 just the message again
 yeh that works it shows me that information
 i put my password in and it showed me, but when i try the command thats suppose dto work, it does not so
 is there no way to brute force access the drives?
 ok i see sdb
 its worked sort of
 i dont see my drive information there
 just a few files (Boot, System volume information, bootmgr etc)
 the folder is only 73Mb free too
 ok
 mount: unknown filesystem type 'promise_fasttrack_raid_member'
 aha i know the problem, ubuntu doesnt support ntfs
 it seems odd because it can access my main windows hard drive (i have one Solid state drive, and 2 1TB hard drives)
 i can seethe solid state drive and the windows folders n stuff
 but the other 2 hard drives are totally 101% inaccessible from ubuntu i've tried so much for so long
 and it always says 1 error, or some other cryptic message
 ubuntu is experminetal lol
 in ubuntu where do you access "system"
 it used to be on the top bar but its vanished
 can someone help me locate this: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/pysdm-graphical-storage-device-manager.html
 i've instlled it but cant find it ANYWHERE what so ever
 i give up with this peice of shit system., cant even put extra hard drives in
