 izinucs: No.
 ruan: GNOME 3 is a project in progress. You can download a GNOME 3 DEB program package from a PPA.
 ruan: Basically by de-installing the associated DEB program package. But it is difficult to deinstall GNOME 2 in Ubuntu because Ubuntu has many metapackages and thus side effects.

 bazhang, tanath Thank you very much for your help.
 Cale: In Ubuntu 11.04, at login, you can select GNOME 2. There you will have the GNOME volume control applet.
 Cale: Just a second.
 Cale: On my Natty system the DEB program package »gnome-media« is installed also.
 Cale: No.
 Cale: What is the reason that you have been forced to recompile the gnome-media package without the pulsaudio stuff in it?
 http://people.ubuntu.com/~nhandler/classroom.html does not show me any entries. Does this mean that there are no Ubuntu classrooms in May, 2011?
 Cale: At the outset you asked: "Is there a convenient PPA or something for adding back the gnome volume control panel applet in 11.04?" My answer now is: You need to fix your PulseAudio first from the ground on. And only after having done so ask for "adding back the gnome volume control applet".
 Cale: I believe that your conviction is wrong. You do not need the PPA in order to re-build your (ALSA) sound system including PulseAudio.
 Cale: Ah! I see. I do not know if such a PPA exists. Sorry.

 gartral: That is a bad idea.
 Andre_Gondim: My workspace is the whole screen. Yours not?
 gartral: Because KDE is a complicated program consisting of many components.
 Andre_Gondim: Right-click on the the icon in the lower right. > Preferences > Number of workspaces > 5.
 gartral: Instaling KDE will not automatically auto-replace gdm. But having installed KDE you cannot simply "switch" back to having no KDE. Because Ubuntu has made too many metapackages. This would mean rather much effort by hand.
 bison: Your apt package system is not all right. Check it.
 bison: Try '~$ update-manager'.
 bison: What do you mean by: "Nothing happens"?
 bison: If you typed '~$ update-manager' and the program Update manager did not appear, then something serious is at fault. Please check your dmesg.

 SeanChambers: On the partition where you or the installer mounted your root. Likely /dev/sda1.
 SeanChambers: In that case I would probably try to re-install Ubuntu anew.
 SeanChambers: I guess that your hardware is at fault or unsuitable. Did you check your hard disk, for example using GPrated? --  It is likely that Ubuntu installs Grub correctly.

 Where can I find the logs of yesterday's ubuntu-classroom lessons?
 !details | Rehan
 boomboorum: You could purge your Gwibber and re-install without theFacebook plugin first. See if that works.
 boomboorum: to purge - to completely remove (the package, using for example Synaptic). Ok?
 Rehan: Try to use System > Administration > Startup Disk Creator
 Rehan: There is. But I do not know any details.
 Rehan: One dd command alone is not enough.
 Rehan: That means that you will have to do more operations than one dd command. Because the data on an USB stick is organized differently from a hard disk partition.
 Where can I find the logs of yesterday's ubuntu-classroom lessons?
 foodstamp: This refers to the year 2006. What I am asking for is logs of yesterday's classes.
 freakynl: My /var/log/messages has been filled the last time on Mar 17, 2011. (*surprise*)

 red I do not know what you refer to. I am lost.

 js__: What desktop do you use? Did you analyze /var/log/syslog at this event time?
 js__: By "desktop" I mean your graphical user interface. For example GNOME 2, Unity, KDE, etc.
 js__: The default graphical user interface of Ubuntu 11.04 is "Unity". Do you see a few icons to the right of your screen image?
 js__: I made a mistake. I meant "to the left". --  So you are using "Unity" as your graphical user interface.
 js__: Yes. --  I cannot help you as I do not use Unity myself. --  Good luck with Ubuntu!
 js__: I have read that such an error occurs with Unity. But I do not know how to fix it.
 js__: I would recommend that you switch to Ubuntu Classic view. Ubuntu Classic View does not have many errors.
 wolfy_: What is a "channel with cc"?
 js__: It is not complicated: You will have to quit (or "terminate") Unity. Then start anew. When you are prompted for your login name and your logon password, you will find at the bottom at about the middle a menu which has a menu item "Ubuntu Classic". Press on it.
