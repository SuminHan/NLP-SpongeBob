 hey guys, i've got a little question: i've just installed 11.04, logged into ubuntu-classic by default, installed nvidia-current (i'm using geforce 6150 on a desktop), rebooted, but it's still running ubuntu-classic by default, even if i select just ubuntu from gdm login screen, any idea? i wanna try out unity!
 jerriy: do 'sudo passwd user'
 dustin_: isn't the 'ubuntu' session the unity one?
 jerriy: sorry for that, i just caught up in the middle of the conversation
 dustin_: i keep selecting the session 'ubunt' but still it runs gnome 2.3.x
 the last option says something about "user defined session", but i really don't know how to set that up
 KM0201: i've just installed nvidia-current, and running glxgears works fine
 dammit, if anybody talked to me, please repeat it because i closed irc unintentionally
 escott: what's the line i got to usually grep in glxinfo to see if i got acceleration?
 it puts out a lot of info :P
 oh there i go
 leo@orleans:~$ glxinfo | grep render
 direct rendering: Yes
 escott: render YES, vendor NVIDIA
 escott: dustin_ any idea :\? it seems i got 3d acceleration, and choosing the right session
 dustin_: don't take such a work if it's not necessary
 escott: right
 escott: dustin_ i just created a new user and tried to load unity and said something like "you don't have the necessary hardware to run unity, select ubuntu-classic from the login screen'
 escott: not actually, don't know really well what unity is based upon
 escott: dustin_ it's a geforce 6150, integrated
 drivers seem to be installed ok
 dustin_: what do you mean by checking? i installed 11.04 from stracth, then installed nvidia-current package
 dustin_: i think they are
 dustin_: i will not make much of a trouble of it...i just wanted to try it but then install gnome 3 any way :P
 dustin_: good luck with that :P
 what's the best way to install gnome3 in ubuntu 11.04 guys :P?
 let's break everything! wohoo!
