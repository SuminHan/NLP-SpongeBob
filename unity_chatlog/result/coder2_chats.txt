 Hello. Could anyone help me with alsamixer. It does start, just writing:  Mixer load hw:0 error: Invalid argument
 bulgard4: how to do it?
 sorry, bullgard4, how to reinstall mixer only
 bullgard4: I had to install lucid on other mobo, then returned my mobo back. Sound works, but i cannot control volume
 bullgard4: I do not have gnome at all. It is console-only system
 bullgard4:  how about alsamixer? No GUI, no gnome
 bullgard4, so why I should install "gnome-alsamixer" instead of just alsamixer?
 Dr_Willis, Yes, I need console-only, but it do not start
 bullgard4, sorry, I've mentioned that my system is console-only
 Dr Willis, bullgard4: replacing of motherboard caused problems with network and sound. I've fixed network, but i do not know how to fix sound
 bullgard4: before I try to reinstall alsa-utils, please advise how to backup the system easily? It is very painful to reinstall the whole OS on this hardware, because 10.04 do not install on it and I need to install the OS on other motherboard and then return my again
 Ok, thank you, bullgard4 and Dr_Willis. Bye.
