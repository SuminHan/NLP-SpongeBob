 I just installed ubuntu 11.04 on my new ideapad u160 i5 with internal intel hd grafik card. Unfortunately, when I switch the screen settings with the screen dialog, my display goes black and never recovers :( And ideas?
 Oh Yes: I googeld for 4 hour now :(
 nemo: here i have the same problem
 i dont know what metacity is, but i switched the startup screen to classic with no effects
 Wow. There is an update already. I will try it ....
 THX
 hi nemo still does not work. :(
 Looks like the intel hd chip is not working correctly :(
 Any ideas, why the screen stays black after switching monitors on my intel hd chip based notebook
