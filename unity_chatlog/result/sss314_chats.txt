 How do I check last-modified date with command line?
 Fuchs, thanks
 Is there anything I should know before upgrading Ubuntu Desktop 10.10 to 11.04 (Upgrade button in Update Manager)? And, do I need to burn a LiveCD?
 Halzen, Don't do what? burn a LiveCD?
 stefg, I want to upgrade my 10.10 into 11.04
 Halzen, Is there anyway I can keep my files when installing from a new burned LiveCD?
 iceroot, Halzen recommended a fresh install, what do you think?
 Halzen, stefg, iceroot, LjL, I'll backup my files, but if Ubuntu's default upgrade will work would it be OK? or should I make a fresh install anyway?
 I think I'll first use 11.04 as a LiveCD to check out the new version
 Does 11.04 work as fast(or slow) as 10.10?
 Is the only difference between Ubuntu and Xubuntu is the GUI?
 Halzen, ok, maybe I'll install Xubuntu
 How can I make a Start Up USB with non-Ubuntu ISO?
 How can I make non-Ubutntu bootable CD?
 How do I burn non-Ubuntu ISO images to USB stick?
 Abhijit, ok I'll try that
