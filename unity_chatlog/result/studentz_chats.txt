 Help  Ubuntu Natty Nvidia driver activated but no currently in use ??
 soothsayer I have huge screen resolution I cannot ignore it :(
 Soothsayer it says " you dont appear to be using the Nvidia X driver"
 Soothsayer "run nvidia-xconfig asd root" I should do that??
 Soothsayer I used Jockey and It did not work
 I did and It shows That I should run nvidia-xconfig
 Soothsayer I did and It shows that I should run "nvidia-xconfig"
 Soothsayer I did it twice and no solution
 Soothsayer Yep
 Soothsayer also I run nvidia-xconfig and I got stock after grub. So I restarted as a single mode

 Hi there.  It is possible to hide the top panel in Unity
 engamalsko Hi. Nothing Happen with the right click, but I do not want to delete it just hide it. In the same way I can Hide the Launcher
 engamalsko thanks  and enjoy Unity
 AgresiV did you try Unity 2D?
 AgresiV I had 2001 laptop and it works ;)
 AgresiV: you mean to buy another box?
 AgresiV look at this link http://www.webupd8.org/2011/01/unity-2d-qt-now-available-in-ppa-for.html
 AgresiV  good question, I do not have the right answer. But i use the ppa and I had a little problem with the xorg.conf file, which I solved.
 AgresiV Did you fix it?
 AgresiV Please first make a copy of your xorg.conf file and keep it
 AgresiV I mean the one that is working in xubuntu
 AgresiV that  is good enough. Yep
  /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 AgresiV try in a terminal   sudo   find  /  -type f  xorg.conf
 eekTheCat  May be you are right, but we are talking about a specific old hardware, like my laptop from 2001
 AgresiV  Are you in Xubuntu?
 AgresiV  I think you can try it. The driver is usually mesa.
 AgresiV Good luck. I'll be out for a while :)
