 natty will be released when it's ready, same as every other release before it
 tomasz: it's not released until it's announced as officially released.  End of discussion please
 please discuss natty release in #ubuntu-release-party and let people looking for help with ubuntu get help with ubuntu here
 tomasz: it's not a bad site
 stREaKer: when it's ready.  Join #ubuntu-releasy-party
 tomasz: because that's not the final version until it's announced as such.
 stREaKer: yes
 tomasz: no.
 stREaKer: once it's released, update-manager will ask you if you want to upgrade
 tomasz: maybe nothing, maybe something.
 Kage, dreinull_: it's not out until it's announced as out, please stop saying otherwise
 dreinull_: this is not up for discussion.  In any case, the contents of that url may change.
 curt: upgrade your ubuntu version, 9.04 isn't supported anymore
 !9.04 | curt
 BananaLemon: no, you need to have a root account.  But by default, you won't be able to login to the root account.  Your first user will be able to sudo (and anyone else in the admin group).  What exactly do you want to do?
 curt: did you see what I told you?
 Dazzled1: lshw  work?
 phoque_uni: yes, I believe so
 Dazzled1: yeah, sudo just gives you more info (though I'm not sure what exactly)
 curt: use a live cd, that's probably the easiest way for you.  You could even do it with your desktop install cd
 curt: no
 curt: you can access and copy your data when you boot from the desktop cd (it's a live cd so you run the OS right from the cd)
 !backup | DaSMarK
 curt: well if you're saying 9.04 can't access ext4 (which is weird because you should just be able to mount it as ext2), then the easiest thing for you to do is just use the desktop cd
 DaSMarK: read the link ubottu sent you
 !ru | Tatarin
 shadowlemon: when it's ready, as usual
 Join #ubuntu-releasy-party to announce the release of natty.  Let's try to keep this channel usable for people looking for support
 curt: yes, if you already have meerkat installed on a separate partition, that would work too.
 curt: should be fine.  Upgrades have always worked well for me.  But you should have backups just in case
 !printing | thegoodcushion
 thegoodcushion: mine works automatically when I plug it in (some cheap canon s300 (I think)).  Just check those lists and others' experiences before buying
 NetM: because it's not out yet, be patient in #ubuntu-releasy-part :)
 NetM: because it's not out yet, be patient in #ubuntu-releasy-party :)
 AceKing: because it's not out yet, be patient in #ubuntu-releasy-party :)
 pippo: when it's ready, await the announcement in #ubuntu-release-party :)
 curt: lots of unofficial repositories will decrease your likelihood of a smooth experience
 curt: yeah, really it will only matter if you use repositories that affect core packages.   Otherwise, everything should be okay (check release notes of course)
 vibhav: because it's not out yet, be patient in #ubuntu-releasy-party :)
 DJKorbit: if you select it at the login screen, your choice should be remembered
 !java | ^Phantom2^
 vibhav: it's not out yet (probably soon), be patient in #ubuntu-releasy-party :)
 usalabs: it's not out yet (probably soon), be patient in #ubuntu-releasy-party :)
 ^Phantom2^: it is.  In the !partner repositories
 AceKing: :)
 ^Phantom2^: then enable the !partner repositories and install sun java
 DaSMarK: it's not wrong.  But if you want to restore it, you can find a copy in /etc/skel/
 thegoodcushion: if you want mine and are in the boston area, I was about to toss it in the dumpster (it works fine, just don't use it anymore)
 thegoodcushion: ok :)
 !upgrade | Brian911
 Brian911: keep in mind that 11.04 is not released yet, so you'll have to wait a bit
 Brian911: once maverick is released update-manager just pops up and asks you if you want to upgrade :)
 niels1: it's not out yet, be patient in #ubuntu-releasy-party :)
 theGreatDane: on the client
 paranox: please be respectful of others in this channel
 vibhav: #ubuntu-release-party
 vibhav: #ubuntu-ops
 vibhav: you can sort out why you are banned
 paranox: stop telling people they are annoying.  THAT is annoying
 bye*
 burg: use 64bit if you want to, there's no real reason to use 32bit if your computer can use 64bit
 obengdako: 64bit works fine
 eltigre: you have to be more specific
 mythri: can you provide full context?
 eltigre: messages where?
 mythri: ask him to name the software and see if it affects you :)  (there isn't much)
 eltigre: and what's the exact message you receive from apt-get?
 Oday: there's not much use for deborphan nowadays.  That functionality is built into apt-get now
 obengdako: ask him to name the actual software and see if it affects you (there isn't much)
 eltigre: you're trying to upgrade?
 obengdako: I've used 64bit for years, yes
 mythri: I don't follow what you are saying
 eltigre: prefix your command with "LANG=C" and pastebin
 obengdako: hmm, not sure what "run installations for friends" means
 jiltdil: how much ram do you have?
 obengdako: no, you'd have to reinstall
 jiltdil: use 64bit
 mythri: ah, I do not know
 obengdako: you mean CDs with packages?
 flash works fine on 64bit
 eltigre: « apt-cache policy python »  Where did this strange python version come from?
 rgr: it's true
 eltigre: what does that command return?
 rgr: flash works as fine for me as it does on 32bit or on windows.  I don't know...
 !md5sums | [deXter]
 rgr: I don't believe that's the fact.  Flash can be installed and works as fine as flash generally works (hogs cpu, etc)
 rgr: which part is nonsense?
 eltigre: you have to figure out where that unofficial version of python came from and downgrade back to the official ubuntu version
 rgr: well maybe you misinterpret what I mean by fine.  By "fine" I mean it is usable.
 rgr: for everyone.
 rgr: point me to a bug
 I disagree. There's no reason not to use 64bit on the desktop if your hardware handles it
 eltigre: you need to remove that unofficial version of python
 scarra3: how much ram
 scarra3: use 64bit
 !ati | scarra3
 rgr: you select "classic desktop" at the login screen to turn it off
 !final | velory1
 !version | velory1
 thegoodcushion: packages.ubuntu.com is likely enough for you
 rgr: this channel is meant for ubuntu *support*, #ubuntu-offtopic is a good place to discuss unity
 econdudeawesome: what version of ubuntu is this?
 econdudeawesome: that's a bit confusing.  You can't disable X using rcconf
 econdudeawesome: why did you say you used rcconf?
 econdudeawesome: the proper way to stop gdm from starting is to just add "text" to your kernel line in grub
 econdudeawesome: try setterm
 econdudeawesome: you shouldn't need to restart
 econdudeawesome: does echoing the ansi escape sequence for "reset" or maybe "black background" work?
 econdudeawesome: what variation of setterm did you try exactly?
 conorhogan: yes
 econdudeawesome: how did you invoke "setterm" earlier?
 econdudeawesome: "text" is something you would add to your grub line in grub either manually one time to test or in grub's configuration file
 econdudeawesome: what shell do you use?
 ssav: why?
 econdudeawesome: what shell? bash, etc
 econdudeawesome: k
 ssav: don't you have ssh access as some other user?
 ssav: reset the user's password
 ssav: look into chpasswd
 econdudeawesome: at the end of the grub line (next to "splash")
 econdudeawesome: I meant to say *kernel* line
 econdudeawesome: sure
 strigoi66: no
 strigoi66: I meant "no" as in we can't check
 damiano__: this is likely unrelated but it is a good idea to use "service", not /etc/init.d
 SpaceBass: you need to be more specific as to how it is failing (pastebin)
 Soothsayer: if it's only at the download stage, it's ok
 SpaceBass: you don't have internet on the machine?
 Soothsayer: no
 SpaceBass: try the following: COMMAND | nc ssh.jrib.net 12345
 SpaceBass: you probably want to redirect stderr too.  Or just create a file you want to pastebin and send that to ssh.jrib.net on port 12345
 !upgrade | Cube``
 Cube``: follow the server instructions
 SpaceBass: yeah I have an old script I wrote that will listen and pastebin
 SpaceBass: it's mostly useless nowadays because of things like pastebinit but you can't install pastebinit easily because your packaging system is broken
 SpaceBass: in the meantime I need to grab some food.  I'll be back in 10.  I may have 12345 blocked on the router.  If so, I'll take care of that when I return :)
 SpaceBass: back
 !helpme | Eathuz
 so much non-support talk :(
 jaypur: best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
 jaypur: if no one answered wait patiently and repeat after about 10 minutes.  Please don't ask "who is using ..." as it's not very productive
 jaypur: if you have a computer that can handle 64bits, there's no reason nowadays not to use 64bit
 Soothsayer: what card?
 jaypur: what problems are you referring to exactly?  I've been using 64bit for many years without issues now
 jaypur: those haven't been problems for a long time.  I don't recall video drivers ever being a problem and adobe provides a 64bit version of flash now
 Soothsayer: do you know what video card you have?
 gartral: in what sense?
 gartral: ah, I haven't compared so that may be true.  But it works well enough for me
 thegoodcushion: please don't take polls here
 LjL, jpohl: probably policy-kit related
 pumeust: how did you edit it?
 !upgrade | Al-Bawi
 Al-Bawi: follow the server instructions (do-release-upgrade)
 pumeust: be more specific
 nevvermind1: if you really mean everything when you say "everything", then it's time to reinstall
 nevvermind1: and don't « sudo su root ».  If you really need a root shell, use « sudo -i »
 infamous: if you want desktop and you are on the server, you just install the ubuntu-desktop package
 wrinkliez: restart?
 lucydarrow: « sudo apt-get update »
 wrinkliez: restart?
 wrinkliez: check /var/log/Xorg.0.log and /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 Soothsayer: nautilus-open-terminal
 tesdsfsfdfds: classic? gnome3?
 !pl | tomasz
 lucydarrow: pastebin output
 lucydarrow: try a different mirror?
 lucydarrow: it's a pool of servers not just one server I believe
 Soothsayer: the user you created during install is in the admin group which can sudo by default
 !root | Soothsayer
 eol > LjL
 jatt: 11.04 is no longer beta
 Harkins__: chroot, investigate, possibly dpkg --configure -a, sudo apt-get install -f, may be helpful
 shoxzy: "isn't working" is too vague to give meaningful advice
 shoxzy: did you install an sshd on the ipod?
 shoxzy: are you sure that's the right ip?
 shoxzy: try reconnecting to your network on your ipod
 Ubuntu_user: what program are you trying to install?
 Ubuntu_user: why not use the netbeans in the repository?
 Ubuntu_user: make the file executable (chmod +x file) and execute it (./file).  Keep in mind you should read its documentation to see if there are any special requirements and what to learn what to do if you want to remove it.
 Courz: erm, why?
 Courz: ask #perl
 Ubuntu_user: I told you the commands
 Ubuntu_user: what's your question though?  I told you the command already
 Ubuntu_user: no, if you are in /home/username/Desktop, you can type ./netbeans.sh ('.' represents the directory you are in).  If you are somewhere else, you can give the full path like you just suggested: /home/username/Desktop/netbeans.sh
 vampire: now run the command with "LANG=C" so we can understand it
 loseweight: if you don't want to use vi, use nano
 loseweight: ESCAPE:wq   in the future use nano
 loseweight: yes, it does.
 loseweight: press escape, then colon, then w, then q, then enter.
 loseweight: no?
 loseweight: then I recommend you start over in nano
 loseweight: close the terminal
 !anyone | SargonRose
 loseweight: close your terminal and do what you want to do in nano.
 loseweight: make them again
 zertyui: depends if they allow you to upload presumably
 Osmodivs: pass the url of the iso to wget
 loseweight: it's different
 loseweight: if you don't know how to use vi, I'd say nano is better
 zertyui: depends on how the server is configured
 SargonRose: best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
 zertyui: ok?
 zertyui: yes, so?
 zertyui: what kind of server is it...?
 zertyui: ftp, ssh, etc
 poipoi: no gui, but sure
 poipoi: no graphical user interface
 zertyui: you're not answering my questions, how can I answer yours...
 zertyui: what kind of server is it...?
 zertyui: ftp, ssh, etc
 zertyui: then no, you probably can't upload...
 zertyui: you can certainly write scripts that allow users to upload
 zertyui: you can ask ##php for help creating such a script
 poipoi: no
 Soothsayer: /opt/cyberoam/crclient/foo
 !samba | Flynsarmy
 Flynsarmy: so you tried to mount the share using cifs and the options on the wiki (including "guest")?  What was the result?
 Flynsarmy: "guest indicates you don't need a password to access the share, "
 Flynsarmy: no problem
 Flynsarmy: what command are you executing exactly?
 Flynsarmy: so it works now?
 Flynsarmy: should be your sudo password, no?
 Flynsarmy: what happens with lowercase "guest"?
 Flynsarmy: can you access the share elsewhere?  Like from another windows machine?
 astory: sudo apt-get update
 astory: choose a local mirror
 astory: it was System → Administration → Software Sources at least once in the past
 astory: ok, edit /etc/apt/sources.list
 !mirrors | astory
 he makes cookies
 !compile | alone08
 alone08: you know ed is in the repositories and you probably have it already?
 !upgrade | Froq
 Froq: follow the server instructions there (do-release-upgrade)
 charas: what do you expect it to do?
 charas: oh, is that some unity shortcut?
 charas: ah, no idea then
 osse: there shouldn't be any significant difference, yes
 osse: if you take a fresh 10.10 install and upgrade it should be the same as an 11.04 install.  Obviously, if you make changes to 10.10 and upgrade those changes affect your upgrade result vs a fresh 11.04 install...
 osse: you'll likely have both installed
 scoffin: yes, remove indicator-appmenu iirc
 scoffin: it's a package
 scoffin: cool
 Droose: select "classic" at the login screen
 jefimenko: for TTYs when you press ctrl-alt-f1 you mean?
 LjL: I read your question but have no clue and if I recall correctly that cookie was confiscated from me -_-
 TheWubber: check ~/.config/vlc/
 !final | NickUK`
 NickUK`: what's the output you get from running « sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade » ?
 NickUK`: no it's not
 NickUK`: use a pastebin
 NickUK`: still there?
 NickUK`: can you pastebin the full output?
 NickUK`: that indicates you *are* up to date
 NickUK`: how?
 NickUK`: what update?  Do « apt-cache policy PACKAGE » on the package
 NickUK`: if you must, but I'd prefer it if we stayed in channel (just read the highlighted text and ignore the rest)
 !ssh | usalabs
 stix: [:space:] (see "man grep")
 !upgrade | xskydevilx
 xskydevilx: you must use the alternate cd for that
 pseubodot: what does "force X to work minimally" mean?
 pseubodot: check /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 pseubodot: ctrl-alt-f1 does not work?
 pseubodot: what did you do differently?  Wasn't it black before?
 s093294: use find (hint: -type d -exec)
 s093294: what did you try?
 s093294: checkout "basename"
 econdudeawesome: create ~/.xinitrc with what you wish to run.  Why aren't you using gdm though?
 !9.10 | bahamas
 !here | siddhantchd
 bahamas: you should upgrade to at least 10.04
 bahamas: I don't know.  How much ram do you have?  What cpu?
 bahamas: should work fine
 trollboy: select "classic" at the login screen
 GreeNtooTH: no, 11.04 has been released
 wolfy_: df is a terminal program...
 wolfy_: you're looking for du
 frankS2: dpkg -S /bin/ls
 wolfy_: baobab (you could have just asked for gui first)
 frankS2: dpkg -L
 jw_: keep in mind you have a choice in window managers
 thien: if it's mounted, sure
 ghostnik11: try a live cd
 amstan: the ubuntu packages are broken?
 ChR0n05: never
 ChR0n05: what do you mean by "available"?  jumping off bridges is available too...
 ChR0n05: sudo runs programs.  su is a program
 ChR0n05: that doesn't mean it's a good idea to run it
 ChR0n05: to properly obtain a root shell you should use « sudo -i »
 econdudeawesome: didn't you ask this yesterday?  And I suggested you setup your ~/.xinitrc?  What's wrong with that?
 econdudeawesome: ok, ignore the first question... why can't you use ~/.xinitrc?
 econdudeawesome: so you want to use gdm?
 econdudeawesome: what happens when you execute « sudo service gdm start »?
 econdudeawesome: did gdm ever start?
 econdudeawesome: do you have any idea what changed when it stopped starting?
 econdudeawesome: so kdm starts now?
 econdudeawesome: so what happens now when you boot?
 tom11: view the differences and decide
 econdudeawesome: sure, you may want to check /etc/X11/default-display-manager first though
 econdudeawesome: file
 tom11: go with the new version, the only significant change is that an option seems to have been renamed
 tom11: and it's commented anyway :)
 Roger_Bonjabee: most clients do
 newubuntu: best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
 newubuntu: if you fix the time, when is it incorrect again?
 newubuntu: replace the cmos battery?
 newubuntu: well replace the battery and rule it out
 !who | newubuntu
 newubuntu: does the issue present itself if you boot windows, shutdown, boot windows again?
 newubuntu: I'm trying to.  But can only do so if you answer questions
 newubuntu: make linux use local time: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime#Make%20Linux%20use%20%27Local%27%20time
 OneSquared: you need to describe what sort of rule you want to use to rename them-
 newubuntu: in what way?
 newubuntu: well try the other option
 newubuntu: if it currently says "no", then change it to "yes"
 newubuntu: use "gksudo gedit /etc/default/rcS"
 nerdshell: if you mean "./setup.sh" it just runs setup.sh which can do whatever it wants
 Silekonn: why install ubuntu and kubuntu?  Just install kubuntu-desktop package on your ubuntu install
 Silekonn: but you understand that installing kubuntu-desktop will give you an identical setup to what you get with kubuntu and you get to choose your environment at the login screen?
 Silekonn: "cust. systems"?
 Silekonn: well with ubuntu you'll have gdm whereas kubuntu users would see kdm.  That would be different, yes
 Silekonn: you should be able to select manual partitioning during install and do what you want, just choose not to format the partitions that already have data on them
 researcher: please ask in #ubuntu-offtopic, this channel is focused on support
 !away > sebrock
 k_sze: the one you like best is the best
 k_sze: personally I like xmonad.  Awesome is another popular one
 k_sze: I remember reading the name came from barney's character in HIMYM
 genii-around: neat syntax:  chown user: file  is equivalent to  chown user:userlogingroup file
 Wolf_22: what is "the startup.sh"?
 Wolf_22: I'm not familiar with this file.  Where is it located?
 andreaborman: you shouldn't do it.  You shouldn't be doing sudo things that often that it would annoy you.  If you think you know best, read « man sudoers » about NOPASSWD.  Again, it's not a good idea
 iggyology: this channel is for *support* only.  If you want to discuss other things, there is #ubuntu-offtopic.
 iggyology: no
 jcapinc: I suggest mentioning your video card
 mamad: best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
 mamad: this one; just ask your question
 Archie18_: this is likely a #python question as « from multiprocessing import Pool » works fine here on 10.10.  Does that work for you?
