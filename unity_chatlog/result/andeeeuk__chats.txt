 hi everyone
 does anyone know how to setup single window mode in gimp ubuntu?
 ruffleS i used to have it on 10.10 but since the upgrade it has not worked
 http://ppa.launchpad.net/matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn/ubuntu ruffleS that was the PPA i have used
 has anyone else got gimp in single window mode
 Halzen yeah I had that before, did you get it from that repo?
 Halzen yeah that is what i use
 Halzen i have that all done, what do you use?
 Halzen i think i need to update my repos first and then it will upgrade
 Halzen, do you use photoshot now then?
 Halzen, nice one!!
 Halzen, do you have any problems with it at all?
 Halzen good stuff, I had cs4 running without any problems
 Halzen, was really good
 Halzen, I would do but it does dost a lot
 Halzen, yeah for a pro i can see why, I have been uding gimp for a while now as well and have found it a great tool. Really bad without single window mode though
 I must say that I am so pleased with ubuntu 11.04
 works soo well, initially I was having doubts about unity
 whatever you do do not install gnome 3 over unity its skrews everything up!!! not worth it!!
 I made that mistakte!!
