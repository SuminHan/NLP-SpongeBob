 histo: I thought it was "Mutter"
 buhman1 forces: #ubuntu-release-party will tell you
 Monotoko: I've heard WoW runs faster in Ubuntu from those of my friends who play it.
 macross: Are you using Metacity or Compiz?
 Monotoko: Well, if your processor is slow then running something like WoW is going to be *very* slow. Ask in ##hardware to see if it might be your computer or Ubuntu. That way we have it narrowed down a bit.
 Raikia: Wait 2-4 weeks. That's what I'm doing.
 plustax: Run the update manager
 plustax: In a terminal "sudo apt-get update"
 plustax: Then open Update Manager again.
 Stameni: AFAIK it uses the "Main Menu" by default but other than that it's mostly the same.
 tdn: They've been merged into one.
 Stameni: You choose it at login. Like any other Desktop Environment.
 galamar: Just update.
 Ziber: Have you properly written the .iso too the drive?
 Ziber: What Ubuntu version are you using?
 Ziber: Oh.... I couldn't tell you.
 Ziber: Reinstall gdm?
 mbrochh: Did you log out?
 Vustom: You want to reformat your whole hard drive or just overwrite Ubuntu?
 Vustom: (By the way, long time no see! I hope Ubuntu has been treating you well!)
 Vustom: I'd say just open up GParted from a LiveCD and wipe it all.
 Vustom: I'm excited for Gnome3 but it looks like I'll have to wait for 11.10 for that one.
 Vustom: What does your hard drive setup look like?
 ZykoticK9: I know, but hopefully Gnome3 will be able to run in 11.10. OTherwise, they'll be pulling a proprietary move by restricint g what you can/can't use in whicih case I'll drop them like a bad habit.
 Vustom: You said you wanted to reformat everything, not just Ubuntu, but you want to keep Windows? Explain on one line what you want to do. Is it just dual boot of Ubuntu and Windows?

 Vustom: F11 is a Windows-only option I think. So, since it's only in Windows, have you tried booting into Windows and trying ti then while the Windows thing is going?
 Vustom: No, I mean select Windows, then press F11
 Vustom: Alright, so if it's included in the Windows bootloader then just reinstall Windows, as that overwrites all Linux.
 silvery: Are you using a 11.04 disc?
 Vustom: Contact HP, I'd say they have a recovery thing. That, or like Dell they may have a partition for recovery.
 Vustom: Again, I'd say contact HP. They'd know their HDD setup better than us.
 sighhhh: Which Ubuntu version?
 ejv: Well, they dumped OpenOffice and Rhythmbox. (And now use what I've been using for months, so I'm pleased)
 ejv: Yep. I thinkt hat the only exciting thing for the version itself (other than Unity, of course) is they dumped OpenOffice which is a pretty bold move.
 ejv: Libre is a fork of Open. They didn't like how things were ebing handled so they formed LibreOffice,
 Rehan: You can upgrade with the AlternateCD I believe.
 Rehan: Then just grab it from the torrent the link to, or find one on a torrent site as I'm sure one's already there. Normal LiveCD

 pennnn: That is a personal choice which you must make yourself. Try it out and see if you like it. Also, that is off-topic for here.

 pennnn: Read those. UInderstand the channel rules.
 pennnn: You cannot get an answer because you are nto asking a question.
 pennnn: Nobody can make thew decision for you. Have you tried it out?
 pennnn: 11.10 is still 6 months away.
 maedox: #ubuntu_1 is invitation-only for now
 pennnn: So start the switch now. You have 6 months. You're making a switch either way. You're either switching to Gnome3, KDE, or Unity. Choose one, and stick with it.
 pennnn: That's because Canonical does not support Gnome3. All other distros do, though.
 pennnn: You could try Xubuntu. Very similar to Gnome 2
 No, he's up in arms about how 11.10 won't have classic GNOME even when the Gnome devs themselves don't support it anymore.
 vibhav: ^
 vibhav: No, it's about 11.10 that he's freaking out about because 11.10 won't have "Classic Gnome"
 llutz: It's invitation-only.
 llutz: Umm... I agree. Which is why I'm trying to explain to him that it's a long way away. HE's asking if he should switch to KDE. I told him 11.10 is still 6 months away anyway, but if he wants to switch to KDE he should try it.
 pennnn: I do use Gnome. I am on 10.10 because I do not wish to switch to 11.04. If I had a choice I would be using Gnome3 but it is not supported on 10.10 currently.
 pennnn: I will use it after about 3-4 weeks of its release. I want toallow some time for the bugs to be found and fixed in case the devs and beta testers missed any (which they probably did). Gnome3 can be run on 11.04, but it kills Unity (which is fine with me as I'm not a fan of it).
 vibhav: Gnome3 in 11.04, right?
 pennnn: And which do you like?
 sdollins: I haven't noticed. I'm using Pidgin.
 sdollins: Ah. I guess I've kind of trained myself to "phase out" the sign-in/sign-out. There's an otion to have those nto show up but I kept talking ot myself then.
 The next person who even so much as utters the word "troll" will be on my blacklist and I will be unhappy at you for the rest of my life.
 pennnn: Seeing as the fact that the Gnome developers are not developing Gnome2 any longer, it is not likely, no. Canonical will continue to mainain it for the use of Unity, but what they do  with it at this point is to their discretion.
 pennnn: Your question has been answered.
 pennnn: You're welcome.
 syrinx_: He's gone!!! He's really, really gone!! (After tlling him that exact same thing two OTHER times)
 Haha. Nobody can be rww like rww.
 VanDyke: Don't do that.
 tuxx-: Buy two get the second half off?
 sdollins: Ubuntu of the community? Because I am now hating this channel very much.
 s/of/or
 sdollins: I am waiting a month before upgrading, at which point I'll use Gnome3
 Herbs: No one said anything negative about Ubuntu.
 Herbs: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought he meant the trolls in this channel.
 Herbs: You're right. I'm wrong. :)
 thegoodcushion: There's MythBuntu that's made for something to do with TV. Can't recall what exactly. May be worth looking into.
 thegoodcushion: Not necessarily installing the whole distro -- but maybe downloading what packages it has by default.
 Herbs: Don't.
 sdollins: Well there's nothing you can do, man. IF you like Gnome2, Xfce is the closest ot tht you'll get. Really, Gnome2 is essentially deprecated, and will totally be deprecate soon.
 thegoodcushion: Except that Gnome does not support it anymore. Cacnonical does.
 thegoodcushion: If I understand correctly, anyway.
 marenostrum: You can also use Gnome3
 Herbs: +1
 thegoodcushion: Is what in a PPA?
 marenostrum: Well, Gnome3 breaks Unity so you can't exactly "revert"
 marenostrum: But yeah, in 11.04 it's available in a PPA. http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/04/gnome-3-released-to-be-available-for-ubuntu-11-04-via-ppa/ You can try it on a LiveCD from the Fedora 15 Alpha or something sfrom the folks at SUSE
 DocPlatypus: I agree. Dirst thing I'll do. ;)
 sdollins: The general consensus seemed to be no, so I guess not. But hey, they're the largest Linux distro around now. They can do whatevere they want.
 sdollins: But that's not a topic for discussion here.
 thegoodcushion: Exactly. Currently they are. Only time will tell if it's continued.
 thegoodcushion: Very true.
 marenostrum: Well, I don't know Fedora very well,but Fedora with Gnome3 LiveCD was quite nice.  http://www.gnome3.org/
 sdollins: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE... Plus, there's Ubuntu with Gnome2, Ubuntu with Gnome3, Ubuntu with KDE, Ubuntu with Unity, not to mention AwesomeWM, e17...
 sdollins: Ah yes, and Linux Mint, ElementaryOS...
 marenostrum: I'd try it from a LiveCD. Again, I hear that there isn't really a "reversal process" so just keepin mind that you've been warned. I've not tried it myself so it could be easy, I don't know. I could be over-reacting. Just be aware. :)
 marenostrum: Alright.

 SLruan: Ask in #kubuntu
 mysteriousdarren: Eh, he's using KDE anyway so... If he doesn't get an answer then we'll try. :)
 cretsiah: Avast! and ClamAV are popular choices.
 cretsiah: Avast! is also nice on Windows, so if you have a dual-boot you could always use the same on both. ;)
 cretsiah: You're welcome. By the way, most people with Linux for a while use ClamAV. I used Avast! but it stopped working on me, so ClamAV is the "cool kid" in Linux world. Try both though and see what suits you.
