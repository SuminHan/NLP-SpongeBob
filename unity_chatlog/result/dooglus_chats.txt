 when I update it tells me "natty InRelease: The following signatures were invalid: NODATA 1 NODATA 2"
 what do?
 !info unity-2d
 frag4now: /var/cache/apt/archives/
 frag4now: "locate .deb"
 frag4now: "sudo apt-get clean" will delete them and free a bunch of space.  you don't need them once they're installed
 frag4now: look into apt-cacher.  that's what I use to only download each package once
 frag4now: each of my computers points to the 'server' in its sources.list, and the server caches the .deb files, so each one is only downloaded once
 !info apt-cacher
 frag4now: some .deb files are arch-independant.  some aren't
 frag4now: apt-cacher will take care of that for you
 frag4now: if the package name has _i386.deb at the end, it's Intel.  if it has _all.deb, it's independent
 when I update, apt-get gives me an error message:
 W: GPG error: http://server natty InRelease: The following signatures were invalid: NODATA 1 NODATA 2
 is it safe?
 I'm asking an ubuntu question
 when I update, apt-get gives me an error message: "W: GPG error: http://server natty InRelease: The following signatures were invalid: NODATA 1 NODATA 2".  what does that mean?
 Incarus6: it's my apt-cacher server
 Incarus6: it's worked for years, and still works ("Get:1 http://server/security/ natty-security/main firefox-globalmenu i386 4.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1 [50.5 kB]") - but I'm getting that GPG error since yesterday
