 Think of the release date more as a guide than a statement of actual temporal certainty
 sancas: ~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db
 sancas: that's an sqlite3 database that you can use if you're so inclined
 sancas: I believe so
 sancas: assuming you're on the samish version of banshee
 tripelb: you can configure how fonts look on your current system (and I assume on unity)
 tripelb: System -> Preferences -> Appearance, then the Fonts tab. If you're using an LCD then turn Subpixel rendering on and then tweak it by clicking Details...
 sancas: I'm not sure, it might store absolute paths in the database
 tripelb: you're going to have to be a lot more specific than it's 'better on windows'
 oh, than turn subpixel off
 try grayscale
 tripelb: what
 tripelb: I meant grayscale font smoothing
 not grayscale display
 because subpixel rendering is designed for lcd's so it won't work very well on crt
 tripelb: WRT your other questions, the easiest way to partition your drives is probably to burn a livecd, boot into that and use gparted to divide your drive in half - though you may want swap partitions for each installation
 uncmar: on an lcd, each pixel is mad eup of three lights: a red a green and a blue one
 subpixel rendering means controlling the individual lights to achieve a better result
 uncmar: well no
 uncmar: crts work by projecting beams through a phosphor coating at the screen
 tripelb: regarding accessing your other hard drive: if you go Places -> Computer your other drive sohuld be there and you should be able to double click it to access the files on that drive
 sancas: open a terminal and do killall -9 banshee - that will forcibly terminate banshee
 revButl: you can just make a main partition and a swap partition - it's not really special how you configure it and it won't change your entertainment potential
 also, you can resize and add partitions later if you want
 it's not 2000 anymore :D
 sancas: np
 viranch: sometime in the next 24hours probablky
 viranch: no
 viranch: I think they leave it flexible in case there are last minute issues
 viranch: you can join #ubuntu-release-party if you like and await 11.04
 induz: Start -> System -> Administration -> Task Manager
 then click the cpu column to sort desecending
 also try clicking the memory column and sort decending to see if something's taking up all your ram
 viranch: np
 induz: something is chewing your ram
 induz: try sorting by memory usage descending
 tripelb: ah I see. To deal with the permissions issue you may be able to run gksudo nautilus and copy the files in that window
 tripelb: I'm not sure why you can't see the partition from the other installation
 syddraf: uname -a
 induz: Go to the task manager, sort by memory usage descending then click the top item and click kill process
 tripelb: np
 induz: repeat until success
 syddraf: you're 32-bit
 syddraf: np
 induz: only if a program is doing something wrong and using memory badly
 induz: not usually
 jstrap: what's wrong with the video at the moment? is the resolution too low or...
 jstrap: try going to System -> Preferences -> Monitors
 jstrap: see if it will let you increase the resolution
 induz: true, it is a bit risky
 induz: I mean if you're not sure, rebooting should sort it out
 jstrap: you have an nvidia chipset?
 jstrap: If so, then I believe you have two options: the driver that nvidia supplies, and a new open-source driver built by the community
 jstrap: I'd suggest maybe trying both if you're not sure - I don't have nvidia so I can't recommend which one
 let me link you
 jstrap: yeah np. DO you know what version of ubuntu you have installed?
 jstrap: ok, you have a couple options. You can upgrade your ubuntu to a later version (which is different to installing the updates); this is probably a good idea anyway as 9.04 is a few years old now
 either way you can switch to the nvidia supplied drivers if you like - here is a howto https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
 jstrap: the current Long Term Support release of ubuntu is 10.04 lucid, and the latest version is 10.10 maverick
 jstrap: although 11.04 natty is coming out in the next day or so ;)
 jstrap: ok -though you can upgrade ubuntu over the internet if you want
 jstrap: assuming you have a decent internet connection

 cordoval_: click both buttons at once
