 I executed a make clean as sudo, which ran "rm -r /usr/*". As soon as I realized this, I cancelled, but at least /usr/bin is already gone. After some research on Google, my best solution is to boot the Ubuntu CD, copy the /usr/bin folder from there to my hdd and then executing "sudo apt-get install --fix-broken". Does anyone have a better idea?
