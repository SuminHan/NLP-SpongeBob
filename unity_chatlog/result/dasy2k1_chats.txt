 anyone any idea where /sys/devices/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice_load has moved to with 11.
 11.04 that should have read
 Herbs unity looks more like Mac to me with that blasted dock and the menus being in the top bar
 rgoytacaz: look in restricted drivers (in system) check its activated
 rgoytacaz:  yeh new name same program
 rgoytacaz:  deactivate then reactivate then reboot, should work then
 rgoytacaz:  no idea on that one
 rgoytacaz:  have to pass you on to somone more experianced then, thats going beyond what i have experianced getting nvidia to work
 anyone know where the cpu scaling settings (like ignore nice load) have moved to (used to be in /sys/devices/cpu/cpufreq)??
 ohsix: the stock one AFAIK on 10.10
 ohsix:  used to set /sys/devices/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice_load to 1 to stop boinc maxing my cpu all the time
 ohsix:  yeh the governer settings, cant seem to find them now
 ohsix:  ahh missing the extra system, found them now
 ohsix:  thought somone had moved them :-o
 lol true
 afroman:  draks boot and nuke
 rpk ubuntuforums.org
 afroman:  as far as you can be sure, its gone.... ok if you are the CIA and have years to spend analaising every molicule you may be able to find one or 2 bits but in general its gone
 usr13:  better to use /dev/urandom for the first 6 passes
 anonemoose:  should be compatable
 ncg dont ask to ask , just ask
 yi`zhi: it will be there somwhere, but if you are using unity it may take some finding!
 yi`zhi:  easy to install things as before but the interface is a bit differnt, if you use classic it will be exactly where you expect it tho
 anonemoose: only if you accedentally tick keep the disc open... (excepting the normal amount of coasters that you get with any dvd buring)
 fezzik02:  via grub-install normally
 afroman:  not sure why you would want to do that. if you want to delete things use shred -u
 rpk still there, you just have to press esc as soon as you see the brown screen
 springscar: its an indicator applett session you have removed
 JoshuaYoshua: boot the disk, then hit escape when you see the first ubuntu screen, then use check disc for defects
 afroman:  probabbly. but i dont know it off the top of my head GIYF
 JoshuaYoshua: ahh, windows default software will most likley just burn the .iso as a single file to a data disk rather then burn the iso to the disk as an image
 Drone4four: its alt+F2
 Drone4four:  are you using unity or classic?
 Drone4four:  working for me, you could allways add the run applet to the panel
 soreau: thats because its one applet, indicator applet session
 bittyx-laptop: alt+printscreen then K
 soreau:  just add the old applets you want, indicator applet rather than indicator applet complete
 lsheeba:  if you have a working install of ubuntu i would just use update manager
 kyle___: install cd (64 bit) workd fine for me
 Ash-catchem:  try running memtest, random crashes are often caused by bad ram
 !flash | nesto1000
 most likely EbanSoul, try the bittorrent downloands, they should be fast
 MrOpposite: screen for X apps, isnt that called multiple desktops?
 MrOpposite:  i would just use screen then
 green_:  just log out and log back in again selecting ubuntu classic
