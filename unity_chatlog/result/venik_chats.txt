 cannot upgrade to 11.04-- "Could not calculate the upgrade"...
 this bug has been there for 5 years...
 AMD64
 it worked fine on another machine (32 bit)
 I removed Ubuntu-desktop
 made no difference
 I removed the ubuntu-desktop AFTER the upgrade failed, because someone suggested that it might help
 perhaps I should reinstall ubuntu-desktop (and face Mecca)
 it cannot be the explanation, since in all my first attempts the ubuntu-desktop was there
 I upgraded for the past 4 or 5 versions, with no need for clean installation, but now I probably reached the end of the line
 the upgrade never finished-- I got the error message mentioned above (COuld not calculate the upgrade)
 doing it now, although with little hope, since that is how I started
 Installing ubuntu-desktopo installs a lot of useless junk, like Empathy and Telepathy, etc., but I shall swallow it
 why does it take forever on WAITING FOR HEADERS?
 boot in 10 seconds... waiting for heareds-- eternity
 when I upgraded to thunderbird 3.1.9 I was told that lightning is not compatible with it (v. 1.02b) on 64 bit ubuntu.  What do I do?
 I am having problems with SAMBA on 11.04
 share do not appear
