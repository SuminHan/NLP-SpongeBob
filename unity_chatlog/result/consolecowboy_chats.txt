 i need to write a script that mimicks the highlighting of the word the cursor is currently at. how could this be achieved?
 i'll rephrase: i need a command tool that will let me select or highlight the word a cursor is currently on, to be further processed with xsel and other tools
 skybound: yes, so if i'm typing anywhere, text editor, browser, i can hit a key that will run a little script. first thing i need it to do is 'highlight' the word that has just been typed
 i'm aiming for a text replacement tool
 (used snippits but can't install in 11.04)
 xsinick: if the application is in the menu, you can right click and 'add this launcher to desktop'
 i think
 skybound: yeah, i found snippits in lifehacker, became one of my favourite apps, very simple, a little buggy, no longer developed, ruby. but couldn't install because i can't seem to upgrade rubygems. i could try harder to do this, but i figured i might try to write my own version
 skybound: right, thanks, i'll see what i can find
