 pmitros: middle click on the Terminal button in the Launcher
 _Neytiri_: sudo umount filepath
 rgr: telling people they should have just googled it is like saying  rtfm which is rude

 s33k: are you trying to edit a directory? you can only edit files

 Tomboy

 Inphernal: I'm guessing you have several PPAs
 Inphernal: you could paste.ubuntu.com your sources.list

 cool
 harushimo: yes, python 2.7 is default for 11.04
 Inphernal: oh I forgot that PPA repos aren't stored in that file

 Inphernal: sorry, I'm just not sure how to walk you through the upgrade safely
 I've forced upgrades on my computer but I don't think that's good advice for me to be giving here
