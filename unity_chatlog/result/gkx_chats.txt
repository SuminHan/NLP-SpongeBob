 Hi there. I'm using NVidia on Natty Narwhal, and the world appears to be crashing down on me. Can someone help?
 I don't know how. :) Or, at least, I tried and it didn't seem to work.
 cheapie: I load Natty Narwhal off of dual boot, and it gives me a black screen
 cheapie: I'm running failsafe graffics right now
 Before
 Which drivers?
 cheapie: It's really hard to work with my graphics right now. Everything is in the wrong resolution, which is a graphics problem I struggled with on a regular basis on 10.10
 cheapie: So, to answer your question, I can't quite access that
 cheapie: Did so now, it didn't appear to do anything.
 Yes
 cheapie: Yes
 cheapie: Yes.
 Yeah, let me just figure out how to IRC on a mac. :P Shouldn't take too long
