 is there someone who knows how XFRM works?
 sorry you're right
 I'd like to know how XFRM (ip xfrm policy\state) check keys, if it does
 checks*
 because I need to add an SA (security association)
 the outbound SA adding works fine
 but the inbound SA adding doesn't work
 do you have any idea?
 no one could help me? do I have to be more clear?
