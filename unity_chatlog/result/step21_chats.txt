 Scott-Mc, 11.04 is #ubuntu+1
 oops
 ScottONanski1, 11.04 is in #ubuntu+1
 awh ... wanted to dist-upgrade to release but apparently nothing to upgrade to yet ... mirrors take forevvvvvver
 stefg, I am on beta2 already, works well. just want to upgrade to release
 stefg, okay, then I am on release level. thanks for clearing that up
 burg, this is likely due to gnome3/shell ... try removing it ^^
 Joseph_, good to know, but at some other time
 gogeta, then what are you doing here?
 burg, any other pkgs that the ppa installed?
 burg, I heard installing from source worked better with gnome2/unity side by side
 burg, there is a guide on webupd8.org
 lazlo, in unity?
 lazlo, which panel? you know it looks different, right?
 and has less panel
 s
 lazlo, bout you can log into classic?
 lazlo, does alt+F2 do anything?
 lazlo, try ctrl+alt+F1
 elssha, you can't boot into classic or into rescue mode?
 llutz, I have no idea what you mean ...
 ssav, there is no such thing, it is called security
 elssha, did you answer my question from before?
 cordoval_, reinstall from cd
 ssav, I don't know your application ... you could try scripting passwd, but that only works if you know the password, remotely there is no other way afaik
 elssha, if you can boot classic or in rescue mode
 elssha, yes
 ssav, I don't think with your knowledge what you want will work
 elssha, so you can't choose to login to classic in gdm?
 elssha, if you are on that pc now, what are you running if nothing works?
 cordoval_, someone told you before what to put into the console to try a recovery, otherwise start the install again
 elssha, but no terminal or alt-F2 and I guess you have auto-login?
 MichealH, normally it autohides
 elssha, then log into classic and try to fix things from there
 elssha, where you log in, at the  bottom there is a bar where you can choose to log into an environment that is more like the old version, it should work
 MichealH, it is called something like compiz-config-settings-manager
 Fodi69, not afaik
 Fodi69, prob because that's how it makes sense ... in classic you can still configure them
 Fodi69, also, don't spam
 Fodi69, I find it quite usable. like I said if you want the old one back choose classic at login
 jiltdil, depends on personal preference
 Fodi69, taste varies I guess. anything specific that you don't like (not that I can do anything about it)
 gogeta, this is support and I'm not really hre to get into that argument
 Eduard, ppa or compile, google is your friend
 Edgan, I don't think there is a stable one. webupd8.org has links to ppa and to compile, apparently compiling works better with a running system
 proq, I think wubi is not quite ready for 11.04
 johnjaylward, deeeeeeeeet
 johnjaylward, define widget
 Samsagax, weather at top or so works ... webupd8.org ...
 entity, check for errors?
 zetheroo, because it's a whole new program ... if you need your menu you have to use gnome afaik
 zetheroo, i don't think so... then you couldn't switch what you always can on linux
 entity, I would boot from livecd and check the disk from there (without mounting) did you do an upgrade or so right before?
 zetheroo, he's right, this is for support primarily
 zetheroo, take it somewhere else plz ...
 entity, it's hard to tell what went wrong, did it mention any errors before reboot? otherwise try to boot from livecd or rescue mode and check the disk (it doesn't have to be mounted)
 zetheroo, then what's wrong w normal gnome?
 Osmodivs, - #freenode
 zetheroo, oh so you upgraded and it doesn't work? I though you just didn't like/want it...
 entity, yes, but I meant before when you ran the upgrade
 alienkid10, what connection?
 alienkid10, but this could also be self-shut down because of inactivity. I would boot from livecd and check the grub settings
 alienkid10, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromUSB 'Booting via usb' and then check if in /boot/grub/grub.conf the right drive is entered. or you could try it on the grub command line
 alienkid10, I think it is most likely that grub passes the wrong root to the kernel or doesn't find the kernel
 alienkid10, yeah I know, but it doesn't seem to work. it's just that if it shuts down that quickly this is most likely. otherwise boot into livecd and look at syslog for errors
 alienkid10, just make sure it's the one of the installed system, not the livecd's ;)
 alienkid10, if the drives match up. you can compar with the output of 'sudo blkid' I think.
 alienkid10, yeah ...
 alienkid10, about the grub4dos combo, I'm not really sure if it could cause errors. should be fine if you get to normal grub I guess.
 alienkid10, okay
 becky, can you just not log into unity? try another desktop environment (bar at the bottom on login) and check if that works
 ouyes, google thinkpad x201 and check which version has the most support for it :)
 ouyes, but as people on google, people here just say what they think. Basically it should run, there is no clear better
 OY1R, something seems wrong with that install anyway ... from where did you reinstall it and did you have a special layout?
 alienkid10, me I guess ...
 ?
 OY1R, weird ... if you don't have any data to lose, I think the easiest would be to reinstall and make sure that it install grub in the mbr
 alienkid10, okay. did you check /var/log/syslog
 isarl, xserver-xorg-video-nouveau iirc
 deena, if you are already able to use it, it si not neccessary
 alienkid10, just paste the last few lines or anything that looks like errors
 deegee_, well, everything has some graphics card. probably yours (especially if it is on-board) is not sufficient.
 isarl, good to hear
 alienkid10, maybe paste some more ... looks normal so far
 isarl, yes, if it is not that could help
 i thought it would be a required dependency anyway
 bazhang, doesn't natty have fx4?
 isarl, umh, from what?
 isarl, maybe better after restart?
 alienkid10, mmmh. what file system on sdb1 (the usb drive i presume)?
 alienkid10, okay
 alienkid10, just ping when you are back
 isarl, if nouveau is not proprietary, it will not shop up in add. drivers
 isarl, sec
 isarl, check /var/log/Xorg.0.log (the end) for the driver used and something like dri = 1 or 'enabled or so
 isarl, could be good ... could you paste it?
 alienkid10, hey
 isarl, try force reinstall all x-related packages? or at least reconfigure? does it say why it failed?
 alienkid10, oh okay ... does it mention sdb2 somewhere in the logs? I don't see it
 isarl, reading
 alienkid10, but no errors with regard to it?
 alienkid10, anything 'not found' or 'couldn't access'?
 alienkid10, any other errors?
 isarl, could you check if it missed to install any nouveau/dri/glx packages?
 alienkid10, anything that looks like an error or 'no such file, no access, etc.
 alienkid10, can you past me some lines before the'bootloader not found'
 alienkid10, mmh okay. well I can only offer to look at the whole logs, otherwise I am out of ideas atm
 isarl, is lbdrm-nouveau1a installed?
 alienkid10, sure, can't hurt :)
 isarl, no, those are bad ...
 isarl, is xserver-xorg-video-nv still installed? if yes, try to remove
 isarl, yes, or restart x, but restart is prob easier
 alienkid10, sure. sorry that it didn't work so far
 alienkid10, not sure if I can helpt but sure
 isarl, argh. okay ...
 lol
 isarl, mmh, sorry, but not sure what to try now either and I should get going
 isarl, it did that before as well
 d1gital, there is always complaining :)
 maddie, are you using the livecd?
 maddie, good luck, but no idea then
