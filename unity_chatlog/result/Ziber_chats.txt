 escott: where would i find that? slightly new to ubuntu.
 In ubuntu, is there any way to sync all files between two folders? As in, I want them to be exactly the same, and they mostly already are. Rather than recopying everything, is there a tool to just recopy whats changed?
 Ampelbein: hm, thanks
 Devil999: rsync works, thanks tho
 Huh. I'm on a live CD, installing ubuntu. Installer seems to be just sitting at 79%, not looking like its doing much
 What should I do if my installer just seems to sitting at a certain percentage (in this case, 79%)... Seemingly not doing anything.
 How long should "creating user" really take when installing ubuntu? Has been sitting at that in the installer for about 5 mins now.
 Why would my install seemingly stop... installing and just sit at 79%?
 escott: nope...
 escott: Progress bar, 79%, "creating user..."
 escott: I already have, came before it.
 escott: no other window associated with it.

 When I get to the login screen (and it takes a while to get there...), it sometimes wont let me type my password anywhere. Other times, it shows the password textbox, but wont let me type. Any ideas?

 Running 10.10, my laptop fan seems to be a bit louder than when I ran windows
 At an interval of about 30 seconds, my computer fan seems to increase in volume and intensity, lasting for 2-3 seconds. Running 10.10... This has happened on most other linuxes that I have tried on this computer. Anything I can do about it?
 So, my laptop (toshiba) is running extremely hot, at about 94C. Any ideas for fixing this?
 packages?
 Will it monitor it, or solve it tho?
 Rather than installing more system monitor tools, does anyone have a fix for it overheting?
