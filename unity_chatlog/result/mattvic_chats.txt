 Hello, after installing 11.04, my broadcom wireless stopped working. lspci -> broadcom BCM43225, STA drivers installed, in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf if I add "blacklist acer-wmi", I can see the wireless services around me, but I cannot connect to them.  Please help!
 opera is not bad

 mtlife, try "metacity --replace" in a terminal
 mtlife, do you use compiz?
 try typing ccsm in a terminal
 mtlife, any luck with "ccsm" in a terminal?

 mtlife, yes, the command is "sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager"
 mtlife, I just did something weird, did you say something recently?
 hello, serene
 anyone know a good irc client?  I'm using ircii and it's pretty fail
 mylife. go to "Window Decorator".  Are you using 11.04. or 10.10?

 xchat!  that's the one mint have.  I like that one
 mtlife, one moment please, I need to check something
 mtlife: under the "Window Decorator" plugin, what does the line "Command:" say?
 soothsayer:  sper user is known as "root"
 mylife:  hmmm... okay.  We can brute force it by adding a new startup application.  Hold on.
 mtlife: go to system -> preferences -> startup applications.  Once there, click add, name it "Start my Window Decorator" and put as the command "/usr/bin/compiz-decorator --replace"
 Unity is crap.  Dunno what they are thinking
 mtlife, I'm not sure - it must be something when you messed around with the other window manager
 trine:  indeed, it's terrible
 mtlife, possibly, I'm not sure.  I have never used lubuntu.  I would have assumed switching sessions would keep your window decorators though
 mrlife, oh!  it might be that you are still on the lubuntu theme.  try going to system -> preferences -> appearance and selecting a theme there
 mtlife, the lubuntu window decorator might have been uninstalled when you dist-upgraded
 11.04 is alpha
 ubuottu: I'm aware what the official release is.  It just runs like an alpha.
 mtlife alrighty.  well after adding that startup application, try logging out and in again
 mtlife: have you installed all the drivers?  Unity is bad, and your graphics card needs to have OpenGL support
 mtlife: Unity made some poor design choices in my opinion, but I don't really know how to get it working if it isn't already
 mtlife, I'm switching to xchat.  My name is FizzixNerd now
