 how is the new beast
 any first takes on 11.04?
 if i upgrade from 10.10, besides backups, does it preserve my current home folder, custom directories and games I've copied?
 mnoyce - still have to turn off compiz to play fps's well?
 ..or drop the effects to basic
 cool, thanks mnoyce
 backintime is very cool, hope i wont have to learn how to restore from it with the upgrade 99
 what's the terminal irc client in case i have issues?
 ty
 Monotoko - X-plane is best commercial one
 err.. mac is too much linux clone
 no, mac is like linux
 what's wrong with that tyhpoon, there's a reason macs are expensive besides greedy executives
 and windows 9 copies chrome, then years later buys the patents and tries to stiffle competition
 :) i dont mind great ideas being shared, just dont go patent trolling
 that being said, i'm still on 10.10
 ubuntu is smart for wanting to spread to devices they can profit from, good for them
 try gnome-classic on a pad
 i'll have to close my mouth until i can upgrade
 looking at screenshots, how in any way does it copy a mac??!?
 locked in? if developers would write BF4 for it like they do with the current pc platforms, it would be worth it
 anyone not have troubles with 11.04, upgrade go smooth as silk?
 as long as the gui doesn't cramp my FPS-game playing ways, i'll be fine with 11.04
 in the upgrade, will my wireless networking/WPA password need to be reentered?
 tase - try backintime, it's in repos
 lnfr4nk7 - think it's a love/hate relationship
 sudo chown -R folder name.name  ?
 so i upgraded to 11.04, then installed unity 2d. when i try to play urban terror or openarena, my mouse wraps around the screen, like it's in a limited work area.
 i dont mind the change in looks, but seems to be messing with my gaming
 anyone know why my mouse wants to recenter on 3d games?
 i find it weird each focused window's menu goes to the top of the bar, whatever it is called
 clutter and unclutter are causing issues with mouse and FPS games, i'm killing 'unclutter'
 find the 2d interface kind of neat, opengl windowed games play better in 2d
 someday will have live-preview of workspaces :P
