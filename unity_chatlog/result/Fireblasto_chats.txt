 Hi, I've recently upgraded to ubuntu 11.04 on my netbook, and I am liking the new user interface, especially on my smaller screen. However, is there any way of changing the panel's position at the top to the bottom?

 LAcan, I've tried the original method of how you would sort the panel positions, but when I right click the panel, there is no menu popping up. I'm using the new unity interface.
 cheapie, well that just sucks then, I'm really digging the new interface but certain aspects are really letting me down.
 cheapie, yeah, hopefully it will be made better!
 doc-saintly, the normal keys used are the up and down arrows? Just like windows.
 doc-saintly :) If you are using a IRC client though, the up and down arrows actually select the lines that you already posted. Additionally, you can use the page up and page down keys for greater distances
