 hi
 can I trust Computer Janitor?
 will remove all UNNECESSARY packages?
 how can i do that, jatt? and what about the "apt-get autoremove" command?
 stop that, paranox
 when i put "deborphan" in terminal, i get a list of packages, this tool just finds the orphaned packages for me?
 they were all given the Abort choice, jrib
 can i do "wc" on a .odt document?
 i can :)
 how do i use "SCP" if the source is my machine's home folder, and the destination is a server's root home folder?
 is there an "easy" GUI CVS that you know of?
 because "man cvs" is causing me nightmares
 maybe you haven't identified your nickname, phibxr
 oh
 i am doing that now already, lcb
 thanks
 lcb, there is CVS and Subversion, and Subversion is NOT a CVS?
 is CVS a brand? lcb
 sure there are garbages, lcb..that's why autoremove and deborphan are there :P
 anyone use TKCVS?
 i have no idea what to enter in "Module" when specifying the CVSROOT
 TKCVS is good, lcb? or my question? :P
 ok lcb
 great news, engammalsko
 there is one girl on the interwebs.

 is there a good query builder that you know of?
