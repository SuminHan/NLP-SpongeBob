 Hi guys. I just upgraded to 11.04 but I don't like unity. How can I start Gnome again?
 Axlin, I cannot select anything at the bottom of the login-screen as I used to
 usalabs, thanks, that must do it :)
 Hi guys. I want to grep something a match the word "Ring" followed by a whitespace. grep 'Ring\s' is not working. What should I use?
 jrib, thank you it worked :)
