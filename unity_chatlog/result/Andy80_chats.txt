 hello
 txomon, A_J what?! I just said hello :D
 a quick question: which package does contain the Natty's battery applet? I need to report a bug on it but I don't know package name....
 vish: yeah, the problem is that I see TWO lines with battery info and then "Preferences" when I click on the icon :) so... it's a  gnome-power-manager bug or a indicator's one?
