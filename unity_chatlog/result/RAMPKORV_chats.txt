 Hello people. I just ran the upgrade to 11.04 from 10.10. First thing I'm noticing is that X just froze. I'm not sure how to resolve it. Is this a common issue?
 I'm chatting from console now with irssi
 jiltdil: I mean, I run irssi as my IRC client, as X doesn't seem to work
 I have only ran the upgrade to 11.04 and now X doesn't work
 If nobody has any idea - how do I kill X so I can reinstall my NVIDIA driver - because it's still running, just not working
 Thanks
 MEh. The NVIDIA driver doesn't even install on Ubuntu 11. Nothing seems to work except console
 I will probably end up rreformatting and install 10.10
 tripelb: yea, I had big trouble with the upgrade to 10.10 too. No X and no audio
 ohsix: where is it located
 ohsix: thanks
 Alright. Renamed it to xorg.conf.old. Now it's reboot time
 Amazing. It worked. Just have to fix multiple monitors, then get on to whatever other problems there may be
 snopp
 The problem I had was that Xinerama doesn't seem to work in Unity
 So I'm using Twinview, but full-sceen apps don't work so well
 ohsix, when playing games in Fullscreen, I get a fullscreen across two 16:9 screens, which isn't so pretty
 :D
 But I'm not really doing it much, so
 ohsix, aye
 I hope it does Geforce 210 well
 bah, I hate when Unity's window buttons disappear so you can't move or close your program
