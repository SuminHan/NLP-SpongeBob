 Minor question.... What are some good, _tested_, and stable programs for burning DVD+Rs?
 afroman you guys need a good memory scrubber? I have one, if you're interested...
 Does anyone know, can Brasero burn DVD+Rs compatible with consumer DVD players? If not, what's a program that can?
 Dasy2k1 I'm just checking here, I don't want to waste any of these
 ncg sure go ahead! It's why we're here
 So, has anyone had any experiences with Brasero messing up DVD+R, making it incompatible?
 ohsix none yet, fingers crossed I won't. I just have a _very_ limited supply of DVD+R discs, and I don't want to waste any that I don't have to... and I make disco balls out of my ruined discs...
 ohsix thanks, I'll keep that in mind!
 Ivan96485, what was he using? Openoffice has a recover function
 amorton OO periodically saves it to a temporary file in case there's a fatal error
