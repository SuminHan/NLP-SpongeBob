 hi! is it possible to tell update-manager to download the packages for upgrading to natty now, and then use them to do the upgrade later?

 hi! I'm trying to upgrade, but when I click upgrade in the update manager, it just goes grey, freezes, and then says "could not download release notes"
 is the server down?
 JohnFlux: are you also in GB, by any chance?
 I suppose it must be the gb server
 maybe I'll try another one
 hi! I hope someone can help me: I'm at my wits end. I have a dell e6510 and my touchpad is driving me crazy. it is one of the new touchpads that isn't recognised as a touchpad by the kernel, and so I can't use synclient to disable the touchpad while typing, basically making typing impossible. I've googled and googled, and there are a million different bugzilla/launchpad threads, but I can't actually find a solution! can anyone pleas
 e help?
 stefg: I have not, I'll do that now
 but I don't think it will work, because nothing "synaptics" has worked
 I don't think the touchpad is recognised as having anything to do with "synaptics"
 stefg: that askubuntu is how to disable it completely: but what if I don't have another mouse?
 stefg: I want instead to have it recognised as a touchpad by the system
 stefg: so that it can be disabled while typing
 this is really awful
 it makes the whole computer unusable when you can't fecking type :-(
