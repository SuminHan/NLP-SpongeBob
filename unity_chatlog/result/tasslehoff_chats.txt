 I'm running 11.04 on a MacBook Pro (with norwegian layout). Out of the box the modifier keys (ctrl, alt, shift, cmd) work like they should for launcher, unity and workspaces, but I can't get to the symbols I get in osx with shift-cmd-<number-key>.
 VCoolio: the ones I miss most are square and curly brackets. hard to program without them. is that unicode symbols?
 VCoolio: layout -> options -> key to choose 3d level -> any alt key = problem fixed :)
 VCoolio: no... then the desktop switching stopped working... argh.
 anyone running ubuntu on a macbook pro that can tell me how they choose 3d level on the keyboard?
 which gmail indicator/notifier is a good choice in 11.04?
 Used checkgmail before, but wonder if there is anything better out there
 Barridus: I don't want a client, just a notifier.
 KM0201: yeah. have used gmail-notify and checkgmail, but wonder if there are any indicator applet notifiers
 I'm struggling to get my MacBook Pro keyboard layout right. Shift, Alt & Cmd keys work out of the box, but I have no way to choose 3d level, which I need to get curly/square brackets.
 If I choose "left alt and win is swapped" in layout options, Cmd starts working as Alt, and Shift + Cmd gives me 3d level. Alt does not, however, start to function as Cmd did.
 is it possible to have Alt choosing 3d level, and still have Ctrl + Alt combos work?
 Ubuntu is close to excellent on my MacBook Pro, but the Norwegian Layout is wrong. Which forum/channel should I post/talk to if I want to help this? Don't think I have the time/skills to do it on my own, but I can at least describe what's wrong :)
 kezzawd: 6.2
 is there a way to toggle the meaning of the fn button?
 is ~/.Xmodmap used by Ubuntu?
 hm. I don't like that shotwell started creating a library from the Pictures folder even before I had told where I wanted it to look..
 ActionParsnip: Could be. I'll delete the config dir and start over
 ActionParsnip: starting it again, it begins "updating library", though I haven't added any pictures. it doesn't show any pictures either, so I`m not sure what it is doing :)
 Do any themes for 11.04 also work on launcher/dash/panel? none of the ones I've tried so far change the look of those.
 Dr_Willis: ok.
 One cannot run Gnome 3 and Unity side by side on 11.04, right?
 Any way to get gmail notifications from the indicator applet?
