 nadien: scroll to the section about the firefox menu button
 nadien: it will be in the panel if you are using Unity
 nadien: If you are using Unity, then the menu option should be in the panel (the very top of the screen), otherwise I don't know what to tell you.
 nadien: Unity is the desktop environment that is default in Ubuntu version 11.04
 nadien: Unity is the default desktop environment, however if you do not like it, select Ubuntu Classic Desktop at the login screen
 skulltip-  I think he was just picking at the Linux != full OS point
 zvacet-  you can upgrade from CD now
 Galvatron-  All OS' copy other OS'
 Galvatron-  In different ways. It's healthy competition.
 zvacet-  one second

 zvacet: I assume if the disk can't read your current installation for whatever reason then you will not see the option on the screen I sent you.
 zvacet: that would be likely.
 zvacet-  I haven't touched a 11.04 CD yet so I wouldn't know
 zvacet-  I'm not sure, I haven't tried it, but I could see that being a problem.
 bittyx-laptop-  yup
 bittyx-laptop-  no problem. Give Unity a try though before returning to Gnome-Classic. It's not for everyone yet, but you might like it.
 Soothsayer-  I don't beleive so
 KMFrog-  Unity works in the newest version of Virtualbox, but not the version from the Ubuntu repository
 zrogg-  do you mean the menus normally in the top left?
 zrogg - The new desktop for Ubuntu 11.04 looks fairly different from 10.10
 zrogg-  Try clicking the Ubuntu logo in the top left, should bring up the Dash
 zrogg - there is a guide here http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/natty/ if your desktop doesn't have the things mentioned in this guide then there might be a problem
 zrogg - tried logging in and out? or restarting?
 zrogg - thats odd
 zrogg - Sorry I'm not too sure what to advise, I haven't started using 11.04 yet, I just know what it's supposed to look like
 zrogg-  Best of luck
 I can also attest to having problems with direct upgrades.
 rafii-  That's good to hear. I was just remarking that typically I find clean installations to be more reliable.
 rafi - I would agree with that statement. However I remember my upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10 was when I had nothing configured special and that broke hard. Luck of the draw I suspect
