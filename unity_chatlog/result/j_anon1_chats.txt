 How do I access an external device in Narwhal?
 External drive, i mean.
 How do I access a usb drive in Narwhal?
 ActionParsnip, it is plugged in, but then what? There's no "Places" in the taskbar and "files and folders" just includes Downloads, Music, etc.
 and it's not displayed on the desktop
 I didn't last use it on that computer. This is the first time I have plugged it in.
 what's SUPPOSED to happen in narwhal?
 Should Narwhal be showing my external drive on the desktop and when i click Files and Folders?
 Considering it is recognized in the GNOME version
