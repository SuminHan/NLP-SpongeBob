 hi all.... does anyone know how to change the default unity shortcut? i dont want the super + f1 key to open the menu panel... I also dont want the super + t key to open the trash can.....:( i cant seem to find the way to change this behaviour anywhere
 jaypur: i'm using 64 bit
 jaypur: not yet.... but i've just upgraded about 3 hours ago
 KNUBBIG: i assume you are referring to the 'commands' section there?
 KNUBBIG : nope.... i bound super + t to run gnome-terminal... but it still opens the trash can :(
 KNUBBIG: plugin? where can i get that?
 jaypur: nope
 KNUBBIG: i think unity has just crashed on me..
 KNUBBIG: hmmm...back
 anyone know how to change the unity shortcut? (alt-f1 & super-t in particular)
 has anyone tried unity2d ? I cant seem to make it to have multiple workspace..... when i click the workspace switcher, only one is shown (top left)... the rest are dark :(
 anyone has used unity 2d before?
