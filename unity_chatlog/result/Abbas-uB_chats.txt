 hey guys
 i'm a new convert
 from win7 to ub
 i'm loving the UI
 for 11.04
 why do certain things like updates download so slow?
 just found my way around pidgin :p
 ah
 i'll wait then i guess
 my browsing is perfect
 and i love how smooth and sweet the browsing/fonts etc are
 my bad, i'll leave you to work now.
