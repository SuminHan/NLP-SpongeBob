 If I upgrade to Ubuntu 11.04 will it remove my custom desktop(gnome panels with plasma work area) and switch it to unity?
 leoechevarria, try logging out and when at login screen usually at the bottom you can select your desktop environment after clicking your name
 leoechevarria, since 9.10 mine autologins to last session
 leoechevarria, I would think so but I have a kustom Gnome desktop so I havent used unity at all
 uberfrau, under view you should have "show hidden files"
 uberfrau, you selected it?
 leoechevarria, I am looking at it on http://scottlinux.com/2011/03/05/ubuntu-11-04-change-from-unity-to-classic-gnome/ link there
 leoechevarria, well I am going to start the upgrade now and I will be albe to tell you for sure soon
 leoechevarria, or you may hear me cussing at my computer from anyplace in the world..... ;)
 leoechevarria, I want to make the upgrade anyway but dual screens make upgrading a pain at times
 leoechevarria, check your proprietary drivers
 leoechevarria, did you check your proprietary drivers?
 leoechevarria, they are usualy disabled on upgrade
 leoechevarria, ok sounds like you have the correct drivers then and they are enabled
 leoechevarria, unity may have a small glitch on your system
 leoechevarria, well I am doing my upgrade now so I hope some luck fallows me today
 I have a Gnome-plasma hybrid desktop on one screen and a standard Gnome on my TV so I hope it doesnt go all "funny" on me
 leoechevarria,  ty for the luck wishes
 mastaofdisasta, it should just work as a regular keyboard
 mastaofdisasta, the backlighting is usualy done with an led that is built in and needs no drivers
 mastaofdisasta, have you tried it on ubuntu yet?
 mastaofdisasta, mu backlit 10key pad worked right out of the box
 sly what kind of laptop is this? make/model
 sly I am not finding known issues for your laptop but have you checked your sound settings?
 sly sorry I am late to the conversation reading up it seems escot has you where I was going to send you
 sly stick with escot he is pretty good with laptop stuff he has helped me in the past
