 I have an odd problem. I have a Logitech illuminated keyboard, logitech g500 mouse, and logitech c310 webcam. All USB. When I use the webcam on 2.6.38-8-generic,  my keyboard will usually stop working after a few minutes, but the mouse and webcam still work fine. No errors in syslog or messages. Any ideas?

 Has anyone had problems when using a webcam? My USB keyboard will stop working when I use my webcam but the USB mouse works fine.
 escott, yes. All 3 in same USB and different USB busses.
 escott, I believe it was still listed in lsusb. It completely freezes up and the only way i can get to work again is to reboot. Ive tailed all the logs I could think of to see if anything errored and found nothing.
 escott, It use to work fine on an earlier version of the kernel (wish I remembered which version it was). I think updating caused the problem.
 escott, By the time I realized it stopped working, I could only go 1 version back and it still didnt work. I suppose something else could have been updated at the same time I did the kernel update that may have also been the culprit.
 Chipzzz, No. Everything is directly to the MB. I've also tried to move things to different groups on the MB to see if that was causing the issue.
 Is there anyway to remove/reinstall the USB drivers for the keyboard and webcam?
 I think ill try a live CD and if that doesnt have the problem, a fresh install may fix the issue.
