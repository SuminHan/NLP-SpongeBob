 I get this warning when running sensors-detect from lm-sensors: Warning: the required module sbs is not currently installed .... I can't find sbs anywhere, and googling isn't much help... any ideas?
 lavanyadeepak: put in the CD and change the source, but you have to go through 10.10, can't do it directly
 anyone know how to get the sbs module loaded for lm-sensors, or what it is exactly? I have the same problem as http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1537746
 edbian: doesn't do anthing, modprobe -l doesnt show it, locate doesn't show it...
 edbian: but modprobe -l should show it, shouldn't it??
 edbian: nope, shows nothing
 edbian: get gkrellm to show all the sensors that are in the computer ...
 edbian: shows quite a few sensors that the sensors command shows as well
 edbian: ok, thanks all the same... there's no answer in #linux-sensors which is the lm-sensors channel here
 meraqlix: no. sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop could do it
 Master starting with ubuntu is not bad, easy to install, fairly stable, and you can always dig into the internals as much as you like
 AMAG: I had some other stuff installed (nvidia drivers iirc) that I had to uninstall to get the GL based stuff to work properly... maybe you have something installed you don't need and that's being used?
 Amag no idea either, i went through the packages that were installed and renoved the xserver-* packages I didn't need and also the nvidia stuff since i have intel chipset
