 hey fellas, i got an ubuntu box (through Linode) and it keeps randomly getting stuck at 100% cpu usage (400% actually?). i am unable to pull up the site , or access the console (via putty) the only way to fix it is to log into the linode web manager and reboot it.
 what are some things i could do to diagnose this
 i believe so yes incarus6
 problem is.. i cant get in via console
 so i cannot run top
 so. the problem occurs.. i get notification from linode
 website is down. console is down
 i reboot from web ui
 but i cant troubleshoot the cause
 its on a vps at linode , i dont know the specs
 yah i am askign there. doesnt look like anyone knows how to go back and diagnose it
 is there any way to log cpu usages and memory usage?
 at least temporarily?
 ok jhw, i will look at that
 will sysstat use up alot of resources
