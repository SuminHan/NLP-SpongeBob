 Hey what is the key combo to grep for a tab ?
 i.e.
 grep "something[TAB]bleh"
 FLeiXiuS, that's what I thought - hmmm...
 trae, Why do you say that?  You only need icons on the launcher if that's all you want,
 trae, Click the ubuntu icon in the top left, search for your app, and then click & drag it to the panel...
 trae, To customize it further, right click ti.
 trae, Oh hmmm
 trae, The other option is to create a folder of custom launchers in your home folder.
 trae, And then link those to your unity panel
 trae, suffice it to say: http://i.imgur.com/zdIIa.png
 lcb, Hah!
 trae, I have a feeling the customization of Unity will be a big player in 11.10 - it's silly that you have to install ccsm just to adjust Unity's panel
 ActionParsnip, What's wrong with what?
 trae, If you want to run Gnome - you can do so... simply select "Gnome Desktop" on the login screen...
 trae, No need to force yourself to use it unless you like it.
 ActionParsnip, Lots of wasted space...  :)
 trae, Hah!  Sounds good
 phibxr, I like Unity too - I'm mostly hoping that they nail it the second time around in 11.10 with configuration options.  :)
 trae, ohsix yeah and the review process even involved a vote to back off Unity till 11.10
 zombor, GO AWAY
 zombor, SUDO RM -RF /

 zizban, I'm running Classic Gnome on 11.04 - would that still affect it?  Also - POS unity...  >_<
 blink, Have you tried choosing "Classic Ubuntu" in the gnome login manager... ??  Gnome should have already been installed w/ your upgrade.
