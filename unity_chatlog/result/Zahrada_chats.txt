 I tried booking this band, but for some absolutely bonkers reason, they're not within my budget range: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0
 I mispasted IdleOne.
 It's true though. I'm part of a ngo that's organising a music festival in my local town...

 At least till the release of 11.04 later this day, it uses gnome :P
 I've had some issues while installing natty 64bit.
 When the installation process comes about to install GRUB, it fails.
 It simply states that it cannot install it.
 I must add that I tried installing it on a RAID 0
 I switched back to 10.10 [4-tea-2]
 and then upgraded that one to 11.04.
 it's all fine and dandy now, [4-tea-2].
 is there a good tool to modify grub for ubuntu?
 Well, that's the kind I hope to avoid :P
