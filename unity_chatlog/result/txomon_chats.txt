 KNUBBIG, you have to press ALT (in gnome 3)
 Andy80, oki
 KNUBBIG, ah ok
 KNUBBIG, pressing a button in gnome is not the same as putting a command in terminal (really yes, but it isn't managed in same way) shutdown
 KNUBBIG, try looking in what that button calls

 scorch2, could be

 Toph, more efficiency also
 Toph, but it is a problem for packages, most of them are done for 32 bits
 Toph, depending of what you are going to use the computer, maybe, looking forward compability, stay in 32bit
 Toph, in every way, the only way it is not, is when you dont have a program for 64 bits (few ones, but could be)
