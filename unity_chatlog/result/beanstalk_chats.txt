 I'm trying to upgrade from 10.04 to 11.04, so I have to first upgrade to 10.10, but I get the error E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks. How should I fix this?
 Is anyone else updating from 10.04 to 11.04?
 Rather, is there any way to disable third-party packages temporarily?
 zvacet: what do I select now?
 zvacet: I don't have any of those
 zvacet: it said that might be the problem for "E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks" but I guess that's not it
 zvacet: I get the same error :(
 zvacet: yep
 zvacet: actually, I'm on Lucid Lynx
 10.04 lts
 zvacet: I'm trying to update to 10.10 so I can then update to 11.04
 zvacet: nope
 ZykoticK9: I've already changed the setting to let it go to 10.10
 (non-lts
 )
 zvacet: I have a netbook, so I can't use a CD
 DasEi: let me see
 DasEi: that's just the normal update manager
 DasEi: I know how to upgrade
 but now it's saying it's a release candidate
 it says 10.10
 DasEi: that was to you :P
 zvacet: I'm trying to.
 DasEi, zvacet: I've already set it to do that. I pressed the button to upgrade to 10.10. That's what's giving me "E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks."
 DasEi: yes. I've installed all the latest updates.
 DasEi: I'll try
 zvacet: what does that do?
 oh ok
 I get the error "E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks" during the second step of upgrading. Any ideas on how to fix it?
 DasEi: what's single mode? I've already repaired broken packages. and how do I choose another server? :P
 How do I remove or unhold "held packages?" It's preventing me from upgrading
 bastidrazor: thanks, I'll take a look
 bastidrazor: except it doesn't say how to find out which packages are being held. do you know how to do that?
 How do I find out which packages on my system are being held?
 bastidrazor: I can't upgrade my system and a message pops up saying that an error is being caused likely by held packages
 I found a forum post saying that if I remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau, but I don't know if that'll be bad for my system; how can I tell if the package is being used?
 I just updated my netbook to 11.04 but now I'm dropped automatically in the command line without going to the graphical login screen. How do I fix this?
 phed: "fatal server error: no screens found"
 phed: how should I fix it?
 phed: I'm trying your first suggestion
 phed: the first one works, I think :)
