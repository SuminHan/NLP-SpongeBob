 Angelic, maybe you accidentally turned of wireless by means of fn+f2 or a switch/button on the side?
 ray24, what message do you het?
 ray24, what command/program are you using?
 ray24, never done it like that, is the disk unmounted? I always use gparted
 ray24, , is the disk unmounted?
 ray24, easy answer: use gparted, unmount the drive and repartition/format
 yeah, figured that much
 ray24, you could cd to the drive and type "sudo chown -R yourusername" (make sure you have backups of all your data 1st)
 ray24, otherwise try gparted
 ray24, good!
 glad it worked out
 comthre3, you do have a static IP address?
 ports forwarded on router? Firewalls? firestarter/ufw?
 tried alternate ports? 16881-16891 instead of 6881-6891
 hmm, that's ermm not good
 shouldn't need root priviliges
 probably will work as "normal" user now too
 try removing your config files as root and fire up as normal user afterwards then I'd guess
 unless transmission is still running as root?
 tray?
 comthre3, weird, sounded like your config files were owned by root but O.K. Cool I guess :)
 comthre3, but if you start it from terminal it doesn't display any errors?
 o.k. nothing to worry about then I guess
