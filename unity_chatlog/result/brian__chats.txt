 pfifo: I'm glad you pointed his advice out. I cannot keep up with the traffic here. :)
 ubottu: me too! It saves me from reinstalling and having to figure out the whole rpm thing. :D
 Hey
 Anyone know how to switch from the GRUB bootloader back to the Windows bootloader?
 Well
 I have it installed via wubi
 escott: I want the mbr, not the grub.  I have 2 Ubuntu partitions(I know, I had some issues)  One partition is from the wubi one is from a CD.  I want to get rid of one of them.
