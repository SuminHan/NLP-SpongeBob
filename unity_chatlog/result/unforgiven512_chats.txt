 I can not get my wifi to work on my laptop. I have the driver enabled in "Restricted Drivers" correctly. I've rebooted multiple times. I've tried disabling, rebooting, re-enabling, rebooting. I've tried '$ sudo rfkill unblock all", no luck.
 It shows up under '$ lspci' as 03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 01)
 lo and eth0, no wlan0
 It worked fine under 10.10, I did a full wipe and fresh install, btw
 ayrton: At login, please select ubuntu classic
 hiexpo: lsmod returns wl and lib80211, I think there should be ssb, mac80211, and cfg80211, perhaps?
 hiexpo: not there
 bcm203x, bcm3510, bcm5974, bcm63xx, bcm_wimax
 hiexpo: I don't understand. I installed the driver from "restricted drivers", it worked totally fine, out of box on Ubuntu 10.10. Taking a step backwords, are we?
 hiexpo: I am on 11.04, yes. But, why is there a regression from 10.10?
 hiexpo: I'll probably just tinker with it more, and see if Ic an fix it.
 Figured out my wlan issues, switched from wl to b43, works fine now :)
 Is there a known solution or workaround for the "deadzone" in the middle of my screen (using Ubuntu 11.04)?
