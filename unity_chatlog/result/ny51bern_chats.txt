 Can someone help me install ubuntu 11?
 a2c4n9e1: ive already gotten pretty far, but the installer has prompted me asking "What do you want to do about modified configuration file grub?"
 a2c4n9e1: theres a bunch. "install the package maintainer's version" "keep the local version currently installed" "show the differences between the versions" "show a 3 way diff b/w available versions" "do a 3 way merge b/w avail versions (experimental)" "start a new shell to examine the situation"
 a2c4n9e1: I have no idea what those links mean. I'm pretty dumb when it comes to these things..
 lcb: you got any ideas for me? a2c4 credited you with 2 links but idk what they mean
 lcb: I'm not sure what GRUB i have
 lcb: i think I have grub 2, they only lst 1.99
 lcb: i really am not sure what to do..
 lcb:  theres a help button on the dialog when it asks me to choose that says " a new version of config file /etc/default/grub is avail, but the version installed has been locally modified
 lcb: that help?
 lcb: any ideas?
 lcb: theres no option to update..?
 lcb: is that "install the package maintainer's version"
