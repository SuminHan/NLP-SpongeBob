 Hi, I reinstalled my laptop with ubuntu 11.04, since that I cannot export displays from a server to my screen, how can I fix that? The error on the remote host is "Cannot open display". I did run "xhost +" on my localhost
 sje2: from a linux server
 like I did yesterday with DISPLAY:myIP:0 application

 I changed the ForwardX11 to yes, but that did not help
 @sjcherbak, I cannot change the server
 no i don't, I also did not use it before I switched to 11.04
 it has something to do with my computer not allowing to accept the export display, but on 10.04 I had a graphical interface to accept this , but I don't find it in 11.04
 shcherbak: indeed, that will do the trick?
 sherbak: I found this which seems very related: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm/+bug/498434
 ubottu: yes, that might be my issue, I will need to create the custom.conf file?
 shcherbak: I just reinstalled it and it is not working since :D
 shcherbak, I created the file and will perform a restart of gdm to see if this helped me
 shcherbak: after the restart my issue is resolved! thanks for the inputs
