 Hey there - I upgraded to 11.04 and have dual monitors - however I can't move a window from one monitor to another
 When I drag the window to the side to move to another monitor it resizes to half the screen size - Windows 7 style
 Unity - sorry should have mentioned that
 MustardCU1, Unity - sorry should have mentioned that
 MustardCU1, crud - yeah so far I dont think I will either :-/
 However I have another issue - my wireless cards download speed is brutally slow - but upload speed is fine
 Any ideas as to why my wireless download is so poor but upload is fine?
 It was working just fine on 10.10
