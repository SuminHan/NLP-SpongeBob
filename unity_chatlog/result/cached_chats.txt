 Who's the brain box who decided I don't want a task bar any more?
 And how do I get it back?
 Stereocaulon_: How do I do that?
 MK``: Yes
 Stereocaulon_: Fixed. Thanks!
 Whoever decided that this interface is better needs to read up on "usability"
 Is there any chance Ubuntu will be switching back to GNOME? I don't think I can recommend it as a useful distro for beginners as long as Unity is the default UI
 ohsix: they effectively did, UI-wise
 ohsix: either way, it's a terrible design
 ohsix: I was asking if there's a chance it'll switch back or not. I'm wondering if I should just start completely ignoring Ubuntu from now on or not.
 ohsix: I wasn't asking for specific help
 ohsix: I'm aware, but it looks like I can't be recommending Ubuntu from now on to people who will be asking both me and others for help. Maybe Fedora's the way to go
 kyubutsu: kyuubi42?
 Is the point of that floodbot just to have us spam #freenode, or is it that someone will impersonate an admin on there and try to steal passwords?
 what's with #ubuntu-unregged? was there a spambot attack?
 LjL:but i haven't joined for over 4 hours
