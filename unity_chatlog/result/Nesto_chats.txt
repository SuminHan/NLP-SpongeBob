 Hey guys, I was wonder if I could get some help real quick.... I have a Win7 desktop, and a ubuntu desktop (11.04) that I want to use as a printer server, but right now I'm trying to remote into the ubuntu desktop but I can't. I can remote into my windows from the ubuntu desktop but not the other way around. I have tried quite a few tuts i found online but to no avail...
 rgr, firestarter?
 rgr, I tried out remote desktop, vnc, and thats about it
 ohsix,  I did enable remote access
 ohsix, I used remote desktop buit into windows and vnc viewer
 ohsix: i don't know, I just downloaded something from their website
 ohsix: Yes, from realvnc
 ohsix: i set a password, but not to ask when someone connects
 ohsix: how do you use vino
 ohsix, I'm trying to remote from windows 7 to ubuntu
 I don't want to use teamviewer... I want to access my computer over my network, not my internet
 ohsix: I did do that... but still nothing....  :/
 hmmm.... really ZenGuy311? I shall try that out instead
 ah ok ohsix, well I can probably figure the team viewer part myself... anyways thanks ohsix
 ohsix, i think that it's something with my network
 ohsix, yea vnc says error connecting
 ohsix, also, for some reason my laptop get's really really slow download speeds
 it seems   to be an asus/ubuntu problem
 ohsix, let me get on my laptop real quick
 ohsix, I think so... cuz a quite a few Asus people seem to be having the same problem
 ohsix: I figured out the problem...  -__-
 ohsix: For some reason I was putting a 2 as the last number for my host, instead of putting what it actually was... a 9
