 So i was running the 11.04 beta release, and when i try and to an update, it says I can only do a partial upgrade? And that doesn't even seem to work...Am i not able to update via update-manager?
 Has anyone been able to upgrade to the 11.04 release from the 11.04 beta release through update-manager??
 That is what I have been doing
 coz_, Its saying I can only do a partial upgrade?
 coz_, Yeah, I guess that is the same problem I am having, it won't let me upgrade anything :D
 coz_, E:Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages. <-- error I am getting when trying to update
 ImperialXT, ppa's?
 coz_, Okay thanks, ill try again
 ImperialXT, okay thank you
 I am using Natty, and for some reason I can't seem to find/get working lib32ncurses5-dev,is32-libs,lib32readline5-dev, or lib32z-dev? On 10.10 or 10.04 I was able to just apt-get install them but not on natty?
 I had a lot of problems and when I was updating to 11.04 something messed up and everything broke and I couldnt get anything to work. So i deleted it and reinstalled 10.04...now I can't get my computer to recognize my wireless internet card. Its a BCM4311 and I know how to set it up, but it won't even see it under lspci?
 ActionParsnip, Is there a reason my computer won't recognize my wireless card anymore?
 ActionParsnip, Nope, just my direct connection
 ActionParsnip, I had to partition everything myself when reinstalling because 11.04 was on there and i had to delete that and format the partition, I set the mount point at / for 10.04, would that mess anything up?
 ActionParsnip, there is a button on the laptop, but ive hit it several times and nothing ;/
 ActionParsnip, nope, no wireless card was detected
 ActionParsnip, Maybe i will download natty onto a cd and perform a clean install and try again ugh
 ActionParsnip, yes lucid, it has always worked before also
 ActionParsnip, yep, maybe this button needs to be pressed on startup or something, ill mess around with it ;) Thanks anyways
 ActionParsnip, I got it working now ;D I booted into windows, turned the wireless on, then booted back into linux and it worked.
 Can someone tell me what the difference between update-manager and sudo apt-get update is? when i run the apt-get command it just says done, but when i use update-manager it has tons of stuff that i need to update
 im getting 20mb/sec eh
 kb/sec i mean lol
 Ubuntu_user, I meant kb/sec
 cholo, why is that?
 Ubuntu_user, I have my computer partitioned with windows 7 and ubuntu
 I did a full install from boot off the cd, completely separate from windows
