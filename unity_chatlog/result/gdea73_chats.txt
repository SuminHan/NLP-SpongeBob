 Hi, need help badly...
 Having really weird keyboard input errors
 When I boot up, it goes to GRUB menu. but every key except the arrow keys work
 when I select ubuntu 10.10 (because that's all I can select), it gives me an error...
 Anyone willing to help? I get error: out of disk upon boot.
 gartral: yes. I get three lines of error, I will send them to you in PM
 ok...
 gartral: http://pastebin.com/69iNq0xR
 and pressing any key does nothing. I have to ctrl + alt + delete or use the reset button.
 SAMSUNG 1TB
 samsung spinpoint f3 1tb, is all I remember...
 SMART attributes seemed fine. Though, I will note, I've had several failed Ubuntu installs with errno 5
 (usually corrected by burning the CD at 4x)
 escott: I am not sure how to do that... the partition was formatted as ext4, that's all I know.
 gartral: Yes, I just installed this morning :P
 gartral: I'v been having some really odd issues lately, ...
 and no, there are only 2 partitions
 they are both ext4, the second one is backup.
 gartral: Yes, I did configure them manually. I told it to format partition one (then 11.04 which I didn't like), to ext4, and install the bootloader to /dev/sda1 (partition 1).
 escott: oh. so I have to reformat using sda
 escott: I thought I could put the boot loader on that partition, I'm not sure exactly why I wanted to but ...
 gartral: also having GRUB issues. my arrow keys don't work. they come up as letters, P, H, W or something.
 okay, thanks.
 bye
