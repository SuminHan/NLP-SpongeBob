 I having trouble with my wacom tablet in 11.04, I can't work it out, seems all pressure sensitivity is gone, apart from slighting on and completely ON.. i've tried uninstalling all drivers that i can find in synaptic, restarting, etc.. is there some problem I not know about?
 does anyone on 11.04 have Wacom tablet working correctly?
 oky it seems people who having installed fresh 11.04 rather than upgrading from 10.10 are not experiencing problems with tablet sensitivity and such, anyone know where I might start to fix the problems I'm having without a full re-install?
 Halzen, new kernel arrived today via synaptic, it hasn't cured problem
 Halzen, thanks, but I dont fancy having to go throught the thing of also compiling kernel modules for video card and such ideally
 Halzen, it must be something to do with X configuration though, to be honest, perhaps I can just kinda reset everything
 Halzen, perhaps I will try that, you've given me idea to have a go with first though, and that is to try removing video card drivers, reset X and start over with that
 Halzen, cheers. I bookmark your link for sure
 see you on the other side
