 My dad is getting a ubi-partman error when attempting to install ubuntu x64 11.04 final, any help?   ... not the best first impression... :(
 mordof: ubi-partman exit code 141, on the screen after the checklist
 mordof: mobo is gigabyte: p67a-ud7-b3
 ahhhhhhhhhh wtf.
 morfof: 30 minutes ago or so
 yeah, all the check boxes are checked
 though windows 7 needs a driver installed to connect to the internet
 mordof: how would I do that?
 the installer didn't get far enough to select the partition
 mordof^^
 mordof: it fails as you click next on the screen with the checkboxes (space, internet access)
 mordof: I had him check from the livecd mode, he can get to the internet from the livecd at least
 mordof: is there anywhere else I can ask to get more help?
 ok, I see a couple open bug reports
 http://fossplanet.com/f10/%5Bbug-757720%5D-re-ubi-partman-crashes-exit-code-141-during-liveinstall-143862/
 Can I check the cd for defects in 11.04?
 to see if thats the cause of the error
 I meant the burned cd?
 like the old installers had a "Check cd for defects" option
 I assume its still there, just hidden now?
 dasy2k1: thanks
 Can someone tell me how to disable gpg key validation in synaptic?
 Adding ppa repositories doesn't respect my proxy settings as set through network manager
 And I'm done trying to hack config files to fix it
 usr13: I don't care if my packages are verified, I want it to just work
 usr13: GPG error: The following signatures couldn't be veriefied because the public key is not available ....
 usr13: Therefore, I'm fine turning off all of gpg, I just need to know how to disable it
 Yes, I often add ppas with add-apt-repository
 usr13: because add-apt-repository does not use the proxy settings, it can't handle getting the gpg key
 usr13: therefore any ppa I have will fail to install / update.  Obviously this makes ubuntu unusable.  Therefore I would like to disable gpg verification of my packages
 ActionParsnip: yeah, I'm at work.
 ActionParsnip: not sure that applies, we don't have to authenticate, but I added it so I'll see if it works
 ActionParsnip: actually, my proxy settings are already there from network manager
 usr13: no, I can't ping out as well
 usr13: However, I can get tot the internet through firefox or chrome
 Sylphid, usr13, yeah afaik thats correct, ping should ignore my proxy
 however, apt-add-repository should not, but does
 oh, and as an aside, how am I supposed to get to windows under other windows in unity?
 like if I have this chat windows open with chrome over it, and I get a notification that someone replied
 how do i switch back to chat without minimizing chrome
 yeah, but I have two monitors and its all the way on the left
 and with the new bar I have no way to select which specific windows i'd like to open
 either
 it pretty much sucks right now :(
 Dr_Willis: already looked at that already
 usr13, ActionParsnip: https://bugs.launchpad.net/software-properties/+bug/443404
 usr13, ActionParsnip: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1593268
 both of those detail my issue exactly
 noteventime: no, thats what i wish it did
 ActionParsnip: I can't do that for every ppa all day long.  Thats why I want to just disable gpg
 ActionParsnip: invalid gpg keys letting malicious software be installed isn't a real world problem
 usr13: yeah
 usr13: it was already there, apt-add-repository doesn't respect that setting
 ActionParsnip: its been open since early 9.04 builds
 ActionParsnip: I had the same problem in 10.10
 ActionParsnip: yeah, I'm at work unfortunately.
 usr13: They didn't previously verify the gpg keys
 usr13: you could bypass the invalid keys by default, so it wasn't a problem
 usr13: it no longer responds to the --allow-unauthenticated switch though
 How did they release unity with so many high priority bugs open?
 Every problem I have with it returns a launchpad bug listed as high priority, but still open
 usr13: thats actually already been fixed by default, in 10.10 I believe
 (I've gone through like 5 different bug reports, and tried almost all of the suggestions for config hacks.  Newer reports for more recent versions just don't get replied to)
 usr13: Its only with non standard ppas, because the default ones come with signatures included. Its just ridiculous that this hasn't been fixed yet, and that people are just ignoring ubuntu forum posts about it
 Also, does anyone know if they fixed the ubi-partman installer bug?  My dad couldn't even install on x64 last night.
 ActionParsnip: yep, also ran the test cd for defects from the cd itself
 ActionParsnip: yeah.
 Its great that they want to release every 6 months, but someone should really introduce them to the idea of tested configurations and blockers
 ActionParsnip: so boot into the livecd and try updating packages before running the installer?  i'll have him try that later tonight then
 ActionParsnip: There are open bugs for the exact issue, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/757720
 How is that rated medium?  Its an install failure.  You can't even install ubuntu due to the error. :/
 ActionParsnip: yeah.  Oh, and sorry about raging in general.  If it isn't obvious already, I develop software for a living, and I can't stand to see such poor QA in such a core open source project
 Is there anything new in ubuntu 11.04 that would prevent java rmi from working?
 Something blocking the port perhaps?
 I upgraded from 10.10, and I can no longer connect to weblogic running on my machine
 hmm, actually I can't connect to my machine on any port, but can still ping it
 can someone point me at any basic troubleshooting steps for not being able to connect remotely into ubuntu?
 No, I need to connect to an oracle weblogic application over rmi
 I can't get into the weblogic console either, qin
 qin, I can however ping the computer and get a response back from that
 qin: it worked yesterday, on 10.10
 qin: yes, I'm on it
 qin: I'm actually remoting into the other servers over rdp and vnc, and trying to connect back into it
 I can't seem to connect to application servers hosted on my machine from other machines, however, I can connect from my machine to other machines.  any ideas?  I can ping remotely to my machine though.
 (worked on 10.10, broken when updated to 11.04)
 ActionParsnip: trying to connect over java rmi, or to a weblogic application console (port 7001)
 hamnegga: it worked on 10.10
 Actionparsnip: I can ping the server machine, yes
 ActionParsnip: just a sec, trying to find a vm that has telnet installed
 ActionParsnip: Can't telnet either
 oh, and ActionParsnip, its only remotely, I can connect fine to services on the same pc
 (from that pc)
 ActionParsnip: I installed ssh, and can connect from windows into my ubuntu machine
 anyone else want to give it a go?  Have one ubuntu machine, one windows machine.  Can ssh / ping both ways.  Can't connect to server running on ubuntu machine from windows machine.  Server is fine when connecting from ubuntu to itself.
 misse-: Weblogic
  GeorgeJ: http://pastebin.com/GMRmcQBJ
 weblogic http is at 7001
 and the java rmi server should be available at 9099.
 GeorgeJ: not sure what to do with that...  problem is definitely in ubuntu, all of this worked 2 days ago before upgrading to 11.04
 so where should I look to fix it?
 GeorgeJ: yeah, its running under a jvm.  Is this a new issue for 11.04?
 GeorgeJ: hmm, I'm running the Oracle JVM, and it works on localhost though.  Was 7001 http bound to ipv6 only as well?
 (and wtf, how is this an open bug)
 GeorgeJ: ah ok, people in that bug were commenting it wasn't working in localhost either. And it does seem everything on 7001 is all tcp6 :/
 GeorgeJ: ok, I'll try that.  I can definitely connect, but have no idea what to do from there
 GeorgeJ: ok, running telnet from windows loads an empty command shell
 so it looks like it worked
 but I still can't open ip:7001 in an external browser
 ActionParsnip: yeah, http://myip:7001/console
 let me try restarting my server with the java param to prever ipv4
 GeorgeJ: okay, I can hit my weblogic console, but rmi still isn't running on my ip, only:  tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:9099            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      8362/java
 GeorgeJ: oh, but still no connection :(
 GeorgeJ: http://pastebin.com/F4UR0uyh
 GeorgeJ: http://pastebin.com/LUGSf5ay  ...not sure what happened to the first one
 GeorgeJ: hmm, let me redeploy on both the client and server with a new build and see if that randomly fixes something
 Still not sure why it would work locally and not remotely though.
 I just went to open a text file in Geany, and ubuntu dropped out to the startup x shell, sat on "checking batter state" for 10-15 seconds, and then restarted
 battery^^
 Is there anything I can do to prevent it from restarting and losing all of my stuff?
 in the future?
 battery is fine
 I'm pretty sure it just happened was on that as checking battery state is the last thing that gets printed during boot
 Is ubuntu.com down right now?

 usr13: ubuntu.com filter?
