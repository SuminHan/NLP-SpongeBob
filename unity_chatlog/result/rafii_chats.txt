 MotherMGA: Turn off 'sync to vblank' option from OpenGL section in Compiz config settings manager - no more laggy interface on ATI fglrx drivers
 my today upgrade maverick->natty was fine :D no problem :)
 zookalicious: in my opinion it depend how much someone modificate original system, if more non-stock configuration/modification = greater chance of encounter problem during updating
 zookalicious: yep, older versions was more problematic :) hopefully newer version will be better :D
 who in this channel switch back to good old gnome2 classic panels from unity?
 skulltip: my upgrade 10.10->11.04 was fine :)
 unity not improve workflow, it's only eye-candy...
 axle: may you should do clean install? will be faster than finding a problem with current instalation
 thegoodcushion: have U tried go to rescue mode in safe graphic mode, and on nvidia drivers in gui with restricted drivers?
 i have the similar problem, with fglrx after upgrade 10.10->11.04, system hang on 'checking battery state', and turn on fglrx drivers in gui tool, and work great :) i use PAE kernel
 zyrorl: you tried turn off "sync with Vblank" in compiz-config in OpenGL section?
 zyrorl: and you can turn off "animations", gui will be faster
