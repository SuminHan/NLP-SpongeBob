 yo
 the upgrade (to 11.04) crashed while building the kernel, leaving my boot disk without a usable kernel
 how do I recover from this ?
 (without reinstalling from scratch)
 ok?
 how do I do that?
 ok, I only need one
 ok, I have / (and /boot) as /tmp/a
 ok, done
 ok, thanks
 let met try this
 (first must finish the update/upgrade)
 celthunder : that would avoid me restoring backups ...
 (I do have backups :p)
 celthunder : if I can't restore the kernel, the other option is a clean reinstall
 which I don't want to do
 celthunder : did not work :/
 just chrooting and reconfiguring the kernel
 it failed because it could not mount /proc/
 hmm no
 but the problem is that it did not build the modules (or something)
 let met see, it's rebooting
 nothing for /proc in fstab
 must specify type
 type is wrong or procfs not supported
 celthunder : I booted from live CD. mkdir /tmp/a, mounted dev/sda onto it
 dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-generic
 hmm ok?
 how?
 celthunder : how do I mount / without mounting /proc/ as well?
 when I chroot /tmp/a
 /proc stops working
 celthunder : thx
 let's see
 celthunder : getting somewhere :p
 well, maybe you forgot
 I just didn't know how to do this :p
 ok, so grub seem to have found my previously installed kernel
 I should be able to boot from an older kernel
 celthunder : THANKS A LOT
 happy
 well, lost minor settings, but, meh, whatever :p
 celthunder : I did say thanks a lot, not "thanks a lot, <expletive>" :p
 celthunder : I upgraded a couple of machines, but that was the first one that crashed during the building of the kernel
 but now it works much better
 celthunder : srly, that made my day
 thx again
 ahah
 hmm How do I disable the stupid auto-maximizing of windows whenever I place a window near a screen edge?
 celthunder : still there?
 my nfs mount (still recovering from upgrade to 11.04) shows all file owners as 4294967294 (-2)
 how do I fix this?
