 Is there a specific channel for wireless issues with Ubuntu?
 ok,...I'm using 11.04 with a TP-link TL-WN727n. I've got it connected and can load web pages. However, the connection is very slow.
 Is there a general problem with Ubuntu 11.04 causing intermittent wireless?
 Using 11.04, but my internet speed through wireless is very slow.
