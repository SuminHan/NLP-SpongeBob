 buhman: because it is not yet the 28th in n.america, I guess.
 buhman: sure, on the east coast, but who lives on the east coast?
 buhman: your math is irreproachable.
 buhman: join #ubuntu-release-party
 MasterUbuntu: the internet doesn't work that way.
 cordoval_: reinstall is the easiest way.
 cordoval_: reinstall maverick. you wanted to downgrade, right?
 cordoval_: natty is still supported only in #ubuntu+1
 ls_: get in line.
 ls_: try #ubuntu-release-party for breaking news.
 madhu: how do you mean?
 hcook: I'd like to, but I'm afraid I'd have to google it myself.
 madhu: where should that appear?
 hcook: that should work. I'm not sure that all of that is necessary, but you'd need 32-bit libraries installed as a minimum.
 Guest74426: it's often a good idea to watch for awhile to get a feel for what's going on here.
 vibhav: no
 Guest74426: only if you describe the problem
 vibhav: some time on the 28th
 !party | yuskhanzab
 vibhav: no, I do not have that privilege
 theGreatDane: records the last login time for users :)
 theGreatDane: used by the "last" program, for instance.
 ls_: no
 tensorpudding: I imagine many people here have not yet used natty, so it'd be hard to support.
 tensorpudding: not overnight, no.
 isout1: no
 illmortal: dvdrip is a good front end for ripping dvds specifically, but I haven't seen a good one for general purpose video conversion.
 illmortal: good luck with that
 Glaceon: what's your question?
 Glaceon: yes, I saw that. what is your question?
 hid3: no.
 Glaceon: hard to say. have you tried powering off and restarting?
 Glaceon: does anything appear on screen before it reaches that point?
 cbart: still beta until it's formally released.
 cbart: quite likely, yes. join #ubuntu-release-party for breaking news.
 Glaceon: hmm. without grub showing up, about all you could do is try installing again at this point.
 illmortal: might help to see what was actually installed. dpkg -L packagename will show what was actually installed.
 Bruce_Wayne: natty support is still in #ubuntu+1 at this time
 IanWizard-Mobile: not at this time. join #ubuntu-release-party for breaking news.
 maco: that's unreasonably optimistic :)
 maco: I'm pretty sure it's slipped a few days in some years, but I don't have an example offhand.
 what1: no
 nashj: better yet, join #ubuntu-release-party for breaking news
 Genghiz: breaking news in #ubuntu-release-party
 illmortal: that's a fairly technical question, and should probably be directed at a forum surrounding the converting application you're using.
 illmortal: I had thought that 1500 was typical for xvid encoding of movies, at least.
 my thoughts exactly
 histo: already gone.
 histo: I did the same thing, except that I read what I typed first :)
 histo: you are the keyboard ninja :)
 Nabbies: breaking news in #ubuntu-release-party
 Glaceon: bad news. do you have more than one hard drive?
 Glaceon: because I've seen that happen when the bios and linux have different ideas about the hard drive order, and grub ends up installed on the wrong disk.
 maco: could you add the release party channel in your copypasta? It would come off as more friendly.
 jslozier: try /exit
 or /quit
 proq: i haven't seen that before. is that a limit from wubi itself, for some reason?
 I guess that was 119GB free
 anthony_2409: no. breaking news in #ubuntu-release-party
 at least!
 histo: a little fom column A, a little from column B
 kaatta: almost none at all.
 smw: I think there's an "apt-torrent" package that does that.
 koshie: it's possible, but unlikely. the torrent file itself contains hashes used to verify the contents.
 Kevin147: now stable
 pumeust: because processes don't often have a lot to do.
 pumeust: like what?
 pumeust: huh. well, most processes spend most of their time sleeping. I think you may have just misinterpreted what windows presented.
 pumeust: because it spends most of its time waiting for your input, or waiting for traffic from the network.
 pumeust: I think you may be misinterpreting what windows is showing you.
 pumeust: take another look at it when you get a chance, it may make more sense now.
 lucas: replace the battery :)
 lucas: you can also remove the battery. I'm not sure offhand how to disable just that message, though.
 lucas: google search turns this up: "I was able to fix this by opening gconf-editor, and setting the key /apps/gnome-power-manager/notify/low_capacity to false."
 giulia: what is the problem you're having? I think it's scrolled past already.
 giulia: could you put the problem on one line, so the first half doesn't scroll off before you're done?
 damiano: there's a lighttpd channel here on freenode that might be better suited for your question.
 giulia: using natty, or a different version?
 giulia: okay, I don't know then. They seem to be using a different clock applet now.
 giulia: I have nothing to add, I have not used natty.
 alecbenzer: do apt-get update again
 Guest78840: could you describe the problem? It's long since scrolled off.
 cablop: it's an incremental change as always.
 Theoretician: yes
 jw_: #ubuntu-offtopic
 numbah1hax0r: lucid lynx
 numbah1hax0r: yes
 KatronixSerf: I think "swapon -s" shows what's being used for swap.
 fi103910: it may be that your processor doesn't support the PAE extension.
 fi103910: err.. fix what?
 codingenesis: what do you want to develop?
 fi103910: I don't understand what you want to accomplish.
 fi103910: if a PAE kernel doesn't work on your system, don't use a PAE kernel :)
 fi103910: should be enough to remove the pae kernel, then the non-pae one that you have will be the default.
 sdwrage: sorry, they've already scrolled off the screen.
 fi103910: sec, I think ubottu has an entry for removing extra kernels.
 fi103910: I can't find it. It should be like removing any other package, remove it with apt-get remove or synaptic
 fi103910: the package name will start with linux-image. Make sure you don't remove the kernel that's actually running, though the package tools should warn you about that.
 tfrojd: nope, that sounds right.
 Isonyx: use kill -9 instead
 Isonyx: or, the process is running as a different user than your kill script.
 tfrojd: you're doing it the right way. I don't know why it doesn't work.
 McQueen: I don't know, but you are truly a master of the ellipsis.
 hyperbole is endearing
 miceiken: could be bad disk?
 miceiken: yes
 then bad image, maybe.
 miceiken: when you start up the cd, there's a "media test" option, right? run that, see what it says.
 sahil: try running apt-get update again
 TheRedOctober: you are, I guess.
 sahil: I don't understand what you mean.
 sahil: i'm out of ideas.
 miceiken: i see. that rules out that theory then.
