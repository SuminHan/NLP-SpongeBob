 now that i did chroot .. how can I check why the box wasn't booting .. someone apparently installed upstart and removed it .. broke things
 someone installed upstart and removed it .. the system hangs at booting .. is there a way to revert things to before upstart was installed?
 sorry?
 terry, yes
 terry, how can i test if the booting sequence is ok?
 terry, i managed to boot: "The rescue mode installs a temporary Slackware distro on a separate partition, gives it your IP,and then mounts your main disk to make it available:"
 terry, is there a boot log somewhere in ubuntu?
 just wana see where it hangs
 i chrooted into the install
 terry, upstart wasnt there .. and the system was booting until it was installed
 until it was installed/uninstalled
