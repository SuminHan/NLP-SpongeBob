 yeah, that whas an other freeze
 pleased if someone could help me. I know how to work with kernel, ppa, etc.
 Installed latest xorg, intel gpu
 drivers
 sorry, will not do that again :P hmmm @ikonia, can you show me that?
 I've now installed the package linux-crashdump.. Just wait till an other freeze comes?
 can nobody help me here?
 @ikonia: thanks for the reply. I didnt understand that correctly, so what must I do?
 I've find this here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/3051/how-can-i-get-a-kernel-core-dump, but this only seems to work, when there is a freeze, right?
 I've also checked that it actualy no freeze, I can still press CTRL+ALT+F1/F3
 @mnassif: when you press the caps/num lock keys, do they go on? Also can you press CTRL+ALT+F2?
