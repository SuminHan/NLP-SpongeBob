 Hi. After upgrading from 10.10 to 11.04 i can't log in. My machine freezes at the ubuntu splash-screen. What log files should I read to find out what's going on? I can log in in failsaxe graphics mode.
 is the nvidia-driver removed when upgrading to 11.04? how can i get it back?
 after upgrading to 11.04 my mouse is not uncluttered anymore, but it kinda flutters on and of. this raises windows accidentally sometimes.
 Anyone know why blackjack is no longer part of the gnome-games package?
 Did I get another nvidia driver when i upgraded to 11.04? Google earth suddenly won't work, I get : Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
 Google Earth has caught signal 11.
