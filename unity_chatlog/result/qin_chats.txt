 x3464: Launchpad seems to be on lockdown
 econnell: Ah...
 nsmnmj: Are you installing via dpkg or apt ?
 nsmnmj: What package?
 nsmnmj: Did you downmoad gtk?
 nsmnmj: Gtk.org do not load, but it is not easy (or sane) to override version.
 sobersabre: That means you cannot use 771
 sobersabre: ok, either: setupcon, or use this (very good) how to: http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/ (it is about old problem, but usable).
 mattyh88: try: setupcon
 vanguard: compiz --replace ??
 kate__: Did you burn in to CD, and how?
 vanguard: No clue... I am afraid my Natty updrade is nto done yet.
 isibilir: Stop hwat?
 *what?
 Kevin147: df -h  or  dfisk -l
 isibilir: sudo service gdm stop
 isibilir: it will drop you to terminal
 DasEi: He wanted to stop gnome, Should scroll more?
 Ahmuck: Use rather google, than this channel (atm).
 Ahmuck: Coz, Unity removal method is uncertain 1 day after release (give it a time).
 Ahmuck: Once more, you have Option to choose Classic Gnome Session.
 Ahmuck: You mean in live session, no
 Ahmuck: Saved
 Furry: .jar is run by java
 sudipta: Did you test it in live session, if yes what sessin did you get (Unity or Classic)?
 Ahmuck: agree
 sudipta: ok, you would want to remove (propably faulty) driver, try: jockey-text in terminal
 sudipta: try update and install driver again (via Menu > System > Admin > Hardware)
 sweb: Are you asking about "some gnome themes are broken"?
 sudipta: To start driver you need to reboot
 sudipta: Well, better remove it then, also check your card for support (for maverick drivers you will get certain answer).
 rpk: you mean ssh?
 sweb: Hectic start ;)
 sudipta: Yes, lack of acceleration, update and check your card
 sudipta: Card often droping from support, but you can try also mesa drivers
 rpk: Do you have access (phisical) to server?
 rpk: You want to start with basic sevice (ssh | nc) and monitor connection on server, on Natty ckeck lan and resolve.
 sweb: You need to know that Unity do not have that rich configuration as Gnome, yet.
 sweb: Do not remove Unity, just, at login Chose Classic Gnome (bottom bar, after to choose user, before password)
 ^choose
 sweb: Gnome in Natty is stable (I thinks same version what Maveric)
 sweb: Did you get themes, are they installed?
 TiagoTiago: No
 isibilir: Mostly we use jockey to obtain driver, jockey-txt with no gui, but nvidia drivers from web should have install notes or script.
 sweb: Puzzled, hm, if you say that gnome do not let you do something, update would be first reaction.
 isibilir: Find what?
 isibilir: In console, type: jockey-text, need connection to Internet, if no driver is detected, try to search for mesa support for your card.
 kate__: It would be easier to try Usb approach.
 silverpt: You mean no display or dimmed?
 ubuntu_: Make sure your HD is mounted
 raylee_: Yes, less than BSD
 qw: sudo apt-get remove <package name>
 dr0id: w
 dr0id: w to see users (who), iftop to have live connections listed
 tyreza: lshw (why do you need serial?)
 tyreza: Em? list of ip to ssh with exec with lshw with some knowledge of bash (why do you need serial?)
 tyreza: you can skip one coz it would be ilogical, so you needto ssh only to two (or one if you use one locally)
