 In unity is there any way to separate a maximized window's titlebar from the main panel?
 Could I at least change the titlebar text color then? With the New Wave theme it is Black on dark gray for the main panel.
 Hello. I'm having some trouble with Thunderbird and Unity. I can't access the main menu for the application. Any know what's going on?
