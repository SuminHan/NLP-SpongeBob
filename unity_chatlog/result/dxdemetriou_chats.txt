 upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 I have the error "The upgrade has completed but there were errors during the upgrade process"
 if upgrade does not complete can I re-run the cleaning process?
 if the upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 is completed can I repair it? After pressing OK it didn't make the cleanup process.

 RoDiMuS-X, it does not have any broken packages, just completed with errors without cleaning non-required packages, and the problem is that I can't find what package/s produced the problem.
 where is the configuration for X now (xorg.conf)? Nvidia still uses xorg.conf.

 zvacet, I see a lot of warnings/errors in each new release and I have to choose if it's better the troubleshooting or rebuilding.
 zvacet, the latest is that I have the unity with background only.
