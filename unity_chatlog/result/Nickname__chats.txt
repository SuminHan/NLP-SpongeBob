 <jaymeskeller> Hi, I have been looking for an answer to the g15 crash. It seems that uinput is missing from /dev. Any ways to fix it? using it now in natty but had to edit /dev
 using pae & nvidia aok
 alt+F?
 black screen =nvidia driver?
 main source of black screen is usually weirk nvidia/kernel issue, do text install, update then retry
 using natty with classic (normal gnome) no hassels unity not worth the hassel
 and usung radiotray
 classic = no headaches :)
 no
 switch desktops but keep checking updates
 nice website for noobies & pros webupd8
 lopyshok run alsamixer and check cards (sometimes uses wrong one)
 WPA  can be issue with some wireless,  test without security then wep   if ok the software issue
