 KNUBBIG,  sebsebseb , any ideas please ??
 hmmm, let me check if this is the case
 sebsebseb, fdisk -l shows that the sda6 is the linux partition and pressing e on the boot menu item shows like this, set root='(hd0,msdos6)' is that ok ?
 i would have done a clean install already but i have many programs installed and dont have to do all the reinstallation, i have to finish projec work.
 and the worst is that my wife also uses the same pc with a mulitseat and now she also cant work :(
 can i somehow specify the device resolution at kerrnel boot line ? when i press the e key?
