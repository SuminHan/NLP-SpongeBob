 ok one quick question... how do I switch the video driver from the nouveau driver to the proprietary NVidia driver (its installed and activated but the Additional drivers app says its not currently in use)?
 thanks ActionParsnip will try that
 ok, so that will switch it right? Just reboot not ActionParsnip
 now*
 ok, thanks bud... appreciate the help :)
 ok still says its activated but not in use... sheesh
 anyone know why despite my running sudo nvidia-xconfig it still says the driver is activated but not currently in use? Am i missing something here?
 ok, maybe I'll uninstall and reinstall the driver... maybe that will help...
 Ok, have tried everything I know here... the NVidia driver still come up activated but not currently in use under the additional drivers app
 ok, nvm then... sheesh
