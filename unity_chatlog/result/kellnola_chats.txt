 any pitivi users in here?
 Herbs, huh? LOL!
 Herbs, missed your question
 Herbs, oh my yes. It can be frustrating.
 the whole init / upstart thing would be painful to an RHEL type
 Herbs, LTS is for production. The regular distro is actually pretty bleeding edge
 Herbs, what's the prob. exactly?
 Herbs, yes but that is RPM ... ANATHEMA!
 Herbs you can install chkconfig but it doesn't work with everything
 Herbs, you can use update-rc.d
 udo update-rc.d -f daemon remove <- like chkconfig daemon off
 Herbs, yes but not all .04 are LTS
 64bit hasn't had those problems in a long time
 eltigre, yes flash player works fine
 [deXter], run "file" against any binary on it
 [deXter], try what I said
 [deXter], mount the iso, and run "file" against any binary WITHIN it
 exalt, startup disk tool
 velcroshooz, yes, flash is kinda shitty, but it does work
 exalt, "System Tools -> Startup Disk Creator"
 no probs with 64 bit on desktop here. Would not be able to use my 16GB of memory without it
 I run a lot of VMs
 jaredquinn, of course it is
 jatt, LOL. yes
 jaredquinn, it's a computer.
 crashanddie, the new debian is pretty awesome
 crashanddie, oh well, back to windowmaker
 unity looks like it is meant for a touchscreen to me
 rgr, 'cause unity requires 3D
 zetheroo, yeah, if all you use the computer for is web browsing and irc ... I am frankly horrified about video editing. 10.10 is bad enough
 falxx, I would remove any ppa's before upgrading. and remove the software first
 bencc, yes but it isn't very useful
 bencc, well, if everyone did that ...
 TORRENTS people
 jatt, yeah like 4 years ago
 Psydoll, gimp is the best by far
 Psydoll, but it does not have all the features of photoshop 4 or 5
 is gimp stil under active development? it doesn't seem to have moved forward in a while
 Incarus6, \o/
 trans, ? ctrl-alt F1
 really, 32 bit is for 1GB or less, anything more gives a performance hit vs. 64 bit. I can't imagine anyone having 1GB on a desktop these days. I am broke and have the mem.
 velcroshooz, yeah. One of the things RHEL actually did right was make all 32 bit libs and apps available by just appending ".i386" to the package name
 Jarod51, switch the cables? :/
 Jarod51, you can do it in Xorg.conf
 wait, does unity use compiz or does it have it's own thing?
 DarkStar1, IIRC, isn't it in /etc/slapd/ ?
 DarkStar1, dpkg -L slapd
 nameless`, no
 grammatically, yes I suppose
 nameless`, well if it's creative writing ok
 topramen, I have an answer
 topramen, "I don't know" :)
 what is ubuntu going to do after zany zebra?
 topramen, no ... I assume it still has synaptic or ubuntu software center
 Jordan_U, well in this case it may be better to just blow it away with the cd.
 Jordan_U, I dist-upgraded since feisty all the way to lucid and I missed all kinds of new crap
 Jordan_U, and then with 10.10 I'm like, what is all this upstart crap?
 fruitwerks-web, nfs3 or 4?
 I never had probs with nfs3 against solaris or RHEL
 ohsix, why would anyone use samba in a unix environment if windows is not involved?
 so has the unity hate died down since thursday?
 it shocks me the number of users that think they "have" to use GNOME with ubuntu
 yerac, you can kill from top
 it's a proxy.
 bromium, what is the problem? been a while since I used it, but it's pretty basic ...
 bromium, hmm. privoxy is not the heavyweight program squid is ... it might be faster for a little lan
 bromium, but squid is simple enough to configure with dansguardian
 bromium, my brief experience with privoxy about ten years ago was that it is flaky
 bromium, yes, well when you're doing things like this it's best to disable the firewall temporarily until you get everything working
 bromium, you mentioned iptables
 Fahmida, /tmp I believe
 Fahmida, make sure you do "ls -a" or enable viewing hidden files in nautilus
 vbox supports 3D. Don't know how well
 this whole "requiring 3D" was an enormous mistake
 skiwithpete, it's on the MBR
 skiwithpete, any other OS will overwrite that
 skiwithpete, "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=446 count=1" will delete the MBR (from linux, where "hda" is the drive you want to erase it on - make sure you get the right device)
 skiwithpete, no it will delete the MBR completely
 zepherin, then you don't have it installed somehow
 F1
 html_inprogress, it almost always can, but I haven't thrown anything too complicated at it.
