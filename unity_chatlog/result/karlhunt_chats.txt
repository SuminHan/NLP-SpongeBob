 You can still start in gnome by choosing ubuntu classic at login
 Im running sandy bridge which works ok but graphics is poor. 2d support only
 lots of tearing etc
 default
 Incarus6, I just keep up to date with the ubuntu kernel
 is there a more upstream one?
 zetheroo, unity worked on my old gma intel chipset but sandy bridge has a new one.
 Incarus6, yup
 Incarus6, been running beta for a few weeks and did a dist-upgrade last night
 Incarus6, 2.6.38-8-generic
 I think my chip is an intel hd3000 whatever that is
 zetheroo, did you buy it in the last 2 months and is it core i5/i7 if not then unlikely
 zetheroo, your graphics will be fine
 When my screen dims it lags coming back out. Im going to try an upstream kernel
