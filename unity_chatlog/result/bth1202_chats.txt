 hello
 I tried to install Ubuntu with ubuntu CD on a latest computer system
 However, It shows some error message, DVI-D recognition error, and then stopped installing.
 my graphic card is "ATI Radeon 5750" series. How can I solve this problem?
 By the way, I've been trying to upgrade my ubuntu box from 10.10 to 11.04.
 It still have problem during the job. What's the matter there?
 The error message was " package downloading time is expired" .
 Is there any specific trouble in there, ubuntu mirrors?
 Hello? is there anyone who can support me with the install problem on the newest computer?
 DVI-D recognition trouble during the first step of installing.
