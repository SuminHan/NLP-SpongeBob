 I thought i won't hear XP in this room :-)
 LOL
 if u really need to run photoshop, use MAC!!! :-)
 any way, serious question....any admins over here? i really need help
 ok...i will define my question, maybe it will be better :-)
 just installed my brand new 10.04 server (full install by myself from scratch for the first time)...and every thing went pretty good
 i am doing it because i need to let other develop with me on a django project...
 do i installed everything
 now..i am working on a MAC and trying to open the project on the server from eclipse from my mac
 and i am getting permistion denied all the time....
 but i did mount the directory on the server
 so i don't understand how can i mount the directory but not able to do other stuff?
 No one about my problem :-(
