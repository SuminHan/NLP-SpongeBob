 Depends on what you wanna do.
 @xgates The biggest problem was browsers when 64-bit first came out.
 Plugins werent compatible with the 64-bit versions
 but that's barely an issue now
 yup
 It's got a slight performance advantage
 64-bit flash was working pretty well last time I tried it. You can run the 32-bit version with a compatibility layer.
 If anything acts up
 maybe you dont have enough video ram for that resolution.
 @kneaux Only if you changed hardware. If you just upgraded, that would be bizarre
 @kneaux, I would make sure the graphics driver being used is the right one...
 !!!
 @kneaux I had that happen
 @kneaux check the connection to your monitors. Maybe do a power-cycle on them
 @kneaux and reconnect them. They might be detected incorrectly
 @kneaux damn. =/
 @escott, yeah that's probably the case
 @kneaux try 'lsmod | grep flgrx' in the console
 Ohh that.
 @Greensky there's an 'update' option on the CD.
 It didnt always work for me, though. On my laptop, it was unavailable.
 @virunga No. :/
 @Sonjaaa I think that's an option in the BIOS on most computers...
 Sonjaaa, If i understand correctly, I think you need to disable your motherboard's graphic adapter.
 I have a question about Libreoffice actually.
 What's the major difference between it and OpenOffice? And is it more compatible with .pttx and .docx?
 @omega Sweet. I had Openoffice screw up a powerpoint for school. :/
 @omega I had enough paranoia to boot Win7 and check it on Office 2010
 @omega I still had to re-do most of the slides, though. :/
 So I was looking in ccsm... Unity basically doesn't work without compiz?
 nerox, click the power button on the top right, go to system settings.
 Keyboard shortcuts.
 @nerox: scroll down and look for Alt+F2 under the shortcut column
 oh
 @ner0x its 'show the panel's "Run Application Dialogue vox
 @nerox under the desktop category
 @ner0x might want to intall ccsm and change the compiz settings, then
 sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
 ^was @ner0x
 @ner0x it would be under the Ubuntu Unity Plugin i think
 Nawk: compiz
 There's a 'unity plugin' for compiz installed.
 I went into ccsm and screwed with compiz's settings. How do I get it so that Unity isnt crazy?
