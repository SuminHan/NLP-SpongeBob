 Hello, If i want last to display all logins for a particular user, which file should the -f switch point to
 ?
 If i do "last (username)" it only displays logins from the beggining of the day (it says wtmp starts then) how do i get it to go further back?
 im pretty sure i got hacked over the weekend as i saw the same ip in my ssh log as in the xsender ip in some hotmail emails i didnt send
 i want to find out what they did =/
 gorby
 ultrax: gorby
 yeah ive done that, it looks fine
 ultrax: but it cant be coinsidence that i see that ip in my ssh log, and in the bad emails in hotmail
 ultrax: can i use last some how to display all logins within a particular date range?
