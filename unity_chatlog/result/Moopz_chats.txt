 So, I've been searching but can't find an answer. Is it possible to upgrade from 10.04 to 11.04 directly without upgrading to 10.10? And would upgrading affect anything on my computer, i.e. break something?
 Pici, oh? I thought all xx.04 versions were LTS?
 Pici, any idea when the next LTS version is coming then?
