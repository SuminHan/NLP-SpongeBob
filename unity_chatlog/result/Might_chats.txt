 So yeah, ubuntu 11.04 destroyed my install
 the update
 No wonder average users don't like linux, because you run the auto updator and suddenly you can't boot anymore.
 I need some major help
 I have a prompt now when I boot, it says "grub rescue>"
 I looked up the commands
 only 2 seem to even exist
 set and ls
 I want grub gone
 I want ubuntu gone
 I'm done with this crap
 I do, I can't boot into it
 becuase of grub
 I don't want it fixed, I want grub removed and to be able to boot into my win7 partition
 none of the commands listed for the rescue mode even work
 The bootloader is there, it's the MBR
 I can fix it once I'm in windows
 but I can't get into wndows, because grub says the "boot" command doesn't exist
 my upgrade to 11.04 was a complete failure
 my nvidia drivers didn't exist anymore, and I'm an average linux user, I don't know how to install a driver from commandline
 so I ended up completely purging the linux partition on my drive using fire.
 I think this whole aversion by ubuntu to using the nvidia proprietary drivers is a big overzealous
 bit*
 how does one install an nvidia driver from commandline
 one who has barely -any- linux experience, is that really what people are forced to do when upgrading distros?
 I can't remember a -single- major version upgrade that hasn't fallen on it's face completely and left my computer unusable. forcing me to reinstall using a new ISO of the new version
 SCREW Ubuntu major revision upgrading, it -ALWAYS- breaks my system, I'm now so frustrated I am discontinuing use of linux based distributions entirely, GOOD DAY
