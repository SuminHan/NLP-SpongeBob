 Hello. I have upgraded to 11.04 and wanted to see if the nvidia-drivers are installed. Turns out they are "active" but not "in use". How can I actually use them?
 Incarus6: erm... what is jokey?
 Incarus6: ah, okay, but that is what I had already opened (looking for "driver"). The problem is: There is no activate button anywhere.
 Incarus6: yes, and at the bottom of the window is this: "This driver is activated but not currently in use." Does that mean I need to do a restart to activate it?
 Incarus6: I have found something on the net. Will try a restart.
 Incarus6: Still no success. Do you have any ideas on how I can use the nvidia-drivers?
 Incarus6: one moment, trying something. Maybe I need to do another restart. If so, I will paste the output from glxinfo afterwards.
 Incarus6: This is the output from glxinfo: http://pastebin.com/Hs8x8WB8
 Incarus6: If I look at that glxinfo-output it looks to me as if the nvidia-drivers are installed. What do you think?
 Incarus6: Nope, it seems that Unity is working. At least I got that dock-like thing on the left and I can search for items. My sole problem is that the hardware-drivers-app tells me that the nvidia-drivers aren't used. Though I am able to start a game that uses a 3D-environment, if that is anything to judge from. Basically all I want is to make sure that the nvidia-drivers are installed.
 Incarus6: I only have this one game (Planeshift) which was only usable on 10.10 with nvidia-drivers installed. And yes, as far as I can tell, all works. I was just confused about the message shown by the hardware-driver-app, telling me that the drivers aren't used. But from the impression I got (the game works flawless) it seems they *are* installed. Just confusing.
 jdobrien: I have exactly the same problem, though everything looks as if they *are* in use, despite the message.
 kezzawd: Add me to the users with that problem :)
 jdobrien: That doesn't really make sense. I guess the nvidia-drivers should be less graphics-card-intensive than the open-source drivers. At least that was the impressiion I had when I tried them. So I guess the fan should be running *less*, not *more* with the nvidia-drivers installed and used.
 btw, I have another problem. It seems I can't find any apps when typing them in the search-box that pops up when one clicks on the Ubuntu-symbol.
 I mean, Ubuntu doesn't show them, like when I type "terminal" for example or "Firefox". It's only showing documents, as it seems.
 oh wait, I solved it.
 jdobrien: No. But I noticed that I had clicked one of the buttons in the search-box without realizing it, making it look for documents only. It's very hard to notice that, as there is almost no difference between the selected and unselected button.
 jdobrien: yeah, it definitely needs some refinement there.
 Hello. I have switched to Ubuntu Classic in 11.04. Is there a way to activate the global menu there as well (like in Unity)?
 Hi. Is there a way to get rid of this stupidly stin "scrollbars" that aren't really scrollbars anymore in 11.04?
 *stupidly thin I mean
 botcity: You don't happen to know what option that is, do you?
 hello. I have heard to Gnome 3 will break Unity and/or Compiz. But will it also break the "Ubuntu Classic"-GUI (where I use compiz).
 Hi. When I open a Gnome-Terminal, the scrollbar on the right works as usual (plus the scrollwheel. But if I open a GNU-screen-session, the scrollbar (the button within it) is always as high as the window and I can't scroll with the mouosewheel anymore. Can this be fixed?
 Can somebody tell me how I can use indicators in 11.04 (adding them to the menubar)? I don't seem to find anything about it.
 jatt, kezzawd: the problem is not "installing" but actually "using" them. I have installed a sysmonitor-indicator but I don't know how I can make it show up.
 jatt: Aren't they called indicators in 11.04?
 jatt: And yes, that is what I mean.
 kezzawd: okay, I will try that, thanks.
 Arney: That was my question :)
 kezzawd: Thank you! That worked. Not too intuitive method though, but oh well.
 Arney: I didn't have any problems with the clock. What are you talking about?
