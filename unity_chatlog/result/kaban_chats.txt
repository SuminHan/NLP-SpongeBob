 hello
 I upgrade my ubuntu do 11.04 serverx does not start... here is my log: http://wklej.org/id/521203/ how can I solve this problem?
 thanks incarus6, i will try :)
 hello again, I reinstalled fglrx but the same problem...
 Incarus6: i uninstalled fglrx, moved folders /usr/lib/fglrx and /usr/lib32/fglrx to have clear install and installed it again - no resutls
 Incarus6: it worked in 10.10 very well, compiz and so on works fine
 incarus6: I will try with pure install, many thanks :)
 Incarus6: I will try livecd first, of course, we will see what happen
