 I wondering about the stability of wubi with Windows 7-64? The last time I tried it was with Windows 7-32 and it did not go well
 I ended up with extra loader entries in the Windows boot loader
 okay so it means either run virtual machine or dual-boot and given that speech recognition doesn't work in Linux, it's virtual machine. :-)
 any reason to use 64 over 32 bit?
 okay. I give it a go
 the last time I ran 64 was on an AMD machine I had for my wife and stability was not great. That was about 12 to 18 months ago
 on the other hand, all she runs his flash because all she does is Facebook and Thunderbird
 okay well I can always back down to 32 bit if I need to
 which is probably the way to go.. Thanks for the feedback.
