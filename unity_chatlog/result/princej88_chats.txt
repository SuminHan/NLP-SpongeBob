 Hi,  I just isntalled natty on a dual monitor desktop, I was able to have multiple desktops before i installed the hardware drivers, now the monitors option just says unknown and cant detect monitors. Now both screens are mirrored and at low resolution. Any idea how to fix this. I even tried configuring the monitors through amd catalyst control center but no luck. Any ideas? thanks
