 how do you set the terminal bell? I'm using zsh and urxvt, and I can't remember how to set this variable. echo -e -n "\a" produces no output
 isn't vlc the only free media player with hardware accel

 its very particular to your hardware/software environment
 PythonPup: I wouldn't be the one to know, since I asked if vlc was the only one.
 thegoodcushion: 10.04 has gnome.

 Jordan_U: ....that's fricken evil
 Jordan_U: other than getting the source and applying that patch is there any other way to change this? i.e. ppa?
 Jordan_U: or actually, is there a way to get the bell to load a system sound to ubuntu?
 carandraug: you might try #git, since git has plugins for all those repository types.
 pooltable: /join #linuxmint-help
 carandraug: um, an IDE might do it, possibly eclipse or emacs...actually almost certainly emacs.
 if you like that OS.
 carandraug: probably not, gedit has a fairly limited plugin selection. Especially compared to Eclipse/Vim/Emacs

 Cairo|Mac: sudo apt-get install pastebinit
 pastebinit should really be installed by default
 and all you do is pastebinit file and it gives you a link

 also instead of lynx try: elinks, links2 or w3m
