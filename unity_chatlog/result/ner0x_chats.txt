 david8732: Thank you.
 david8732: It is not there. At least I don't see it.
 david8732: I have it already set for "Switch to Desktop 2"

 david8732: ccsm?
 What setting would I find it under?
 Is there a way to go back from using unity? and stick with gnome?
 Also, any way to go back to firefox 3.6? Selenium isn't compatible with 4.*
 It's almost worth going to 10.04 LTS after this update. :-/
 Is there a way to go back to X and Gnome in 11.04 ?
 aeon-ltd: The default Unity and whatever server they use.
 aeon-ltd: Already did that, still is pretty buggy.
 I still think the manager should say "gnome" "unity" "kde" etc.
 aptitude FTW
 Anyone to keep track of expenses in Ubuntu?
 bazhang: Yeah.
 bazhang: Yeah, something like that.
