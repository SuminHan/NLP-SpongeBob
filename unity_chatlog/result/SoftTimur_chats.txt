 Hello all, I just upgraded my ubuntu to 11.04. It is odd that after pressing Alt+F2, I could not launch "about:config", could anyone help?
 ActionParsnip: I do not see what you mean
 ActionParsnip: I do not know how to use about:config in a Firefox command
 ActionParsnip: I see what you mean, but I want to do this http://www.multimediaboom.com/how-to-make-the-panel-transparent-in-ubuntu-11-04-natty-narwhal/

 ActionParsnip: it does not do anything
 usr13: it does not show anything
 ActionParsnip: yes I have that, but it is different from what the link shows
 ActionParsnip: well, I see your point
 ActionParsnip: but isn't it odd that I could not launch about:config by Alt+F2 as the link shows?
