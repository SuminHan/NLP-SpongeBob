 JunK-Y: System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Visual Effects?  I'm on 10.10, but I don't think the place has changed.
 silvrax: no
 silvrax: No idea really... are you using compiz? It has lots of crazy options and that... might be one of them. I don't really know.
 silvrax: Apparently there's something called "unclutter" which does that
 silvrax: might want to check if it's installed
 silvrax: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unclutter
 hmm
 I can't seem to upgrade to 11.04 from 10.10 because of "broken or held packages". What should I do to get more information about what's going wrong?
 I don't appear to have any held packages at the moment
 ohsix: is there an easy way to get a list of the packages it thinks are pinned?
 ohsix: I don't have any held packages at the moment
 and everything is upgraded to the latest version in 10.10
 ohsix: I normally just use apt-get
 Pulseaudio is completely broken on my machine (only shows single master greyed out volume control pegged at zero). Is there a convenient PPA or something for adding back the gnome volume control panel applet in 11.04?
 (the one which works with alsa)
 bullgard4: I've already selected "Ubuntu Classic" and gotten the standard panel. The problem is that the only provided volume control is the pulseaudio one built into the indicator applet
 bullgard4: For the last few versions of ubuntu, I've been forced to recompile the gnome-media package without the pulseaudio stuff in it.
 bullgard4: But that's being a bit temperamental now, and I'm wondering if there isn't a better way to go about removing pulseaudio and setting things up nicely wrt. panel applets for volume control and mixers etc.
 (I'm thinking that surely removing pulseaudio must be common enough a request that other people have encoded their solutions in the form of a package or something :)
 bullgard4: If you right click a blank space on your panel and choose "Add to Panel...", do you see Volume Control among the listed applets?
 Or do you only have the indicator applet?
 Pascalcmoi: I had to install linux-headers-2.6.38-8-generic-pae
 Pascalcmoi: I don't know how I managed to get to a terminal, I basically mashed F1, Esc, Delete a bunch while it was starting up, and then hit control-alt-F1 :P
 Pascalcmoi: and then installed the linux-headers-2.6.38-8-generic-pae package, and that fixed it
 Pascalcmoi: Do you have an nvidia card?
 Pascalcmoi: yeah, I think you're seeing the same problem I was -- does it just get stuck on the stupid splash screen with 5 red dots?
 bullgard4: Because pulseaudio is basically completely broken on my hardware for whatever reason. It gives me only a single master volume control (no separate controls for the dozen or so things my hardware supports), and pegs my headphone volume to 0. In the latest Ubuntu, the master volume control is even greyed out.
 bullgard4: I'm fairly convinced that will require my contributing code to the PA project, which seems excessive in comparison with just disabling it and using the features that ALSA already provides, which I know are sufficient for me :)
 bullgard4: I was really asking if there's a PPA of packages suited for people not wanting to run pulseaudio
 Or any external package repo, really.
