 Hello, using Unity 11.04, how do I make the launcher execute multiple instances of a program (such as gnome-terminal)?
 ActionParsnip: I don't want tabs, I want seperate windows
 hmm, nevermind, I guess that seems to do what I want. Thanks ActionParsnip bastidrazor
 hello, using 11.04 Unity, is there anything that parallels an application dock? I feel like there is no visible notifications for things like pidgin and thunderbird

 hello, using 11.04 Unity, is there anything that parallels an application dock? I feel like there is no visible notifications for things like pidgin and thunderbird
 ActionParsnip: is that something else to install, or just the left side? that doesn't do well for status notification
 also I miss having a running performance monitor in the dock, all you get are static icons from dasher
 Is there any way to add things to the top bar? next to volume and such?
 thanks coz_
