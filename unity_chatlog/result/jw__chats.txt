 are there a lot of 11.04 upgrade issues today?
 I upgraded, after the reboot it says the disk drive for /home is not ready yet... has someone seen this yet? Quick fix?

 thank you Dennda!
 I did see something about editing fstab but can't tell if that's the be all end all fix for this issue
 gah.. 4 hours to download 700mb :(
 xchat seems cool!
 I have a quick but irgent question I'm doing a fresh install and got an error while installing GRUB its asking for where to install it? I have 4 options one of them being my windows 7 partition, any ideas???
 11.04
 DR_Willis: I have a RAID and I'm just not sure which partition to install it to? Linux device mapper, Windows 7 or RAIDp6 or RAIDp7
 When installing 11.04 on a RAID, where should boot loader be installed?? Dev mapper win7 partition or dev/SDA ?

 anyone know?
 I ask only because it failed to install it to sda then asked where I would like to install it.
 RAID 0 2 drives
 I partitioned off space for Ubuntu the rest is Win7
 Finally got on to 11.04 looks beautiful, Does compiz work at all?
 bin laden is dead. :)
 wish there was more options to customize unity, any plans to release an update?
 Also how do you get the additional plugins to work, ie Burn and Explode?
 yes
 drag: yes Aauthor yes
 I had to download the additional effects plug in, I see the options, but they're not working. When I enable them the file menu bar disappears
 Any idea if ubuntu will soon release patches to fix unity/other misc bugs?
 no customization is really disappointing, that's why I moved to linux. If I wanted to be forced into a style I'll just stick with windows or mac
 yeah I looked at classic, but am concerned that they will force unity in 11.10
 I guess Im just real happy with 10.10 - I liked having all the eye candy which doesnt seem to work well in 11.
