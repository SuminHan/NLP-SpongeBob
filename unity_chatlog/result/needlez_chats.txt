 hey, got a quick question, what is the deal with trying to install dofus on ubuntu 11.04?? dofus is a program that uses adobe air to install, it wont install at all for me.
 also, has anyone had any glitches or issues with the screensaver?? rss-glx and nvidia graphics cards?
 syn3rgy: sorry, its a nvidia 310M, and using the screensavers don't crash just I noticed a strange line that seperates the screen half like
 Juest: KK, ill try that im gonna uninstall it right now then try that
 syn3rgy: no drivers where provided when i installed ubuntu 11.04,  didn't even have to activate them
 nvidia 270.41.06, also sometimes when i click a window it wont totally grab it correctly
 also adobeair isnt in my synaptics.. not sure why this is a 64bit edition
 got adobeair 2 for 64 bit, had to do it myself as they dont release packages for the 64bit
 ok, even with me installing it, as a 64 bit myself it still wont install Dofus ... what is goin on here,
 also, its lagging horribly on updating xchat here, it took like 5 minutes and its lagging something terrible
 ok, so i just got kicked from my session also, like seriously someone got a good debian based derivative that works unlike ubuntu 11.04?? and not mint just transferred from it because its updates never worked properly
 bastidrazor: cant use 10.04 i have i7 toshiba laptop that wont allow any kernel before 2.6.35 to run properly , hence 10.04 uses like 2.6.32 i think so i can even get it to install
 bastidrazor: crappy is an opinion and point of perspective, to me it isn't crappy however, when an OS like ubuntu goes and changes all things and half those things are buggy and not just with my laptop but multiple machines in my home, i believe it is an OS issue
 bastidrazor: then most i7 laptops would be crappy under that statement, which is very untrue, like i said crappy is an opinion not fact, and i have multiple i7 computers which don't like kernels before 2.6.35...
 well, it looks like maybe a distro change is in order guess i could try fedora, maybe the got the wifi cards working this time
 aeon-ltd: just was using mint, however had an issue with repos with them they wouldn't always update correctly
 thats y i went back to ubuntu figured 11.04 might be good, since mint just didn't wanna work for me
 other thing is that i want the auto window resizing feature that 11.04 offers just not sure if anyother distro has that ability
 hey, what is the program name that allows for the resizing of the windows when dragged the right left or top??
 rgr?? explain... besides a few minor bugs im finding it to be not that bad now that I didn't a clean install, but did an upgrade from a clean install from 10.10 and so far so good, just need to resize some graphics issue that i had prior in 10.10
 /usr/share/icons
 klingan: /usr/share/icons/ in there should be gnome and others thats the only folder i know of that has the application icons
 hey has anyone had an issue with the gnome screensaver running rss-glx screensavers, like a bar seperating the screensaver near the top that is barely visible?? this is in ubuntu 11.04, just wanna know so I can make bug report, or if someone has a fix i may have over looked?
 Spaz_Dynamic: if your talking about a good media player manager for ubuntu look into banshee
 need to know if theres a way to get empathy to word wrap correctly when using IRC protocal??
 xangua: ive noticed, but at the current moment it works nicely, just wish word wrap worked with it, cuz currently the only way to enable word wrap is to remove the list that shows who is in the IRC
 anyone know why i just got kicked from my gnome session for no reason?
 anyone using the new ubuntu 11.04 get an issue with X.org server kicking from gnome session??
 flodine: id say 11.04 none of it is ready, even classic is giving some really bad bugs, like forcably kicking me from my session at random times and not showing any reason y
 flodine: got any good alternative to 11.04, i just want the snap windows and banshee integrated with my volume bar really, wish 10.10 just had snap windows and banshee instead of rhythmbox
 flodine: i totally agree, i always used mint, but since the implement of plymouth i haven't found a good OS that strayed from plymouth that i liked
 has anyone noticed a glitch like with the gnome screensaver on ubuntu 11.04?? just wondering if its just me or if this is common, with other people?? i have a nvidia 310M and i'm getting this issue
 robbier: what kind of wireless card??
 robbier: lspci | grep -i network in a terminal post that output
 just wanna make sure its seeing it on the hardware
 miedda: explain cant you just select auto connect?? and have it autoconnect you so your not typing the password every time??
 robbier: run lspci | grep -i network in terminal and post results, so i can make sure it the rite wifi card im looking for
 hey is there a way to have totem display the length of the current playing movie, in a script?? and if so how and how can i make the script get that in seconds and tell the computer to wait for the length of the movie in seconds
