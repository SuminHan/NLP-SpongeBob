 pidh, interesting, but i think it isnt related with vboxguestadditions. can you poste your Xorg.0.log client file
 alexander__, mention, that ubuntu will be released during the day
 andeeeuk, correct, will be released today
 MACscr, chromium in the repos is a modified version of the original google sources. better wait for updates from ubuntu, they modified some privacy things
 alexander__, usually I (from Germany) can upgrade around afternoon
 guest345345, it is mentioned in the user guide
 MACscr, it is, but usually you do not get the never version of a software, you get security updates (its like FF4, which wasnt released in 10.10)
 alexander__, same, they are going to upload it around that time
 MACsrc, we are both talking about ubuntu, right?
 MACsrc, im not sure if chromium 11 will be released in 11.04
 pidh, it could have something to do with your vbox settings
 pidh, did you modify your xorg.conf file?
 andeeeuk, sure?
 !ch | mavis
 damn
 pidh, did you correctly set your corg.conf file?
 MACsrc, https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/stable
 Rehan, Kubuntu is unbuntu with the more like windows looking KDE desktop. Ubuntu uses gnome
 pidh, I know, you have to create one
 pidh, sry, I was afk. try to change resolution with "xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768" or similar https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution
 Rehan, Is it as good as from a clean drive
 nick-nack, No
 Marco1, It will be released in the next hours. There is no exact release time
 cfc_{Pawpad}, it will be released today
 mythri, can you explain what you exactly did?
 mythri, yes, I allready read that
 mythri, I'm not sure about that, I think it recoverd the whole partition
 Macer, looks like gnome3
 MAcer, guest345345: http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/4641/gnome3vx2.png
 mythri, check out http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb545046 its not an ubuntu related question
 Macer, http://www.gnome3.org/
 guest345345, I think unity needs open source graphic card drivers
 Macer, and the big menu on the left side of the screen
 guest345345, plymouth is working for me. yeah I heard about unity 2D
 Macer, E17 / DR17 is great too
 guest345345, I think Im going to test it when Natty is released. But I think its no fun: the 2D version and a Quad-Core computer
 Macer, correct. I dont like e16 that much, but E17 is much better ;)
 guest345345, I think its working with the nouveau drivers, the proprietary drivers arent supported: http://askubuntu.com/questions/21427/does-unity-require-proprietary-graphics-card-drivers
 guest345345, yeah, I dont buy special cards, Im using the integrated graphic card
 Does someone have graphic card / Xorg related issues, here?
 !ask | citra-indah
 Rehan, drivers tells us alot about the hardware, they won't show you how exactly their hardware works
 11.04 seems to be out: http://releases.ubuntu.com/natty/ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso
 nevermind
 rverrips, nevermind, its the beta
 andeeeuk, no, its from 26. April
 andeeeuk, just thought it was the final
 andeeeuk, come on, I wont to test it -.-
 guest345345; I agree, but new releases are allways great for me. If it wouldn't be that great for me I would use debian ;)
 elzoog, you can make an usb stick eprsistent and non-persistent
 elzoog, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
 guest345345, it worked great for me the last time i tried it (10.10)
 guest345345, I dont like live usb sticks that much. They seems to be slowlier then live cds.
 andeeeuk, it is
 elzoog, correct. a persistent usb stick got that option
 dreinull_, its the beta release
 dreinull_, nut sure about that, it was updated today, so it could be the final release
 guest345345, you can install packages with apt-get on the live usb stick
 guest345345, uff Im not sure about that. dont you have an easier solution for that?
 http://www.kubuntu.org/ changed
 vadviktor, negative.: it takes me to http://releases.ubuntu.com/natty/ubuntu-11.04-beta2-desktop-i386.iso
 vadviktor, Im upgrading, not downloading images ;)
 cleared cache, cant confirm that. Its Beta2
 Still not released in the update manager
 guest345345, Ok, I can confirm that know ;)
 proq, wubi sint supported in windows 7, sorry
 *isnt
 proq, it could be supported yet, I dont know. I had the same problem with wubi. check back if you use the latest wubi release
 proq, you could cancel it earlier ;)
 proq, the wubi installation should take around 5 minutes
 proq, after the download
 Oh Im so excited, WUBAWUBAWU :D nevermind. I heard 11.04 is going to bereleased in 10 minutes
 daskog, here
 daskog, im running kubuntu. when i have to use PS im starting win 7 in virtualbox
 andeeeuk, 11.04 isnt released yet
 jatt, yes but not in the repos
 Marco1, I heard in 7 minutes
 guest345345, http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/chromium (German) says, that chromium in the repo is modified
 nyoger, chromium is modified by the distributors
 guest345345, I am german, lol
 linxfreaker, its released, but not in the repo yet
 tsimpson, http://releases.ubuntu.com/natty/
 32bit is allways better
 jiltdil, 32bit got a better hardware support, things like flash won't work with 64bit properly
 KM0201, I can see still today a lot of 64bit related issues, were is no reason to change to 64bit (except the unix-time-problem)
 eltrige, the latest flash version uses the experimental hardware acceleration, that could causes trouble
 jatt, I agree here
 scarra3, Im using 32bit with PAE -> better compatibility
 crashanddie or gnome or another desktop
 rgr, it isnt
 rgr, its an own developement of canonical
 crashaddie, Im using KDE ;)
 rgr, correct
 jatt, Im going to test unity in a couple of minutes. but im not sure about unity. I got a proprietary graphic card driver
 damicita, no support for proprietary graphic cards
 g4, repos
 g4, http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/unity
 did he say "hell"?
 zetheroo, yes, all proprietary graphic cards arent supported in unity-3D
 karlhunt, did you try the latest manline kernel?
 zetheroo, intel drivers arent proprietary, as I remember
 zetheroo, otherwise try unity-2D
 karlhunt, are you using 11.04?
 karlhunt, Im not sure about the kernel version, what was it again in Natty?
 karlhunt, yeah, that looks actual. I read something about the sandy bridge drivers in the changelog. cant remember if it was 2.6.38 or 2.6.39
 zetheroo, I wasn't talking to you?
 dammit, I can't upgrade
 whooot, I cant upgrade :D can someone have a look: http://pastebin.com/ac3tH5g5
 jaredquinn, yeah.. but not ubuntu studio... any idea how I can upgrade? (or which package that causes? (maybe xorg))
 jaredquinn, line 588 could cause that problem
 falxx, isnt related with the KDE ppa
 falxx, pls paste /var/log/dist-upgrade/ files
 zvacet, isn't working (it is working but doesnt fix it), because all dependencies are correct. it seems to be a too new xorg version, so I have to fix it by hand
 zvacet, im still in 10.10
 jaredquinn, yes. did you look at line 588?
 jaredquinn, http://pastebin.com/ac3tH5g5 no
 this **** log files doesnt tell me anything :D
 falxx, link?
 falxx, look at line 438
 genupulas, he cant upgrade
 falxx, are you sure, tha package "amd64" is in the repo? that package seems to be the reason
 genupulas, he said it isn't working, wer are analysing the log files now
 falxx, "ure"?
 falxx.. i never said "ure" *confused* or right.. the package ure... yeah, that could cause the problem
 genupulas, its a log file (var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log
 jbwiv___, it was, reload cache
 !ask | psydoll
 kellnola, yes, gimp 3 is to be released soon
 kellnola, they got a slow programming progress ;)
 VlRUS, are u using Unity?
 VlRUS, sure you arent?
 william2, better try "sudo start gdm" or "sudo stop gdm"
 sdh, I think so too
 An_Ony_Moose
 An_Ony_Moose, did you google the issue. sry
 An_Ony_Moose, it could be an issue related to your hardware. sounds like a problem with overheating or in general something like that (energy saving?). Or it could be that you press the wrong buttons
 thegoodcushion, you can try to change the update server to a local one instead of the generl servers
 DarkStar1, explain the exact problem
 can't upgrade
 DarkStar1, sometimes ubuntu tries to find the right configuration and you dont have a configuration file by default (like xorg.conf), so you have to create it. or did it change the "position" / directory?
 An_Ony_Moose, I can't help you with that, sry
 DarkStar1, /etc/X11/xorg.conf doesn't exist too, you have to create that file first
 DarkStar1, that could help: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-server-73/openldap-error-cant-find-slapd-conf-721784/
 zniavre, did you try unity-2d?
 zniavre, which graphic card are you using?
 riktking, yes
 ActionParsnip, i thought Unity-3D isnt supported with proprietary nvidie drivers?
 ActionParsnip, acording to http://askubuntu.com/questions/21427/does-unity-require-proprietary-graphics-card-drivers it isnt.
 ActionParsnip, ar, you are right. I found that and it says proprietary drivers are working: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DemystifyingUnityGraphicsHardwareRequirements
 ActionParsnip, "/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p" is interesting
 stupid ugisozols got a working 11.04 -.- :D
 Flynsarmy, choose gnome at startup / login screen
 bercik_, yes, with apt-get dist-upgrade
 Pici, that is also working with the desktop edition?
 Pici, thx
 DeathKnight, I remember 8.04 as unusuable ;)
 DeathKnight, no, 8.04 was unusable. I was using Debian at that time. It got better with 8.10
 someone know that error (I know it is german): 2011-04-28 13:45:38,575 ERROR Dist-upgrade failed: 'E:Fehler: Unterbrechungen durch pkgProblemResolver::Resolve hervorgerufen; dies kÃ¶nnte durch gehaltene Pakete verursacht worden sein.'
 rgr, correct. should I translate?
 rgr, yeah but Im not sure which package is causing that issue. Im installing ubuntu-desktop right now and hope that fixed it
 rgr, Do you know a way to find out, which packages are "hold"
 How can I found out which packages are "hold" (or locked?) ?
 Flynsarmy, pidgin isn't the default IM software anymore
 Flynsarmy, its the same in KDE, KDE doesn't want you to use any other instand messenger then Kopete
 TheRedOctober, I still try to install Natty :D
 TheRedOctober, :D I got some strange dependency errors. tell me if you have some issues with the installation
 saml, wait, you pressed the button and the desktop was suddenly broken?
 saml, you can try the comand line way
 khr0n0s, paste "/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p"
 Dr_Willis|2, I think it doesn't pass the unity test, he said he got that error
 khr0n0s, uhm, and you got unity installed?
 TheRedOctober, nice. can you paste /var/log/dist-upgrade/ files?
 kr0n0s, gnome or kde or something else?
 khr0n0s, are you in gnome right now?
 khr0n0s, That error tells you, that you can't use Unity. are you planning to use Unity?
 khr0n0s, Unity is a new desktop which isn't completly stable yet
 How can I fix "An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade: E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.?

 moshe_, your welcome
 avij, a netbook version doesnt exist: http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.04/
 AAAAAAAAAAAGHAHA.. i cant upgrade
 Pici, if upgrade fails, do you recommend to fix it or a fresh installation?
 ChogyDan, "An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade: E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages."
 ChogyDan, ok, thank you. It could be related with xorg
 ChogyDan, I used a wrong ppa some time ago, have a look: http://pastebin.com/6itQQtTz
 ChogyDan, I can't figure out which package exactly is causing that problem, otherwise I could fix  it
 ChogyDan, I got an error. translated: virtual packages coudln't be removed
 ChogyDan, I read it could be related with the gnome-desktop package, im trying to install that (so I have to downgrade Firefox 4 because of dependencys)
 ChogyDan, empty
 ChogyDan, apt.log
 ChogyDan, yes, main.log
 ChogyDan, it got just 7 lines, nothing important
 ChogyDan, http://pastebin.com/BY8W6mgT
 ChogyDan, any Idea how to compare the installed versions with the repo versions and how to downgrade the packages?
 ToeKutter, your welcome
 ChogyDan, and for several / all packages?
 ChogyDan, I tried that before, nothing happens (Im currently install ubuntu-desktop)
 *installing
 MK``, it could be great, if you are able to install it ;)
 bakanub, does that issue only appear in unity?
 ChogyDan, with the ^?
 bakanub, yes, 10.10 wasnt using unity by default. you used gnome before, right?
 ChogyDan, one minute ;)
 yellow7, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
 cholo, dist-upgrade wont show release notifications, try "update-manager"
 cholo, did you use the beta version before?
 cholo, so its updating like normal package updates, not like a release upgrade
 ChogyDan, should I retry to upgrade after that command (which I didnt run yet)
 bkerensa, change repos to a local server instead of the general server
 ChogyDan, "libpolkit-gobject-1-0 : Stört: libpolkit-gtk-1-0 (< 0.99) aber 0.96-2ubuntu4 soll installiert werden" sry ik its german, should i translate?

 ChogyDan, the only error
 ChogyDan, lets ignore that. Im restarting the upgrade thing
 ChogyDan, "libpolkit-gobject-1-0 : Disrupt: libpolkit-gtk-1-0 (< 0.99) but 0.96-2ubuntu4 should be installed"

 flo, ?
 ChogyDan, nothing. nothing to install, nothing to fix, ...
 ChogyDan, let me try the upgrade
 ChogyDan, yeah that could be, but apt-get install -f doesnt show up any dependency errors
 ChogyDan, still isntalling
 ChogyDan, !#%$& still not working
 Shaggy2, have you got a problem with booting into 11.04?
 Nunya, have you issues with installing 11.04?
 Nunya, can you paste /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log ?
 Shaggy2, did you try the rescue mode? could be a dependency error with plymouth
 KNUBBIG, nevermind. that wont work here ;)
 KNUBBIG, sudo killall * :D
 Shaggy2, try to boot into the terminal via rescue mode and type "sudo apt-get -f install" and/or try "sudo aptitude", it can fix dependecy errors better
 !language | Shaggy2
 Nunya, pls paste "cat /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log | grep broken" vor better overview
 nUNYA, AND PASTE MAIN.LOG IN THE SAME DIR AND (IF NOT EMPTY) ALSO (apt-)term.log (sry, caps lock)
 Nunya, sry, i meant "cat /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log | grep Broken"
 gartral, sure? you can also boot gnome from kdm and kde from gdm?
 MennaEssa, you mean plymouth? try to boot in rescue mode and look if dependencies are correct
 Nunya, ? and optionally paste "apt-cache policy gnome-user-guide"
 m|kael, yes, goto the sound settings and turn "mute" off and check if the right hardware is selected. didnt work for me either, because "hdmi output" was selected as default sound device
 Nunya, the last one is a command
 Nunya, don't forget the main.log
 m|kael, still not working?
 m|kael, you'r welcome
 Nunya, are you sure the first output is the file /var/log-dist-upgrade/main.log ?
 Nunya, I don't think so, are you sure?
 Nunya, the output of "cat /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log" / the content of that file
 boneseer, you type "chroot /PATH" to be able to run commands in your old system
 Nunya, strange. The issue seems to be everything from line 150 to line 170
 Nunya, it looks like it cannot recognize the free space ("<DistUpgradeCache.FreeSpace object at 0x3f762d0>" line 150)
 Nunya, I found several websites, were the same error appeared: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1274731
 Shaggy2, vibhav, not the Grub rescue mode
 nunya, actually these are DEBUG infos, Im not sure if this caused the problem
 Nunya, are you sure about that? it doesnt look like everything failed with that upgrade
 Nunya, you didn't restart since the upgrade, correct?
 !ask | Vustom
 Nunya, we can look if all dependeces matches or you could simply reconfigure every package. I hope that works
 *dependencies
 Shaggy2, so even grub isn't starting?
 Nunya, let's first check the dependencies. just to be sure, you upgraded your computer and it suddenly closed the update window and you didn't restart since then, correct?
 Vustom, please ask your question
 Vustom, nevermind
 Vustom, the problem is, that when you removed the linux partition you also removed the grub files in /boot/grub, which grub needs to start.
 Vustom, Fix the mbr with a windows bootloader
 Nunya, and it stopped at this point?
 Vustom, there are several ways to do this, e.g. http://www.pronetworks.org/forums/how-to-restore-vista-boot-loader-t76643.html this isn't an ubuntu related question, you can find some solutions by googling "bootloader restore"
 Nunya, interesting Font. Lets try "sudo stop cups"
 Nunya, and paste output if errors appear
 LjL, are you sure its chinese?
 LjL, yes, it's chinese
 Nunya, and the upgrade process doesn't continue?
 Nunya, try "sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart"
 Skei, can you paste "dmesg"?
 robin0800, the old "sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart" doesn't work anymore?
 Nunya, nevermind. type "sudo start cups"
 Nunya, that was just luck. you're welcome
 Skei, I think Intel Sany Bridge isn't yet fully supported in the linux kernel
 !ask | mansoor
 Skei, line 711 "[   12.440031] agpgart-intel 0000:00:00.0: Intel Sandybridge Chipset"
 Shaggy2, are you using a nvidia graphic card?
 Shaggy2, your graphic card driver isn't loading, imo. You could download the binary driver from nvidia.com and install it by hand. You got 3 screens?
 Shaggy2, can you paste /var/log/Xorg.0.log just to make sure its a problem with the driver?
 Skei, according to some websites the sandy bridge should be supported, but mention that some hardware and some features aren't supported yet ( http://phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?29110-Intel-s-Linux-Sandy-Bridge-Graphics-Still-Troubling )
 Shaggy2, can you paste the log file?
 !paste | Shaggy2
 Skei, not yet, IMO. It could work with the next kernel 2.6.39 or the mainline kernel, Im not sure if something changed in this kernel
 Skei, oh, you didn't said that you are using 10.10.. I thought you use 11.04 because this channel now supports 11.04. Yes, there is a high chance, that it will work
 axle, you are running 11.04?
 BlouBlou, correct, not the graphical way
 Skei, failed for me to, I had to downgrade some ( a lot of) packages, that the dependencies matched
 axle, after the upgrade? sure intel sandy bridge is working correctly? ;)
 Skei, it was my fault, I installed foreign package repos ;)
 !ubuntu | section5
 !op | section5
 Pici, sorry
 axle, so it stopped working?
 axle, sry, I can't help you with that ;) I think Im going to test Natty now (restarting)
 Nunya ;D
 Skei, I hope the upgrade is solving your problem
 muneeb, http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/flashplugin-installer
 back. Unity is disappointing in 11.04
 coz_, it's not working for me (and gnome looks ugly and is old) :D I'm using KDE, just wanted to test Unity
 coz_ both, gnome classic is working as usual, and Unity isn't shown up correctly
 coz_ I can just see the files on my desktop in Unity, nothing else (no menus, etc, except the right click menü), opening these files is working. Im using Nvidia with the proprietary driver (GT220)
 coz_, I did that, nothing appeared (I'm currently in KDE)
 coz_, I am open for other desktop too ;) (But I don't like the concept of gnome and it is hard to handle with dualscreen)
 coz_, nevermind, just wanted to test unity, but seems to be released to early ;)
 coz_, thats what I like at KDE. Both screens got their own task bar and the window list just lists these windows, which are on the same screen
 zap0, yes
 studentz, I had the same problem. Run jockey and enable the driver with that
 knick, thank you
 coz_, http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/incident.png
 jw_, no, everbody is making a fresh Installation
 Dr_Willis, I used a local mirror with full speed
 zap0, yes, a graphical editor with su rights
 zap0, but try "nano", its an easy command line editor, simpler then vim
 zap0, you can change the sources in the software center too
 Soothsayer, did you boot unity one time since then?

 Belinrahs, he left

 Nunya, this stupid cups. type "sudo stop cups && sudo start cups"
 jAguAr, you used foreign repos, pls paste /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log
 Nunya, reuse that command if it cups stucks the next time ;)
 jAguAr`, I know, I don't need the whole file, better paste "cat /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log | grep Broken"
 myrkaverk, are you using "new" hardware?
 !cn | jml__
 myrkraverk, you could try a live cd, but there is no gwarranty that it will work

 Nunya, you are welcome
 myrkraverk, you could try a live cd, but there is no warranty that it will work
 myrkraverk, I allways prefer new software over old, otherwise I would use Debian
 roeland, 400%? Do you use a quad core computer?
 roeland, sure all 4 kernels are at 100%? Usually when a process hangs my computer just one core is affected (100%) -> 25% of all cores and the system is still usable. Do you use the 64bit version?
 Leapo, http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux_kernel_regress2&num=4
 Leopo, it could be also Unity, did you try gnome instead? Im not sure if unity consumpts more power, because of the effects
 jatt?
 !Natty | matt[vic[
 mtlife, same for me, Unity isn't working for you
 mtlife, because it doesn't support your graphic card?
 mtlife, some people say it is working with proprietary drivers but it isn't working with some proprietary drivers, so another requirement would be open source drivers. same for me, mtlife, Unity isn't stable yet
 mtlife, yes. did you try unity-2D?
 mtlife, thx for that information
 Can someone in maverick pls paste "apt-cache policy libavdevice52"?
 ActionParsnip, are packages from "maverick-updates" repo automatically updated or is that a backport repo?
 ActionParsnip, jAguAr` got a depedency error when upgrading to Natty: http://paste.ubuntu.com/600759/ . all package numbers looks normal and I can't see any reason why it should output that "InstVer" error
 SoftTimur, about:config is a Firefox command, correct?
 usr13, I know that, but thank you
 ActionParnsip, Im pretty sure lines 2 to 12 are causing that problem
 TheNuts, :D
 NyvenZA, are you running KDE?
 ActionParnisp, ah, its opens "about:config" as a link with the default browser, and that was firefox for him
 Altheas, same happens to me
 Altheas, I heard you have to install compiz-gnome, that didn't work for me. I think some packages are missing and the dependencies are just wrong / buggy. Unity 2D works for me
 Altheas, roger. I will look for a solution
 Who got problems with Upgrading to 11.04?
 snowrichard, I had to download 2,5 GB :D
 lumbert, are you sure USB 3.0 is supported in your linux kernel? (Are you using 11.04?)
 Tweaky, pls paste /var/log-dist-upgrade/apt.log and main.log
 Braiam, launcher maybe?
 Tweaky, this error is caused by unmatched dependencies when you use foreign repos
 Jordan_U, I will help Tweaky fixing the dependencies
 Tweaky, pls paste the files
 resc_user_2649, is grub shown up correctly?
 Tweaky, it was a type, /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log and main.log
 Tweaky, I meant a *typo, sry, its early in the morning here ;)
 test, you can also try the classic gnome. Pls ask in one line next time
 Tweaky, ok, I can see the problem on the first look
 Tweaky, you used foreign graphic driver repos. pls paste "cat /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log | grep Broken"
 test, the standard desktop is now Unity. you can choose the classic gnome when logging in
 test, ist there an option "Ubuntu Classic"?
 arnab, Kubuntu is working perfectly for me - Unity is not.
 test, it is gnome 2.32 at the moment. the newer version is gnome3
 !gnome3 | test
 Tweaky, now paste "apt-cache policy xserver-xorg-core"
 nadaram, are you sure you are talking to me?
 arnab, just install "kubuntu-desktop" and give it a try ;)
 nandaram, of course, but I don't know how to force Xorg to start in a special tty. whats the exact problem?
 Tweaky, Ah, as I expected
 Jordan_U, test, nadaram left. And what do I not understand?
 arnab, Im not sure, I heard that you can simpley remove "kubuntu-desktop", but that never worked for me. I use a lot "aptitude autoclean" and "apt-get autoremove"
 test, are you using 11.10?
 Tweaky, its goot that we found the solution, but the solution isn't that easy, you have to start the upgrade several times after we fixed it and that takes a lot time
 Tweaky, first you have to disable all foreign repo sources
 test, I think oneiric got gnome too: http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/gnome
 Tweaky, every repo, that is not ubuntu.com
 Tweaky, then create an empty directory in your home dir, that we can download several deb files. I'll prepare a long command for you, that will take some time
 !nouveau | sudipta
 !grub | resc_user_2649
 sudipta, install it the graphical way (jockey)

 vibhav, am I still muted?
 Tweaky, don't mistype my name ;) are you sure you typed the command correctly?
 Tweaky, try http://paste.ubuntu.com/601205/ otherwise try the same command in the paste with aptitude download instead of apt-get download
 pfifo, :D
 Flynsarmy, it doesn't break Unity-3D, it gives you an extra option
 resc_user_2649, use that guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
 Susanna, did you try to start the classic gnome and did that work properly? If not try it
 atlef, correct
 Tweaky, type "sudo aptitude update" and repeat the aptitude download command
 PresuntoRJ, is grub showing up?
 PresuntoRJ, could be a grub-only issue, did you try to recover grub?
 !grub > PresuntoRJ
 gurmal, you can't downgrade because the every kernel is installed seperatly. just install an older version
 Renski, choose Ubuntu Classic at the login screen
 CooKieMonster, you are still using 8.04?
 CooKieMonster, which version of 8.04? 8.04.4 LTS? is that still supported?
 Tweaky, is it working?
 voidr, can you paste /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
 Timelight, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/728969
 Giles, you could try Unity-2D, while you are in gnome
 Giles, there are several issues with proprietary drivers in Unity
 Giles, yes. line 292, [    28.728] (EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)
 Giles, you got two graphic cards? whats the second one?
 Giles, nevermind, wrong person ;)
 voidr, you use two graphic cards? which is the second one?
 Giles, that is correct, both cards are smiliar I think (its just one of them, doesnt matter)
 voidr, and you prefer the intel or the nvidia? Ah I see, you use Sandybridge. The integrated GPU isn't supported yet
 Giles, not in his case, Intel card isnt working here. try "/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p "
 Tweaky, enable standard repos and disable the "sarvatt" repo
 Giles, are you using Natty (11.04)?
 voidr, try: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/disable-integrated-graphics-before-new-card-install-513665/ disable the Intel graphic card, according to phoronix some GPUs from intelsandybridge aren't supported yet
 voidr, I think the Sandybridge will be fully supported later this year
 Giles, it could be that not all packages are installed / upgraded properly. check the dependencies
 Tweaky, pls paste /etc/apt/sources.list
 Giles, try "aptitude" and "sudo apt-get install -f"
 Chepoll, please tell us more details in your question, maybe someone will answer it then
 Tweaky, "sudo aptitude clean && sudo aptitude update && sudo apt-get update", then try the aptitude download command again (use copy-paste, its faster)
 Hamza, this isn't an ubuntu related question, try it in #linux
 Tweaky, no
 Hamza, but Linux Mint to, so it's a kernel issue
 Ubuntu123, did you try to remove and reinstall?
 bazhang, he just doesn't want to accept, that that is a kernel issue
 lifeofguenter, most linux distributions got a firewall (her iptables)
 lifeofguenter, there is another "firewall" app, I can't remember the name, moment
 lifeofguenter, SElinux and/or apparmor
 Tweaky, where is the main repo?
 Giles, No. Did you restart your computer and tried to select the Unity desktop again?
 Tweaky, nevermind, its in line 5 i think
 Tweaky, I have no Idea why you can't download these packages. I think you have to download all of these by hand (packages.ubuntu.com, allways from "maverick")
 Giles, I don't know, I'm using KDE. Unity isn't working for me
 Tweaky, so please download them in one directory (also the "security" packages)
 !gnome3 | andeeeuk
 andeeeuk, "safe downgrading is not possible."
 Tweaky, write me if you finished
 kaban, reinstall fglrx
 loseweighttttttt, are you suing opensuse?
 bazhang, I think its the opensuse "apt-get"
 or centos
 loseweighttttttt, change the mirror. and dont ask here
 dooglus, looks like a typo
 dooglus, http://server is not a valid server
 andeeeuk, install another desktop, remove gnome and reinstall gnome again
 dooglus, it could be that something had changed, that it doesn't work anymore
 bazhang, he installed gnome3 and is trying to revert to gnome2
 loseweighttttttt, should I call OP?
 still downloading, Tweaky?
 loseweighttttttt, canonical got a good support for companys
 dibs, you used foreign repo sources, pls poste "apt.log"
 *paste
 Neo_Kipl1ng, apt-get isn't supposed to upgrade your system, try "update-manager"
 !upgrade | Neo_Kipl1ng
 Neo_Kipl1ng, "-d" means, that you upgrade to the next unstable version, which isn't released yet, try without "-d"
 kaban, did 10.10 work for you? something is buggy with the driver, or your hardware isn't supported "[   228.444] (WW) fglrx(0): board is an unknown third party board, chipset is supported"
 dibs, now paste same file, but with: "cat apt.log | grep Broken"
 kaban, sounds like a regression to me, I would report that as bug to the ubuntu bug tracker.. sry, can't help you with that issue
 Vustom, I think they are located in a config file, not in a folder
 kaban, do you think that will fix it? I would try the live cd (or a persistent live usb stick) first
 Mrokii, enable them in "jockey"
 Mrokii, type it in the application search form, it will be shown up as "hardware drivers" or something
 Neo_K1pl1ing, you can simply run "do-release-upgrade -mode=Normal"
 Mrokii, but the driver is listed in the list in that application?
 kaban, or a perstistent usb stick, im not sure if fglrx is used as default graphic card driver in the live cd
 dibs, i think you can save it in a file by adding " > FILE.XYZ" at the end of the command
 muneeb, that could help: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1721273

 cousin_mario, you're welcome
 dibs, try "sudo aptitude download network-manager" and install it with "sudo dpkg -i network-manager*.deb"
 Thank you, Jordan_U. dibs, and do you really need awant-window-navigator? its causing problems, pls remove that too
 Mrokii, paste "glxinfo"
 jigynet, are you using 10.10?
 jigynet, that was fixed in 11.04, it happend to me in 10.10 too
 jigynet, its related with the new hardware acceleration feature of adobes flashplugin
 dibs, I need another paste. pleas apt.log again with "cat apt.log | grep Breaks"
 dibs, and type "sudo apt-get remove awn-settings-trunk python-awn-trunk avant-window-navigator-trunk awn-applets-c-core-trunk awn-applets-python-core-trunk awn-applets-c-extras-trunk  avant-window-navigator-data-trunk  awn-applets-python-extras-trunk
 dibs, pls paste "apt-cache policy network-manager"
 Nece228, it is supposed to work, yes
 lucas, but the login screen is shwoing up?
 Nece228, should work with the proprietary driver too
 lucas, it doesn't seem to be an unity issue, more a gdm issue. try to reinstall gdm (/or try kdm instead). is the boot logo plymouth shown up?
 lucas, no
 dibs, it could be that awn prevented the system from upgrading, try it again.
 lucas, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lsb/+bug/752393 could be related
 dibs, try if it works. one of these packages is causing the issue
 lucas, are you still using the alpha or beta release?
 !flash | Soothsayer
 lucas, strange. sry, I dont know how to fix that
 dibs, still here? pls paste "apt-cache policy libreoffice-core"
 andeeeuk, I allready told u: remove gnome(3) completly and remove the gnome3 ppa and install gnome again
 Mrokii, whats the exact problem you got atm? Unity isn't working, right?
 dibs, this command is just looking up version numbers, so yes
 Mrokii, could be a wrong error, are all 3D things like games still working?
 andeeeuk, I would install another smaller desktop (like xubuntu-desktop), log into that and remove gnome
 dibs, I need the new "apt.log (grep Broken)"
 dibs, the mirror seems to be uncomplete, try an official mirror and it should work
 dibs, the mirror doesn't deliver packages like libreoffice-style and thats the reason why the upgrade fails
 !ccsm | mah454
 dibs, there are several other problems packages that causes problems
 lol: "CTCP VERSION-Anfrage von hxing_!~hxing@119.4.252.88 erhalten"
 PresuntoRJ, she could also use the classic gnome
 PresuntoRJ, kezzawd, I think a new derivative called gubuntu will be created
 MACscr, e17, lxde, kde, or gubuntu ;)
 PresuntoRJ, wireless?
 PresuntoRJ, and irc is still working?
 dibs, foreign (unsupported) package repos prevents the system from upgrading. Try the official ppa, after that you could change back to your repo
 PresuntoRJ, sry, I don't know anything about that ;) is your network card recognized and is it working properly?
 MACsrc,  Canonical tries to increase the amount of desktop computer with ubuntu and they know, that gnome is not the best solution for modern desktop ("multimedia") computer
 _3dioot, are you using Natty (11.04)?
 MACscr, but the normal non-nerd user want a beautiful system, and gnome isn't beautiful in my oppinion ;)
 dibs, you don't need to uninstall anything, just disable these unsupported repos and activate the officials
 PresuntoRJ, sry, I can't help you. you could fill out a bug rebort on the ubuntu bug tracker
 MACsrc, but if the "good-lucking" windows works as good as the "ugly" gnome, why should you prefer ubuntu? ;)
 PresuntoRJ, create a bug report from another computer and copy the information from yours ;)
 PresuntoRJ, I don't know, ask the people in the bug tracker, after you opened the bug report ;)
 BRB
 dibs, I hope that fixed it. Im off for 10-20 minutes
 dibs, ok, then me then if it worked or not
 dibs, is it working?
 dibs, pls paste the new apt.log
 dibs, its 23 o'clock?
 dibs, leet? ^^
 dibs, ? :D
 dibs, lets try "sudo apt-get -f install" and "sudo aptitude" look for broken dependencies with aptitude
 dibs, the second thing: can you remove "libnss3" without removing alot of other packages?
 dibs, pls paste: "apt-cache policy libeet1 libnss3-1d libnm-util1 chromium-browser librpmio1 xulrunner-1.9.2 chromium-browser-l10n gnome-pilot enna gnome-pilot-conduits  openshot"
 !classic | saju_m
 dibs, libnss3 seems to be the cause of most of these errors, woulb be easier without it. did it work?
 Al-Bawi, if it's not reachable try a mirror
 !mirror | Al-Bawi
 dibs, "libeet1" is outdated, could you update? and pls paste the output of which package will be removed, if you would remove that libnss3
 !nss
 dibs, no, don't remove these, just give me the output
 !centos | loseweight
 ubottu -.-
 dibs, Im confused. Hit No. that package doesn't even exist in the official repos: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&searchon=names&keywords=libnss3
 dibs, for maverick
 dibs, that package shoudln't have any dependencies, it could be that this happens because the other packages arent from the official repo too
 dibs, hm, what?
 dibs, I wouldn't remove thoose packages
 Osmodivs, ignore that error
 Osmodovis, it will be shown a lot of times, but you can ignore it. that doesn't say anything
 dibs, dude, I have no Idea how to fix that. its because you used this unofficial mirror
 dibs, sure? they miss a lot of packages and some packages differ from the original
 dibs, try "dpkg --configure -a" and paste output
 dibs, thats a good sign
 dibs, http://paste.ubuntu.com/601281/ lines 1149, 1150, 1151, 1164, 1165, 1166, 1167, 1182, 1183, 1184 and 1193 seems to cause your main problem. I think this are these packages, which prevent your system from beeing updated, because it couldn't resolv the dependencies of that packages
 ThisNameisCool, isn't python 2.7 default in 11.04?
 santhu1984, pls ask in one line and pls paste /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log
 memefilter, 32bit isn't more stable then 64bit, but I prefer 32 because of its compatibility
 Curarion, isn't a persistent Live USB stick easier?
 Cursarion, persistent means, that any changes are saved on the usb sticks and not overridden when you reboot
 ubuntu, to run the xserver it will require a graphic card, yes.
 Stereocaulon, /var/log/dist-upgrade/ apt.log and main.log
 Stereocaulon, where did it stop?
 Stereocaulon, ty
 dibs, still not working?
 Stereocaulon, and the main.log
 Stereocaulon, ok, I see. Is that dutch? pls run "sudo dpkg --configure -a"
 Stereocaulon, yeah, I allways have to translate things here, if I got a question ;) and pls paste the results of that command
 Stereocaulon, lets concentrate on the packages mentioned in main.log at the end (> line 169)
 Stereocaulon, try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure python"
 Stereocaulon, btw it's not safe to reboot. the TTYs will work, but not the nvidia driver nor metacity
 sl33k_, depending on your settings durin installation
 sl33k_, of course, when you're partitioning your disk you can select if you want to remove ther other os's or if you want to have dualboot

 dibs, don't forget to reinstall "ubuntu-desktop" to match all dependencies
 dibs, roger, and before you restart

 expedion, remove that japanese thing
 expedion, sorry, I can't help you ;) I'm using KDE

 Stereocaulon_, perfect. I go to go ;)
 expedion, ram and hd, yes ;)
 Stereocaulon_, ty, you too ;)
 Dr_Willis, I agree, I'm using a PAE-Kernel ;)

 Eduard, have you tried the official driver from nvidia.com?
 Eduard, http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us
 Eduard, an Nouveau is not an option?
 Eduard, you could unpack the deb file and copy every file to the right directory and hope that this will work
 Eduard, or you change the dependencies of the deb, dont know how to do that

 ajah, yes, wine.
 jaha, and don't forget vmware and vbox

 ubuntu, the second unlocated disk space is just 1MB big, I think that wouldn't make any sense
 Dr_Willis, I allways hate that, because it have to move a lot of files ;)
 ubuntu, ah, right. That would take a lot of time, since you are trying to move more then 500GB of data. Why dont you just resize /dev/sda/?
 ubuntu, hm, nevermind, I meant 20 GB of data
 ubuntu, it doesn't affect your data, is just moving the location of the data on your disk, and thats taking some time (like if you would copy all the files somewhere else)
 ubuntu, I've never lost any data due to resizing. There is a little risk, that this could happen, but it never happend to me
 ubuntu, and one of the two partitons you try to move is a swap partition, but I would make a backup of /dev/sda7
 InHisName, pls paste /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log and main.log
 ubuntu, then you would have more swap space (ignore the 1MB). Whats your ram size?
 Herbs, as long as his swap space is big enough
 Herbs, I disagree here
 Herbs, ubuntu, usually swap space = ram * 2
 constl, Herbs, if you want to hibernate (suspend to disk) u need more swap then ram
 Herbs, hibernating stopped working for me since 11.04 anyway
 !testdisk | ubuntu
 omg ubottu. ubuntu-, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestDisk
 constl, as long as you suspend to ram, everything will work fine for you
 ubuntu_, it's also for recoverying lost partitions/ a lost partition table
 ubuntu_, your current partition table looks ok. you could move sda7 and sda5 up and combine these 9.99GB with these 979MB
 !ext4 | thegoodcushion
 ubottu doesn't know anything

 trailoryo, VLC is working for me. Usually thats more a hardware/driver problem then a media player issue
 trailoryo, you can choose different video output modes
 trailoryo, in Vlc, yes. VLC uses its own codecs and VLC supports hardware acceleration. If your graphic card/driver doesn't support hardware acceleration it wont work
 trailoryo, pls paste "glxinfo | grep rendering"

 DogEars, which guest os are you planning to run with it?
 DogEars, I'm running Windows 7 Enterprise
 DogEars, lol, I'm running photoshop and illustrator inside that virtual machine and it's running flawless ;)
 DogEars, I think the upgrade removed the non-ose version, so it's ose now. Both working great

 Dr_Willis, I allways wonder how ubuntu can broke working things ;) I can't hibernate anymore since upgrade, grubs text isn't shown correctly, unity isn't working, and and and :D
