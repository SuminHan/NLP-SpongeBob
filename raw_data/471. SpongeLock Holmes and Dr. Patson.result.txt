SpongeBob:	 Surf's up!  Oww! I don't have my keys!
Patrick:	 Well, where could they be?
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, this looks like a job for SpongeLock Holmes and Dr. Patson. 
SpongeLock:	 The keys are found.
Dr. Patson:	 How?
SpongeLock:	  Elementary, my dear Patson!  Behold! 'Twas your sticky buns that found them. But how did Patrick get all sticky?
Dr. Patson:	  Intriguing.
