SpongeBob:	 You're nothing! Is all that grime meant to scare me, Mr. Mirror? I've met sardines tougher than you are. Time to put you in your place.  Looking good, mirror! Sorry about the harsh words.  Now to attack these floors!
Mr. Krabs:	  Are you kidding? He's an absolute treasure to have around the restaurant!
SpongeBob:	  Sounds like Mr. Krabs is bragging about me again to his associates. 
Mr. Krabs:	 And he's been with me for such a long time now.
SpongeBob:	  I am.
Mr. Krabs:	 But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let the little guy go today.
SpongeBob:	 Yep, he's gonna have to--   What? Let the little guy go?! Little guy? Who's the little guy? It must be either me, or  Squidward!  Phew! I  taller. You're the little guy, Squidsy!
Squidward:	  No, and I want you to stop calling me Squidsy. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Squidward looked taller there for a second. Better get a more accurate measurement. 
Squidward:	 What do you think you're doing?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, just seeing which one of us is the little guy...  ...and it looks like it  you!
Squidward:	 No, I'm not! 
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, wait!  We haven't measured with my legs at full extension yet! 
Squidward:	  I don't care! Now get back in the kitchen!
SpongeBob:	 You'll care when you find out what's gonna happen to the little guy. WHOA!  Oh, who am I kidding? I need to face the facts.  Face the facts that  the little guy!  And that Mr. Krabs is letting me go today.
Squidward:	  Krabs is letting you go today?  As in I won't have to work with you ever again. 
SpongeBob:	  Goodbye, Krusty Krab. Goodbye, life as I know it. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Yeah, as much as I don't like doing it, I have to let him go.  Gotten too big for his cage.  Go on, little guy. Fly away. You'll be missed.
Gary:	 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, what's the use, Gary?  I've lost the will to go on!   Hi, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob.  I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again.
SpongeBob:	  What happened to yours?
Patrick:	 Nothing, it's just empty.
SpongeBob:	  Oh, get it out of my sight! Now that I have no means of purchasing food for myself, I do not need a refrigerator.
Patrick:	 Oh, don't get down on yourself, buddy. You can still purchase food for me.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, no I can't, Patrick. I lost my job today. I won't be able to buy food for you, or Gary, or for anybody!
Patrick:	  Oh, no! What are you gonna do?!
SpongeBob:	  I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I've been a fry cook for so long I... I don't think I can do anything else.
Patrick:	  I know, SpongeBob! Just do what I do when  looking for a job.  Kick back, watch some T.V.,  and chug down a carton on Drinkable Sausage! 
Gary:	 
SpongeBob:	  Good, Gary! There had to be some job openings in the classifieds.  Whoa! Although, these ads smell a little out of date. I better get some fresh ones.  Lawyer, no. Too much arguing. Stunt driver, don't have a boating license. Astronaut, don't like food in a bag. Oh, this one sounds interesting. . That shouldn't be too much of a stretch from fry cooking.  20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97.  Order up!   What do you think, boss?
Carpenter:	  Clam shells! What have you done, boy? real I told you to build me a house, not a sandwich! 
SpongeBob:	 I guess I'm not a carpenter, Patrick.  I need to start fresh.  With a job that feels...natural. Something that says, "This is a job for a sponge." Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?
Patrick:	 No. Oh, but, yes! It's so obvious! You should work at the Krusty Krab. They need a fry cook!
SpongeBob:	 I can't, Patrick. That's the job I got fired from, remember?
Patrick:	 Ohhh. Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you. He looks happy.
SpongeBob:	 That's just a billboard, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Why don't you get a job as a billboard?
SpongeBob:	 I...don't think that's physically possible,  BUT I could audition to be a sponge model.
Patrick:	 Fine, do it your way.
SpongeBob:	 Wow! What a setup! Oh, I don't know, Patrick. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I don't have the talent.
Patrick:	 Oh, you have the talent. But do you have the natural ability?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, but...wait, isn't that the same thing?
Patrick:	 Why don't you find out?
SpongeBob:	  Wait! I can't do this, Patrick. What if I don't stack up to the competition? Maybe I should just beg Mr. Krabs for my old job back. 
Patrick:	 No way! It's too late for that now. Krabs doesn't need you anymore.  is your chance to prove you don't need him. Now get in there and earn me some groceries!   My friend here wants to audition for the sponge model role.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, well,  is a strong word. I'd like an audition, but if you've already cast it, that's fine if you cast it.  I think she's already cast it. We'd better go, Patrick.
Casting Director:	  Hold it. You want the audition, kid? You got it.
SpongeBob:	  I did?
Casting Director:	 Show me what you got.
SpongeBob:	  Okay. Here goes.  Patrick, please?  ♪  ♪  Sorry. 
Casting Director:	 Okay, okay, okay! Let's get on with this train wreck.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, getting on it.  ♪  ♪
Casting Director:	  All right, all right. Thank you. I've heard enough.
SpongeBob:	  How'd I do?
Casting Director:	 Horribly. I've seen clams with more talent than you.  But since the role specifically calls for a real sponge, the part is yours.  Here's the script. We start shooting tomorrow at 10. Don't be late. 
SpongeBob:	 I guess a sponge  make it in this town.  I am going to be a star! 
News Reporter:	 I'm standing here with the new face of television, Mr. SpongeBob SquarePants.  I'm sure the viewing audience would love to know, how does it feel to be the next big thing?
SpongeBob:	 Fantastic. 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob. Did you say something?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, yes I did, Patrick.  I said, "You're looking at the new face of television."
Patrick:	 All right!
SpongeBob:	 Well, I better go home and get some beauty sleep.
Patrick:	 Yeah, beauty sleep!
SpongeBob:	 That's right. You are looking at a changed sponge. But don't worry. I won't forget all the people who held me on the way up.
Mr. Krabs:	  Afternoon, boy-o!
SpongeBob:	 Ah, just as I was saying. I'd like to thank you for giving me my humble start. I won't forget you. 
Mr. Krabs:	  What was  about? Oh, probably just nonsense and babbling, as usual. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, when next you see me, it shall be on the television. 
Casting Director:	 Oh, you're back!
SpongeBob:	 A star's first day is his most important.
Casting Director:	 Great. Let me see if they're ready on set.  SpongeBob's here, sir. Uh-huh. Okay, great.  Okay, you can go right in.
SpongeBob:	 Yippee!  I am ready for my close-up, Mr. Director.
Director:	  Very well.  Lose the pants!  Hans! WHERE'S MY STAR?! 
SpongeBob:	 Whoa! What's happening?  Wh-wh-what's happening?!
Director:	 In this scene, you'll be cleaning bathroom mixtures.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, so, uh, where's my cleaning utensil?
Director:	  Don't you get it? You  the cleaning utensil.  Roll speed! 
Charlie:	  New Sponge Commercial: Take one. 
Director:	  Action!
Announcer:	  Oh, no! Your bathroom is a disaster. Get it cleaned up fast with...the new sponge! ] Household chores are a snap with new sponge. It cleans sinks.  Just look at that shine! New sponge cuts through even the toughest grime and grit. New sponge also cleans showers!  Ha, ha! That tile looks good as new!  But best of all, new sponge can make any toilet sparkle! 
SpongeBob:	 Nooo!  I can't do this!
Director:	  Cut!
SpongeBob:	  I'm sorry. I don't think I'm cut out for acting.
Director:	 ? You said you were professional actor.
SpongeBob:	 Well, I'm not.  I am a fry cook.  That's what I am, and that's what I've always been! I'm sorry to waste your time, mister. 
Director:	 Wait! WAIT!!
Mr. Krabs:	 Ever so gently...
SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs!  Please let me back, please! I promise I'll do better.  Please.
Mr. Krabs:	 Boy, what are you going on about?!
SpongeBob:	  I heard you on the phone saying you were gonna let the little guy go. But I don't wanna go! Please don't let me go, Mr. Krabs! You're looking at the little guy that doesn't want to go.
Mr. Krabs:	 All right, boy-o! I won't get rid of ya: on one condition. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, boy! This is the best job in the world!
Hans:	 Hey, could you keep it down in there?  I'm trying to concentrate!
