Plankton:	 Eh, that's the life.
Karen:	  Plankton!
Plankton:	 Hey, I was watching that!
Karen:	 And I'm tired of watching you sit around all day. Admit it, the Chum Bucket is a total failure.
Plankton:	 It is not! Business is just slow.
Karen:	 Nyah Nyah Nyah Nyah. If you'd take my advice, the Krabby Patty recipe would be yours.
Plankton:	 You? You're just a computer. I'm the evil genius around here.
Man:	  This is it, son, The Chum Bucket.
Plankton:	 Looks like this failure has a customer. Hello. Are you lost?
Man:	 No, we're not lost. I promised my boy I'd take him to the Chum Bucket today.
Plankton:	 Really?
Man:	 Wow, look at that order window! It's completely covered in grime and filth.
Kid:	 Cool.
Man:	  Smell that air!
Kid:	 It makes me want to hurl.
Man:	 I think the Chum Bucket is the high point of our tour.
Plankton:	 Your tour?
Man:	 That's right. We're visiting the most disgusting places in bikini bottom. And so far, you're number one. Farewell, you filthy little fella. 
Man:	 So What do ya say we try the city dump next?
Kid:	 Oh, boy.
Plankton:	 Groan.
Karen:	 So how'd it go?
Plankton:	 You're right. I'm such a failure.
Karen:	 So, do you give up?
Plankton:	 Yes.
Karen:	 You'll do what I tell you now?
Plankton:	 Yes.
Karen:	 Here's all you have to do. You want the patty recipe, then go to the man who wrote it, Eugene Krabs.
Plankton:	 Right. Why didn't I think of that before?
Karen:	 With my mind connector, you'll be able to read Krabs' mind, transferring the recipe directly into your teeny, tiny, little brain.
Plankton:	 Wow, that's a pretty good idea. Whoa! Um, Karen? Whoa!
Karen:	 Hold still.
Plankton:	 Mmph!
Karen:	 You'll need this. 
Plankton:	 And just how am I supposed to attach it to Krabs' brain?
Karen:	 Leave that to me, hon.
Karen:	 Prepare for launch. Target in range. Launch sequence initiated.
Plankton:	 No! Wait!
Plankton:	 There he is!  Get out of the way! This is it!  Move it! Ha, ha! You're mine!
SpongeBob:	 Hey, where do you want this life-size cutout of you, Mr. Krabs?
Plankton:	 No! 
Mr. Krabs:	  I told ya to stop playing with that thing and get back to work.
Plankton:	 Ugh. great.
Karen:	  Plankton, what happened?
Plankton:	 Thanks to your brilliant aim, honey, I'm stuck inside that fool of a fry cook.
Karen:	 Well,honey, you'll just have to change plans. Plug into his Eyes to See what's Going On Outside.
SpongeBob:	 Huh?  Hey, Squidward, we blew a fuse!
Squidward:	 I'm gonna blow a fuse if you don't get that order up.
Plankton:	  It worked! I can see everything SpongeBob sees.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, can somebody hit the lights?
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, where's the Krabby Patty for order 17?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Squidward, is that you? Oh, it's so dark in here. I can't see a thing.
Squidward:	 Can you just get the Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob:	 Sure thing Squidward. One Krabby Patty coming up!
Plankton:	 Oh Boy! He's gonna make a Krabby Patty in front Of my eyes!
SpongeBob:	  Oh, nuh-uh. Nuh, no. Ah, there you are, patty! Add one fluffy bun like so and a squirt of special sauce .
Plankton:	 Heh, heh, special sauce. Wait, soap is the special sauce?
SpongeBob:	 Then you grab yourself some lettuce.  And voil√†! One perfect Krabby Patty! Whoa. Watch your step, Squidward. It is pitch black out here.
Squidward:	 Don't know, don't want to.
SpongeBob:	 Order number 17. Order number 17? Order 17? Order 17.
Plankton:	 That's it! I'm going somewhere else. [plugs back SpongeBob's eye plugs] 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, the lights are back on.  Mr. Krabs! Help me, Mr. Krabs. I've forgotten how to make Krabby Patties. Please tell me the secret recipe again.
Mr. Krabs:	 Need a little refresher, eh? Okay, boy. I'll run through the Krabby Patty formula one more time.
Plankton:	 Let me see what I can tune in here. Hmm.
Mr. Krabs:	 The secret of the Krabby Patty formula. Jackpot!
Plankton:	 Huh?
SpongeBob:	 I said, could you speak a little louder, please?
Mr. Krabs:	 The secret to the Krabby Patty formula-
SpongeBob:	 What?
Mr. Krabs:	 Hold on.
Plankton:	 Here it comes.
Mr. Krabs:	  The secret to the Krabby Patty formula is...!
Plankton:	  Ow! I hate my life!
Mr. Krabs:	 Is this thing loud enough? Oh, sure, I can hear you fine now. What was the question again?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, it, uh-- you know, I don't remember. Me neither. So we good?
Mr Krabs:	 Yeah. Get out!
SpongeBob:	 Okay!
Plankton:	 Enough with these petty carnal senses. If I'm going to get the Krabby Patty recipe, the brain!  Honk!  Ugh!  Hi, friend.  Superficial Greetings? What kind of idiot--  Personal Opinions? Knock-knock Jokes? No, no, no, no! This is all useless! I'm gonna have to go in deeper.  Ugh.  Where am I?
Brain Gary:	 Meow, meow, meow! 
Plankton:	 Ew. That's disgusting. Now, where do morons keep all their secrets?  Nope.  Doesn't this kid have any secrets Aha!  The library, where he keeps records of his every thought. All of his deepest, juiciest secrets.   In convenient alphabetical order. Look at that. "Sounds that make Squidward upset"?
Plankton:	 "Patrick's favorite places to be scratched"?
Squidward:	 What are you doing? 
SpongeBob:	 Uh, uh, scratching!
Plankton:	 Aagh, all of these secrets are lame! Wait a minute. What's this?  The secret recipe isn't in the brain? It's located in the heart. How cheesy.  Ugh. Uh.  The Krabby Patty recipe. Yes, yes, yes! Here it is!  My mouth is watering.  My taste buds are tingling. Mm, mm. oh, yeah. It feels so good. I can feel it all the way to my finger....stumps. All of the ingredients coming together in perfect harmony. And it's all mine!  Hwuh. Okay, that was weird.

All of the delicious ingredients living in perfect harmony.
Karen:	 You got the recipe?
Plankton:	 I sure did.
Karen:	 Well, what are you waiting for? Bring it back to the Chum Bucket.
Plankton:	 Karen, wouldn't that be stealing?
Karen:	 What? Stealing?
Plankton:	 The Krabby Patty recipe is the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab.
Karen:	 Oh, brother. 
Patrick:	 Hey, everybody! Wait, that's not what I wanted to say. Now, what was it?
Patrick:	 Oh, well. Never mind. 
Karen:	 Well, where's the recipe?
Plankton:	 The What?
