Garbage Fish #1:	 Hmm... 
Garbage Fish #2:	 What is it?
Garbage Fish #1:	 I'd recognize this goo anywhere. It comes from a baby spotted glistening meadow worm, the rarest of its species.
Garbage Fish #2:	 Dude, those things are worth a fortune.
Mr. Krabs:	 Did you say "fortune?"   $5.99, that's right. Get them while they last. Don't be shy, folks.
Female fish:	 These things are so cute! 
SpongeBob:	 Enjoy your new home, little guy.
Female fish:	 Isn't he just adorable? 
SpongeBob:	 That sure was a great idea you had, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad.
