SpongeBob:	 Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy!  Wow! 
Sandy:	 Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?
SpongeBob:	 What is it?
Sandy:	 It's a rocket ship, duh! I'll meet you downstairs and show you around.
SpongeBob:	  Wow, what are you gonna do with it?
Sandy:	  I'm going to the moon, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 The moon! Can I go?
Sandy:	 No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird.  Besides, there's not enough room for you.
SpongeBob:	 But I don't take up that much space!  See?  I can fit in here.  Mmm, cozy.
Sandy:	 I need that drawer.
SpongeBob:	 Well, how about...  This?  Or this?  Or this?
Sandy:	 SpongeBob, this isn't for fun.  See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways. 
SpongeBob:	 Fine.  Put me in the brig, I don't mind!
Sandy:	 That's the air vent, SpongeBob.  I need that, too.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?
Sandy:	 All right. Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just...
SpongeBob:	  Yeah! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride! Moon ride! Moon ride!
Sandy:	  But this time, just don't touch anything, okay? 
SpongeBob:	 Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?
Sandy:	 Aww, hush, silly.  This is for harvesting moon rocks.
SpongeBob:	 Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.
Sandy:	 Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens.
SpongeBob:	 Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naive? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99Â¢ stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!
Sandy:	 SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave those crazy alien notions behind.
SpongeBob:	  Oh, hurry up!  These oughta do the trick.
Patrick:	  Hiya, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob:	 What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?
Patrick:	 Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something.
SpongeBob:	 A present?
Patrick:	 No. Uhh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?
SpongeBob:	 There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.
Patrick:	  Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!
SpongeBob:	 Alien repellent? Let me see that.  New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows! 
Patrick:	 Look how big it is, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 It's pretty impressive, all right.
Patrick:	 Come on! 
SpongeBob:	 We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
Patrick:	 Wow. How do you think we get inside? 
SpongeBob:	 We don't, we're just spraying the...  ...windows.
Patrick:	 I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on!  Holy seacow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, Just don't touch anything. 
Patrick:	 Look, I'm winning!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun...  ...house?
Patrick:	 Woo-hoo! Winner! Yeah! High score!
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?
Patrick:	 I don't know!  But let's see what this does!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, I don't think we should... 
Patrick:	 I like rockets. 
Patrick:	 More! More!
SpongeBob:	 No more!  Okay, one more.  Okay, that's enough. Let's go.
Patrick:	 Oh, wait, I think this one starts it. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here. 
Patrick:	 We've started the rocket!
Sandy:	  Oh, SpongeBob... 
Patrick:	 Hold on, buddy!  Hey, we stopped falling!
SpongeBob:	 Look!  We're in space now! Whee! 
Patrick:	 Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something!  Hey, SpongeBob, watch this! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter!  Patrick, I can do this! 
Patrick:	 Hey, who turned the heavy back on?
SpongeBob:	 We must be landing.
Patrick:	 All right! 
Sandy:	 Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts. 
Patrick:	 Wow, it sure looks a lot like home.  Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!
SpongeBob:	 Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.
Patrick:	 So you mean to say they've taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think...
SpongeBob:	 Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!
Patrick:	 You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.
SpongeBob:	 Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me!  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier! 
Patrick:	 Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
SpongeBob:	 Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uhh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to.  Make sure your gun is pumped.  Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting.  It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis. 
Patrick:	 Wait, what's that?  I think I'm gonna be sick.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
Patrick:	 Stinky.
SpongeBob:	 No, it's an egg sac! Let's look at the embryo. 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Twins. 
Patrick:	 Pardon my French but get this thing off me! 
Squidward:	 Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
Patrick:	 It's awake!
SpongeBob:	 Let's capture the little phony! 
Squidward:	 Get away from me! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye?  Wait! Don't shoot. Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!
SpongeBob:	 We don't want your money, moon man!  Look at them squirming around in there.
Patrick:	 Eww, gross.
SpongeBob:	 Well, there's plenty more where those came from. 
Mrs. Puff:	  SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late?  Whatever this is...  ...it's going on your permanent record! 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.
SpongeBob:	 There's no time for that! Just push harder. 
Sandy:	 SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of... 
SpongeBob:	 Nice try, Sandy.
Patrick:	 Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants. 
Sandy:	 Aliens? Is that what this is about?  This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot-- 
SpongeBob:	 It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone.  So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!
Patrick:	 I didn't even know!
SpongeBob:	 Yeah? Well, I got you now.
Patrick:	 Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's...  ...me that's got me!
SpongeBob:	 Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this!  Sandy, I'm back!  Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different.  Uh-oh...
Everyone else:	 SpongeBob, we "aliens" would like a word with you!
