Chorus:	 If you're in a jam, It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
Fish Head:	 The Adventures of Mermaid Man And Barnacle Boy! Tonight's episode: The Secret Meeting!  Deep in the Mercave, something strange takes Mermaid Man's attention!
Barnacle Boy:	 The Dirty Bubble? What's he doing at the bus stop?
Mermaid Man:	 Looks like he's got a one-way ticket to Bikini Bottom, and there's only one thing he could be up to in Bikini Bottom, Barnacle Boy!
Barnacle Boy:	 That's right, Mermaid Man!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy:	 Evil!
Dirty Bubble:	 Haherhaherherherher!
Fish Head:	 The Terrible Man Ray!
Dirty Bubble:	 Hm, so glad you could make it!
Man Ray:	 I wouldn't miss this for the world, Dirty! Hahahahah.
Fish Head:	 The most Powerful Of All crustaceans, it's Jumbo Shrimp! Its the Atomic Flounder! The abomination of a nuclear experiment gone horribly wrong! And the terror of the sewers, the man eating Sinister Slug!
Dirty Bubble:	 We join Forces at last.
Mermaid Man:	 It's worse than i could have imagined! A team up!
Dirty Bubble:	 Welcome to the BGATFBC! 
Everyone:	 Muhahahahahahahha! 
Mermaid Man:	 April third, 12 of noon! That's tomorrow!
Barnacle Boy:	 Holy... 
Patrick:	 Hey!
SpongeBob:	 Hehehe! Don't worry! I can fix it!  Deeae! 
Barnacle Boy:	 Great Guppies, Mermaid Man! We gotta do something!
Mermaid Man:	 Not so fast, little flipper! We are far too out-manned! But fear not. We are always one step ahead of evil!
Fish Head:	 Our Hero of the bride puts up a call!
Mermaid Man:	 To the ocean's greatest heroes!
Lady:	 
Mermaid Man:	 Yeah, I can hold.
Fish Head:	 Meanwhile, a sinister horde congregates outside Hotel Evil!
Dirty Bubble:	 Right this way, gentlemen! 
Jumbo Shrimp:	 Hey, what's going on in here?
Dirty Bubble:	 Huh? Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry, gentlemen, you must be in the wrong room! This room is reserved for the B.G.A.T.F.B.C.
Mermaid Man:	  That's funny. I thought it was aside for the I.J.L.S.A.
Dirty Bubble:	 I.J.L.S.A? What in coral caverns is that?
All Bad Guys:	 Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
Mermaid Man:	 That's right!  Now, before you have to say goodbye, say hello to some friends!  The Elastic Wasteband!
Barnacle Boy:	 Greet the hottest crime fighter in the country!  Professor Magma!
Professor Magma:	 
Mermaid Man:	 The illusive Miss Appear!  And The Pi-Right Ponderer with his hairnet of knowledge!
Pi-Right Ponderer:	 Do we really exist?
Mermaid Man:	 Together, we are The International Justice League Of Super Acquaintances!
Dirty Bubble:	 Let's Get em boys! 
Jumbo Shrimp:	 Do not tussle with the B.G.A.T.F.B.C! 
Pi-Right Ponderer:	 Violence resolves nothing.
Man Ray:	  Good night, balloon boy! 
Miss Appear:	 Professor Magma! Catch! 
Barnacle Boy:	 Step aside, you copious cod! My beef is with the bubble!
Mermaid Man:	 Careful Barnacle Boy! He's got Nuclear Touch!
Atomic Flounder:	 RAAAA! 
Barnacle Boy:	 Nuclear Touch!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Aaahh!
Patrick:	 I Can't watch! 
Mermaid Man:	 Fracturing furniture! Hang tight buddy! 
Mermaid Man:	 Hang in there, my daring deputy. 
FaceHand:	 Your daring deputy is nothing right now! But I'd be happy to pass along out the message! If he ever wakes up that is!
Mermaid Man:	 Swirling Shrimp! That fiend has taken control over Barnacle Boy!
Elastic Waistband:	 What do we do, Mermaid Man?
Mermaid Man:	 I'm glad you asked!  I believe that if The Atomic Flounder were to touch that wretched growth, it would cause a chain reaction, reversing the polarity, and the molecular level, restoring Barnacle Boy to his natural state!!
Handface:	 You'll never do it! You don't have the moxie!
Mermaid Man:	 That's what you think, curd!  Shield!  Ha, Ha, Ha! 
SpongeBob:	 Look out, Mermaid Man!
Mermaid Man:	 
Sinister Slug:	 Grrrr! 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Yay!
Mermaid Man:	 The Sinister Slug's slime has got you stationary and stiff! Which means, your time is up, Hand!
HandFace:	 Not Nuclear Touch! 
Barnacle Boy:	 Great Gravy! What just happened?
Mermaid Man:	 I'll tell you about it later, now let's take out the trash!
Pi-Right Ponderer:	 Please, you can use my hairnet of knowledge.
Mermaid Man:	 Thank You Ponderer.
Dirty Bubble:	 No! No! You Guys don't understand! It's not what you think! 
Mermaid Man:	 You really thought you were going to get away from it, did you? First up, villains, what does BGATFBC?
Man Ray:	 It stands for the Bad Guys All Together For Book Club!
Mermaid Man:	 Book Club? You mean you weren't going to destroy a library or something?
Man Ray:	 Why would we do that? We're almost to the new chapter!
Atomic Flounder:	 What are you going to do, lock us up for reading?
Jumbo Shrimp:	 Yeah! You can't prison us for reading!
Mermaid Man:	 That's right. Remember kids, no one can imprison you for reading!
Patrick:	 Hey, what happened? Why are those squiggles on the screen?
SpongeBob:	 Those are called "End Credits," Patrick.
Patrick:	 End credits? But I don't want it to end!
SpongeBob:	 That's why Neptune gave us the rewind button! 
Patrick:	 Thank you Neptune!
