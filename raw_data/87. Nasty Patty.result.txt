Narrator:	  Oh, a dark and stormy night. It's nights like these that remind me of the time Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob thought they killed the health inspector.  It was a bright and sunny morning. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Ah...That smells like...  ...the health inspector!  Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here!  If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob:	 But Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry.  The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.
Mr. Krabs:	 You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son?  Just go out there and give him what he needs. Pour on the charm. Sweet talk him. 
SpongeBob:	 What can I get for you...handsome?
Mr. Krabs:	  We're doomed.
Health Inspector:	 I'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu.
SpongeBob:	  Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up!  He wants one of everything.
Mr. Krabs:	 Then we'll give him a smorgasbord!  The future of the Krusty Krab is at stake! 
SpongeBob:	 Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir! 
Mr. Krabs:	 The Buttered Barnacles are a touch of heaven. 
SpongeBob:	 The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Fresh Sludge Pudding? 
SpongeBob:	 More Diet Red Tide? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Some Fried Flotsam? 
Health Inspector:	 Please, gentlemen!  Leave me to finish my work in peace. 
SpongeBob:	 And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?
Health Inspector:	  So far, so good. I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.
SpongeBob:	  He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!
Mr. Krabs:	  Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear! 
A. Realistic Fish Head:	 We interrupt this can-can for a special news bulletin. Be on the lookout for a man who's been passing himself off as a health inspector in order to obtain free food. That's all for now. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Free food?!
SpongeBob:	 Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.
Mr. Krabs:	 You loony loofah, he is the impostor! We've been duped!
SpongeBob:	 Duped!
Mr. Krabs:	 Bamboozled!
SpongeBob:	 We've been smeckledorfed!
Mr. Krabs:	 That's not even a word, and I agree with ya!  Look at him. I bet he never changes his underwear.
SpongeBob:	 I bet he bites whale bubbles.
Mr. Krabs:	 I bet his mom bought him that hat.  If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one.  You're dancin' with the crab man now! Join me, boy, or you're fired!
SpongeBob:	 It doesn't seem right...  ...but it feels so good!  Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ohh, hold on, I've got a ton of toenail clippings in my office! 
SpongeBob:	 Oops, I dropped it in the toilet! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, fish it out, and I'll dry it with me gym socks!  Why that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned! 
SpongeBob:	 I call it the 'Nasty Patty'. 
Health Inspector:	 Hey, hurry up with that patty! 
SpongeBob:	  Here you go sir, enjoy. 
Health Inspector:	 Ah, hello, delicious. Come to papa. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Listen, he ate it!  Oh, look at him choke!  Look at him suffer!  Did you see that, boy? Oh man, the look on his face. 
A. Realistic Fish Head:	 We interrupt your laughter at other people's expense to bring you this news flash. The fake inspector has been captured. Here is his picture.  If a health inspector comes to your restaurant and he's not this guy, he's real.
SpongeBob:	 Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.
Mr. Krabs:	  I don't think he'll be laughin', boy.
SpongeBob:	 Why, sir?
Mr. Krabs:	 Because that patty killed him! 
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?
Mr. Krabs:	 What's this "we" stuff? You fed him the tainted patty. Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!
SpongeBob:	 But you told me to give it to him!
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, you could've talked me out of it!
SpongeBob:	 You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Get a hold of yourself, boy. We've got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it. We've got to take it out and bury it. 
Spongebob:	  Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpsy! 
Mr. Krabs:	 This should be far enough. Now get diggin'! 
SpongeBob:	 Yes, sir. 
Mr. Krabs:	 What's the holdup down there?
SpongeBob:	 There's a big rock in the way!
Mr. Krabs:	 Well toss it out and get back to diggin'!
SpongeBob:	  Aye aye, sir! 
Health Inspector:	 Uhh, where am I? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Somethin' ain't quite right.
SpongeBob:	 What do you mean, Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs:	 His head's stickin' out! 
SpongeBob:	 Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought he might need some air.
Mr. Krabs:	 They don't need air where he's going.
SpongeBob:	 Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?
Mr. Krabs:	 Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uhh...
SpongeBob:	  What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that! Why? Why? Why?! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Listen here, ya little barnacle. No one, and I mean no one, can ever know about this. It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me, and worst of all, it'll be the end of me.
Officer Malley:	  Stop right where you are! I'm afraid we're going to have to arrest the two of you! 
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail! 
Mr. Krabs:	 And what would be the charges?
Officer Malley:	 For not being at the Krusty Krab to whip us up a couple of dee-licious Krabby Patties! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Laugh, boy. 
Officer Nancy:	 Put that muddy shovel in the trunk and we'll give you a ride back. 
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, listen carefully. We're just getting a lift back to the Krusty Krab. I need you to stay calm and don't lose your cool. Understand. 
SpongeBob:	 Can I lose my cool now?
Mr. Krabs:	 Why?  Put it in the trunk, boy! I'll keep them cops busy!
Officer Malley:	 What's the holdup back there? 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Neptune, get away!  Ahem. Ok, all set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk. 
Mr. Krabs:	 All set! 
Officer Nancy:	 You ok there, little fella?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, he gets carsick real easy.
Officer Malley:	 Well buckle up and we'll drive real smooth-like. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab, I want you to take that  shovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff...err, I mean, stow it in the freezer. Understand?
SpongeBob:	 I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo...
Mr. Krabs:	  ...ttles of soda! Bottles of soda, Same thing, put 'em in the freezer. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh man, this is so gross!  The back door is locked. What am I gonna do? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Ahoy there, SpongeBob! I thought you were out back taking care of that shovel! 
SpongeBob:	 Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here.  So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go put my hat in the freezer now. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Okey dokey, SpongeBob!
Officer Malley:	 Is that boy ok?
Officer Nancy:	 He's acting a little funny.
Mr. Krabs:	 Funny? Oh, yeah!  He's a real cutup, that one. He knows how to keep the growing stages! Good one, boy! Always on, that one, there's no off on his funny switch!  Oh, look, I almost forgot, it's 'Open Cash Register' night! First two customers get all the money in the cash register! 
Policeman:	  Eighty-six those patties, Krabs. We just got a call about two ghouls burying a stiff over by Shallow Grave Road.
Officer Nancy:	 I want a soda. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Here's your soda! Always a pleasure to serve the folks in blue. Well, goodbye now!
Officer Nancy:	 Hey, there's no ice!
Mr. Krabs:	  Ice? Ice? You want ice? Is that what you want? You want ice? Is that what you want? 
SpongeBob:	 The dark deed you requested is done, sir.
Officer Nancy:	  I'll get it myself. Ice is in the freezer, right? 
Mr. Krabs:	 There is no ice! There's never been any ice. Ice is just a myth.
Officer Nancy:	 Step aside. You people act like you've committed a murder.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ok, I confess!  SpongeBob killed him!
SpongeBob:	 What? You can't pin this whole rap on me!
Mr. Krabs:	 He was insane! Out of control! He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along.
SpongeBob:	 It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.
Mr. Krabs:	 Put him down now! He's a mad dog!
SpongeBob:	 He wears curlers to bed!
Mr. Krabs:	 Wait! It's not what you think!
Officer Nancy:	 What are you two talking about?
Mr. Krabs:	 We killed the health inspector! Buried him and then stuffed his body in the freezer!
Officer Nancy:	 You mean in here? 
Mr. Krabs:	 It's empty?
Officer Nancy:	 Is this some kind of a joke?
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah...a joke! 
Officer Nancy:	 Say, maybe he turned into a zombie and walked out. 
SpongeBob:	  It's the zombie! 
Health Inspector:	 Hey, you guys...
Officer Malley:	  Take that, you zombie! 
Officer Nancy:	 I'll take it from here.  Die, zombie!
Officer Malley:	 Good police work, officer Nancy. Hey, this guy's not a zombie. He's just an ordinary health inspector.
Health Inspector:	 Yes. And at the risk of being hit again, I'd like to present you with this. 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!
Everyone:	 Hooray! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price! Well, not really.
Health Inspector:	  Oh boy, I'd like a Krabby Patt... 
Narrator:	 Well, that's the story. Yes, they are all idiots, aren't they?
