Plankton:	 My Evil Genius Video Diary by Sheldon J. Plankton.  Greetings. It is I, Plankton!  I'm sorry. I'm not myself today.  It's just the world knows me as an evil villain...
Dead Eye Plankton:	 That's me, Dead Eye Plankton.
Plankton:	 ...bent on destroying The Krusty Krab and stealing the Krabby Patty formula...  I've got your formula.  Yeeha!  ...but I'm so much more than that. Does anyone care about my hopes? My dreams? My secret passion for song?  That's right. I may have a mind of an evil genius, but I also have the voice of an angel.   Me. Me. Me.  Me.
Bill:	 Did you hear that?
Nazz-Mimi:	 How could I not?
Plankton:	 Can your normal super villain do that? I don't think so!  Alas, the world is not ready for a talent like mine, but I'll get there some day.  You better watch your back, Justin Bottomfeeder.   "N" is for anywhere at anytime at all down here in the deep blue sea.  That's the stuff.
