SpongeBob:	 Oh, Squidward!
Squidward:	  What do you want, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Time for work, Squidward. Another day, another dollar. 
Squidward:	 More like another nickel.
SpongeBob:	  Good one, Squidward!  Another day, another nickel. 
Squidward:	 It's not that funny.
SpongeBob:	 It's funny, because it's true! 
Squidward:	 Move over. 
SpongeBob:	  Nickel. 
Squidward:	  Here's your food.  It's not that funny!  Please make it stop! 
SpongeBob:	 Ok, Squidward, see ya tomorrow. 
Customer #1:	 And always check for spare change.
SpongeBob:	 Another day, another...nickel!  2 Krabby Patties.
Customer #2:	 Thanks, kid.
SpongeBob:	 Another day, another nickel.
Customer #2:	 Oh. 
Squidward:	 He's gone laughing tormentor.  This could be my chance.  SpongeBob, you don't look well!
SpongeBob:	 I don't?
Squidward:	 No. You should sit down.
SpongeBob:	 But...
Squidward:	  Shh, shh, shh.  You're burning up, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 I am?
Squidward:	 Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, a little.
Squidward:	 And your temperature is 175 degrees!
SpongeBob:	 It's that bad?
Squidward:	 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing.
SpongeBob:	 I have been laughing a lot, lately.
Squidward:	  SpongeBob, you've got to be careful! You're gonna burn out your laugh box.
SpongeBob:	 My laugh box?
Squidward:	 Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter. If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again.
SpongeBob:	 Is that what happened to you, Squidward?
Squidward:	 Yes. What? No! Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious. If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again. 
Sandy:	 Hey, Patrick, you wanna hear a joke?
Patrick:	 Sure, Sandy.
SpongeBob:	  Sure, I'd love a good laugh.
Sandy:	 What has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck! 
SpongeBob:	 I don't wanna burn out my laugh box, Squidward.
Squidward:	 Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing. Any laugh at all could be dangerous.
SpongeBob:	 How long do I have to avoid laughing?
Squidward:	 Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day. But you better go 24 hours just to be safe.
SpongeBob:	 Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you!  A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant.  Nothing funny over there.  Nothing funny over here.
Patrick:	 Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, banana peel, don't!
Patrick:	 What'd you say? 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, no. 
Patrick:	 Hey, what the... 
SpongeBob:	 Wait a minute, Patrick!  Please stop!
Patrick:	 Right foot first...
SpongeBob:	 Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh.
Patrick:	 You can't? Oh, I know what to do!  That usually knocks him out. 
SpongeBob:	  Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control.  Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob.  They're everywhere. Everywhere!
Delivery Fish:	 Look out for that pie truck! 
SpongeBob:	 I gotta get outta here.  There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe...  Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing.  That's odd.  I've lost my laugh.  I've lost my laugh! 
Patrick:	 Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore!
Patrick:	 What happened?
SpongeBob:	 I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone.
Patrick:	 Let me take a look.  Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Come in.
SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob:	 I lost my laugh.
Mr. Krabs:	 You've come to the right place, son. Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh.  Don't it just tickle you, boy?
SpongeBob:	 Not really.
Mr. Krabs:	 This calls for drastic measures. I don't usually do this but you seem desperate. touch it.
SpongeBob:	  Nothing.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, this is worse than I thought. After all, money is the ultimate source of joy.
SpongeBob:	 Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist. 
Sandy:	 Oh, it's easy if you approach it scientifically, SpongeBob. Now, what is laughter?
SpongeBob:	 The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose but now mocks me with its cruel indifference.
Sandy:	  But scientifically speaking, its caused by your epiglottis constricting your larynx causing irregular air intake and respiratory upset.
SpongeBob:	 Sounds painful.
Sandy:	 Science makes everything sound painful, SpongeBob.  Now, here's a humor theory textbook, laugh mechanics, and the quantum giggle theory.
SpongeBob:	 Thank you, Sandy.
Squidward:	 Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack.
SpongeBob:	 I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again. 
Squidward:	 I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy. 
Narrator:	 Later that same evening.
Squidward:	  I think I found the one thing I hate more than his laugh. I'm sure he'll cry himself out soon.  What have I done?  Oh, that's it! This charade has to end. 
SpongeBob:	 Hi Squidward.
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop.
SpongeBob:	 But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box! 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box! I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!
SpongeBob:	 You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression.
Squidward:	 Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes.
SpongeBob:	 I could laugh the whole time?
Squidward:	 Yeah.  You really fell for it.
SpongeBob:	 I guess I did.
Squidward:	 You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine. 
SpongeBob:	  It's really not that funny, Squidward.
Squidward:	 It's hilarious!
SpongeBob:	 See ya later, Squidward. 
Squidward:	  Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel. I will yahhhh! 
Patrick:	 Look, he's waking up.
Squidward:	 Where am I?
Sandy:	 You're in the hospital, silly. You broke your laugh box.
Mr. Krabs:	 The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on.
Patrick:	 So they cut it out.
Squidward:	 Cut it out?
Patrick:	 Yeah, wanna see it?  It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around.
Squidward:	  Gimme that. I can never laugh again?
Doctor:	 Nonsense. Your laugh should be stronger than ever.
Squidward:	 But, you cut out my laugh box.
Doctor:	 Yes, but uhh, one of your friends generously allowed us to transplant part of theirs to you.
Patrick:	 Nope.
Mr. Krabs:	 They wouldn't pay me.
Sandy:	 You're getting warmer.
Squidward:	  SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, you laugh just like me.  Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world.
