SpongeBob:	 Gary! What are you doing!?
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Oh my gosh! Your bowl is empty! Not to worry, Gare-gare! Food is on the way, faster than you can say  organic!
Gary:	 Meow? 
SpongeBob:	 There you go, Gary!  Gary! Shame on you! I realize you're a bottom feeder, but have some manners! You know you're not supposed to eat goop off the ground! Now go on and enjoy your health food!
Gary:	  Meow, meow, meow… 
SpongeBob:	 What is this stuff, anyway? It doesn't seem to be coming off!  Ooh! Company! 
Patrick:	 Hi, SpongeBob! Eww!!! 
SpongeBob:	 Is something wrong, Patrick?
Patrick:	 SpongeBob! What is that?
SpongeBob:	 What's what?
Patrick:	 This! 
SpongeBob:	 Ow!!! P-P-P-Patrick, what should I do?
Patrick:	 Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!
SpongeBob:	 Good idea! 
Patrick:	 Uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah?
Patrick:	 I don't know about this!
SpongeBob:	 What makes you say that?
Patrick:	 This.
SpongeBob:	  Ay-yi-yi! It's getting bigger!  Nothing a little pimple cream can't cure!  That's more like it! All better. See, Patrick?
Patrick:	 Sure do! Well, I gotta go sit in my hole. Catch ya later, pal.
SpongeBob:	 Bye, Patrick!  Ahh… This feels better!  Let's see. A four-letter word, ooh. Meaning of uncomfortable sensation on the dermis… Hmm…  ITCH!!!  Don't worry, SpongeBob. Everyone gets itchy, swelling skin rash now and then. Just don't scratch it and it'll go away… Eventually.  There! Outta sight, outta mind! Huh?  I won't let this minor setback hinder my fry cooking!  Now nothing can distract me from frying up those patties… Except maybe this unbearable itchiness! Must… Stop… SCRATCHING!!!! 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Huh? Oh, hi, Squidward!
Squidward:	 SpongeBob? Why are you all puffy?
SpongeBob:	 All what-y?
Squidward:	 Your skin, SpongeBob! What's wrong with your skin?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, that! It's nothing really, Squidward… Just a little blemish, that's all! 
Squidward:	 That's no blemish!
SpongeBob:	 Help… Me!!!
Squidward:	 Oh, I'll help you, alright! 
S.W.A.T. Fish #1:	 S.W.A.T. Team.  We'll be right over! 
S.W.A.T. Fish #2:	 Hold it right there! Neptune's trident! This is the most severe case of Ick yet. 
S.W.A.T. Fish #3:	 Stop, you fool!  Do you wanna get infected? This is a job for the hazmat physician.
Hazmat Physician:	 Get back! I said, get back! Back I say! 
SpongeBob:	 What's going on, Squidward? Help!! 
Squidward:	  Here's your change, sir. 
Old Man Jenkins:	 Oh, why thank you very much, young man.
Squidward:	 What was that? No, no Mr. Squidward! That can't be the Ick. 
SpongeBob:	 Where am I? Whoa!  Who are you people? I wanna go home! 
Scientist:	 You are home, SpongeBob. You just have to stay in this bubble until the Ick clears up.
SpongeBob:	 Where's my snail, Gary?
Scientist:	 We're taking care of your pet. 
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Gary? Whoa! 
Hazmat Physician:	 He appears stable, sir.
Scientist:	 Alright, boys, let's pack it up.
Patrick:	 Wow!  Huh? What is this? 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick! Stop! Stop! You're gonna pop it!
Patrick:	 Really? How about if I squeeze it like this?  Or this?  Or this? 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Patrick!!! How many times do I have to tell you? Be careful!!!
Patrick:	 Sorry. Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?
SpongeBob:	 Sure! Let's begin!  Um... Patrick?
Patrick:	 I win! I win! I win!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick?
Patrick:	  Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!
SpongeBob:	 PATRICK!!! What am I gonna do? My bubble is destroyed.
Patrick:	 I've got an idea! 
SpongeBob:	 There is no time for games, Pat! Now think, SpongeBob! The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands!  Patrick, you're a genius! And this one's mobile!  Now I can go back to work! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Squidward! Help!  Help me flip these patties! We've got growling stomachs out there!
Squidward:	  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Mr. Krabs:	 Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers? Oh… If only SpongeBob were here…
Squidward:	 If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in the Ick!  Lunch is served!  Eat up, kids. 
Nathiel Waters:	  Ahh.
Squidward:	  Oh, why am I so itchy?  Oh no.  SpongeBob gave me the Ick! And I gave it to all you people!!!  Stay back, you diseased freaks!
Mr. Krabs:	  What's all the commotion about?
Unknown Fish:	  The commotion, my dear Krabs, is regarding the hygiene standards of your eating establishment, which would appear to be inadequate.
Mr. Krabs:	 Inadequate!?! I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free. 
SpongeBob:	 Sorry I'm late, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob SquarePants, returning for duty, sir.
Unknown Fish:	 Is that what you consider clean and disease-free, Krabby? I say we ramshack this greasy disease shack! Who's with me?
All:	 We are!
Mr. Krabs:	 It wasn't me! It was Squidward! He gave you all the Ick!
Squidward:	 No! No I didn't! It was SpongeBob! He's infected the entire Krusty Krab!!! 
Unknown Fish:	 Let us apprehend that careless contaminator!!! 
Gary:	 Meow. 
SpongeBob:	  Ohhhh, noo!  Stop! You're pushing out more of the Ick!!! [the unknown fish the other fish make a final body slam] NOOOOO!!!!! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!
Squidward:	 It's not me, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob:	 Gary the Snail! Don't you know it's impolite to feed off of other people without permission? 
Mr. Krabs:	 He's just doing his job, SpongeBob! He's a bottomfeeder, remember? See? The little feller licked me clean! I'm cured! And he'll clean the Ick off any surface! Even Squid! 
Nat Peterson:	 Whoa! Me next!
Martha Smith:	 Where are your manners? It's ladies first!
Patrick:	 I believe the expression is starfish first.
Unknown Fish:	 I supersede all of you! For I have an exotic accent.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, hey, hey! There's no need to fight! Cause I have a solution I'll be happy with.  Step up to be de-Icked! Only 5 dollars! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Now can I get you a Krabby Patty? 
Unknown Fish:	 In the light of today's events, that notion is crass and offensive.  I'll take two, please.
Mr. Krabs:	 Alright! 
SpongeBob:	 Here you go, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 Another 5 dollars for another de-Icking. 
SpongeBob:	 Look, Gary! You made me all sparkly! You're the best bottom feeder a sponge could ever have!
Mr. Krabs:	 Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too. Now, back to work!
