SpongeBob:	  Going to work, going to work, I'm going to work! I'm going to work, I'm going to work  I'm going to work!  I'm going to work. I'm going to work, going to work, go-going to work. I'm crossing the street!  I'm crossing the street! Cross- whup!Â  I'd recognize that sound anywhere! It's the sound of horrible, croaking sobbing!
