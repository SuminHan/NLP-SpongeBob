French Narrator:	 Ahh, another beautiful day in Bikini Bottom's own Jellyfish Fields. An untamed world of natural order where the little jellyfish jellies roam free across the salty seascape. And where there is jellyfish, there is the Jellyfish Hunter.
SpongeBob:	 La la la la, la la la la la!  You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you "Twelvey."  Coochie coochie coo!  Bye, Twelvey!  Oh! It's you!  Well it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name.
No Name:	  
SpongeBob:	  Gotcha!  Barnacles! How'd he do that? Someday I'll catch old No Name.
SpongeBob:	 I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 You've got 5 minutes!
SpongeBob:	 Wow! One more minute than yesterday! SpongeBob ready for lunch!   Yum!
Fred:	  Hey, buddy! What the heck is that?
SpongeBob:	 Why, this is a hole, sir. You see, I am a sponge, and...
Fred:	 No, not that!  That!
SpongeBob:	 It's just a little ol' Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly! I call it a Krabby Patty with Jellyfish Jelly.
Fred:	 Could I try some?
SpongeBob:	 Sure! 
Fred:	  Amazing! I've got to tell someone about this. ♪Hey all you people! Hey all you people! Hey all you people, won't you listen to me? I just had a sandwich, no ordinary sandwich, a sandwich filled with jellyfish jelly! Hey, man, you've got to try this sandwich! It's no ordinary sandwich! It's the tastiest sandwich in the sea!  Yeah... Thank you!♪
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, who's playing Squidward's records again?
SpongeBob:	 No-one Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers.  Here you go Mr. Krabs. Send your taste buds on a journey.
Mr. Krabs:	  Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!
Fred:	 Sir, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten! I'm going to come back here for lunch everyday for the rest of my life!  Hey, buddy, you alright?
Mr. Krabs:	 
SpongeBob:	 You okay Mr. K?
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, I got a proposition for ye. How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?
SpongeBob:	 Oh boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, keep dreaming.  This'll be on your time.
SpongeBob:	 Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Krabs:	 Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it  ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish.
SpongeBob:	 But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers.  Oh no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!
SpongeBob:	  No! Never!
Mr. Krabs:	  Then go out there and get me some more jellies!
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Mr. Krabs. Just make sure the jellyfish are comfortable. They are oh, so sensitive. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh, I'll keep 'em comfortable all right, inside me wallet! 
SpongeBob:	  Here you go, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	  I'm gonna need more than that, boy.
SpongeBob:	  More jellies, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh, that'll never do. More!
Mr. Krabs:	  More, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs:	 What don't you understand about... more!
Mr. Krabs:	 More!  More!  More!  More!  More...  More!  More, more, more, more! More, more! More! 
SpongeBob:	 Well, there's no more! Now, that's jellyfishing!
SpongeBob:	 It feels like somebody... wants to sell me something!
Businessman:	  I told you he was onto us!
SpongeBob:	  I'm not interested in anything you're selling!  I sure felt like...  I must be working too hard.  I'll get it, Gary! Hello, SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob speaking. Hello?
No Name:	 
SpongeBob:	  Wrong number.  I guess Gary forgot to pay the electric bill!  Gary, is that you? Gary?  Uh, yeah, good idea, Gary, there's probably some candles in the kitchen.  Hello, what's this? What are you doing here, oh delicious one? A little snack will calm my nerves! Mmm... a Krabby Patty with blue jelly.  Blue jelly!  Hey, old No Name? What's happening?
No Name:	 
SpongeBob:	 No Name, let me out! What are you gonna do with me? Pee-yew! What smells like big business?  Hey, I don't remember that factory!  Huh?  What is this horrible place? 
Robot:	 Coochie coochie coo. 
SpongeBob:	 What kind of monster is responsible for this horror?
Mr. Krabs:	  That's it, boys! Keep that gelatinous gold mine flowing! 
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs? No! Now I know why you brought me here. But what can we do?  Mr. Krabs! Stop this madness! Stop it right now!
Mr. Krabs:	 Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, boy! A tea party!  You tricked me, Mr. Krabs! I wouldn't have collected all those jellyfish if I knew that this was their fate! This isn't right! Jellyfish need wide-open space and fresh air!
Mr. Krabs:	 Easy boy, what are you doing with that?
SpongeBob:	   Something that should've been done a long time ago!
Mr. Krabs:	 No!
SpongeBob:	 The squeaky bolt on this door was driving me crazy!
Mr. Krabs:	  Whew!
SpongeBob:	 And now I'm gonna set these jellyfish free! 
Mr. Krabs:	  Well, you can't. The door's voice-activated and will only open if I say "open". 
SpongeBob:	 Freedom! Freedom!
Mr. Krabs:	 You'll never catch me!  Blasted exercise craze! 
SpongeBob:	  Goodbye, friends!
Mr. Krabs:	  I'm taking jelly off the menu. 
SpongeBob:	 He really got burned on that deal!  All is as it should be.  I promise never to use this jellyfish net for anything but pure sport again. Jellyfish aren't meant to be captured forever!  Oh, No Name! I guess I can name you now. I'll call you... "Friend."
