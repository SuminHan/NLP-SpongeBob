Squidward:	 Oh, why can't I get to sleep? Let's try it again.  Warm milk.  White noise machine.
Squidward:	 Dim lights.  ♪Sleep, little Squidward, catch some winks everything and everybody clearly stinks♪
SpongeBob:	 Oh, yeah! Fizz Bomb Cola!
Patrick:	 Fire in the hole!
Squidward:	  Hey! Will you two psychopaths keep it down?!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, hi, Squidward? How ya doing?
Squidward:	 Horrible! I haven't slept for three days!
Patrick:	  Hey, that's great!
Squidward:	 It is not great!  I've got an audition with the Bikini Bottom Philharmonic Orchestra tomorrow morning, and I'm a nervous wreck!
SpongeBob:	  Why don't you try taking a walk? Works for me.
Squidward:	 You know, normally, I jump up and scream when you appear like that. But I'm so tired, I'm just gonna take your stupid advice.
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick, no!
SpongeBob:	 We've got to keep it quiet.
Patrick:	 Tell my parents I love them.
SpongeBob:	 Ahh!
SpongeBob:	 Hit the dirt!
Patrick:	  That was sheer beauty.
Squidward:	 Taking a walk... walk... walk. 
Squidward:	  Home.
Patrick:	 SpongeBob? What's happening?
SpongeBob:	 I don't know.
SpongeBob:	 Aw, poor guy was just sleepy. Looks like we're gonna be here a while. See you in the morning, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Oh, yeah. I should probably...
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Aww.
SpongeBob:	 Aww.
Gary:	  Meow.
Patrick:	  This isn't my rug! Where—where am I? Who am I?  Who am I?  How am I?
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, Patrick, calm down! You're at my house! Oh, and that is your rug.
Patrick:	 Oh, yeah.  Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie. Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie.
SpongeBob:	  Squidward, time to wake up. Wake up, little Squidward.  Patrick, Squidward won't wake up.
Patrick:	 Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie!  Wake up, little Squidward, wake up!
SpongeBob:	 Maybe we should get him up.
Both:	  Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Both:	 Wake up!
Both:	 Wake up!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, this is bad. Squidward won't make his audition with the Philharmonic Orchestra. What can we do?
Patrick:	 Oh, we'll have to create another Squidward in the lab.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, you are a genius!
Patrick:	 Eureka!
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick. It didn't work.
Patrick:	 Ooh, we've tried everything under the ocean and we failed! If only we could just crawl up inside Squidward and play him like a puppet.
SpongeBob:	 That's it! We could crawl up inside Squidward and play him like a puppet!
Patrick:	 Oh, whose dumb idea was that?
SpongeBob:	 Yours.
Patrick:	 Well, it sounds good to me.
French Narrator:	 Later...
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Patrick, you go in first and control his arms and legs. Then I'll go in and control the brain.
Patrick:	 Okay.
Patrick:	 Eww.  It tickles.
SpongeBob:	 How's that feel, buddy?
Patrick:	 Not bad. Okay, get on my shoulders.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Patrick, I'm gonna see if I can make Squidward talk.
SpongeBob:	  My name is Squidward, and I think SpongeBob is a lamebrain. 
Patrick:	  Wow, you sound more like him than—than Squidward! 
SpongeBob:	 All right, Patrick, we've got a date at the Bikini Bottom Philharmonic. Let's get going.
SpongeBob:	  Whoa, whoops. Watch out. Take it easy.
Worker:	 Hey!
SpongeBob:	 Left foot, right foot.
SpongeBob:	 Whoa! Excuse me. Sorry.
SpongeBob:	 Pardon me.
Officer Rob:	 Hey, Twinkle Toes, you're in a no dancing zone. Now beat it.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, I just realized I don't know where the concert hall is.
SpongeBob:	 Uh, let's ask someone.
SpongeBob:	  Excuse me, ma'am. I'm looking for the concert hall.
SpongeBob:	  Whoa!
Miss Snell:	 Young man, you don't need a concert hall. You need a hospital.
Handsome Fish:	 Great Neptune, you're hideous!  I manage a freak show and you're exactly the kind of act I need.
Kid:	 Mommy, look! It's Frankenstein!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Patrick! That bus is going to the concert hall!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, do you have any change?
Patrick:	 One second.
Nat Peterson:	 Hey, I wasn't born yesterday. That'll be three fares.
Nat Peterson:	 Hmm, what some people won't do to cheat the system. 
French Narrator:	 Moments later...
Maestro Mackerel:	 And don't come back!
Musician:	 Oh, man. That conductor's brutal.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Whoa!
SpongeBob:	  I was just, oh, um,  the thing is not on the thing.  Oh, uh...
Maestro Mackerel:	 Who is that imbecile?
Octavius Rex:	 Squidward Tentacles. Apparently he's a clarinet player. 
Maestro Mackerel:	 All right, whenever you're ready.
SpongeBob:	  The clarinet, where's his clarinet?
Patrick:	 Oh, I got it.
SpongeBob:	 Ew, why'd you put it there?
Patrick:	 I guess I never actually thought of the moment where we'd have to play it.
SpongeBob:	  Let's see, the ability to play clarinet has got to be in his brain somewhere. It's just a matter of squeezing it out.
Maestro Mackerel:	  All right, thank you, next!
Both:	 Huh?
Maestro Mackerel:	 He's magnificent.
Squidward:	 What—what's going on here? Where am I? I'm at the audition. I'm playing, but I'm not in control. I—I feel like I've been taken over by something.
Patrick:	 What's going on?
SpongeBob:	 I don't know what's happening! I'm losing control!
Squidward:	  Must... gain... control!
Maestro Mackerel:	 That's an unusual playing style, but still. He sounds magnificent.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, I don't think I can command his brain much longer!
Patrick:	 Me neither, SpongeBob!
Squidward:	 What was that—SpongeBob? Patrick? You're inside me?! Oh, how did this happen? Get out of my mind!
Squidward:	 Get out of my body! Just—just—just get out!
Both:	 Ta-da!
Squidward:	 Oh, I am going to lambaste you two!
Maestro Mackerel:	 You're a wizard. A magical, musical wizard.
Squidward:	 I—huh? Oh.
Maestro Mackerel:	 Yes, yes! Oh, bring us the ecstasy, maestro!
Squidward:	 I envy you common people. For you are about to have the glorious honor of hearing me play Gustav Mollusk's Symphony No. 5 in C Sharp Minor. For I am in complete control.
French Narrator:	 Later...
