SpongeBob:	 Cause you're so sweet... Get it?! Cause pineapples are sweet, and you are sweet also as well. Get it?! 
Patrick:	 Hey buddy. You still got that bucket of cheese?  Oh no! He's... not right! Don't worry, pal! I'll help you! 
Patrick:	 Buddy! You okay?
SpongeBob:	 Ahhh. Patrick, Thank you so much! If it weren't for your tremendous gorilla strength, I would've been a goner! If there's anything I can do to return the favor, anything at all... you just let me know. Anyway, back to my Karate exercises.  Oh, and help yourself to the cheese bucket. Thanks again buddy. HIYA! 
Patrick:	   Hey! I want to learn how to do that. 
SpongeBob:	  What, what you mean karate?
Patrick:	 Uhhuh!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick... my dear, dear friend. Karate is a delicate art, a skill that takes years to...
Patrick:	 If I recall correctly, I seem to remember saving your life a few minutes ago.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah... However...
Patrick:	 I also remember you saying, "If there's anything you can do to return the favor, anything at all... to let you know.
SpongeBob:	 Well I did say that Patrick but, well, karate is about finesse, not so much brute strength. You see, there's so much you don't know. You have not even scratched the surface of the surface. 
Patrick:	 Then teach me.
SpongeBob:	 As you wish, just remember one thing. With power, comes responsibility.
Patrick:	 Oh yeah Mama! 
SpongeBob:	 Okay. Lets start off simple. This is a basic move called "the inverted whirlpool".
Patrick:	 Inverty whirpey... Got it! 
Patrick:	 Woohoo! That was awesome!
SpongeBob:	 Think you can handle that?
Patrick:	 Yeah! Yeah!  Ha Ha Ha Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!  Hey, how do you stop this thing? 
Harold:	 Neptune's trousers! What's that?! 
SpongeBob:	 Now this is very easy, watch closely.  Haa-haah. You got it?
Patrick:	 Definitely! 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, I didn't want to have to say this... but you're... you're unteachable. 
Patrick:	 What?! I...!  Barnacles!
SpongeBob:	  Look what you did to this wall of cinder blocks. In all my years of training, I've never seen a perfect slice. No ones ever been able to execute such a clean karate chop through a wall of cinder!
Patrick:	 Wow!
SpongeBob:	 You're a natural! A karate genius!
Patrick:	 Clamo!
SpongeBob:	  Now let's put your new skills to the test. This is sharpened, tempered steel. Now don't be frustrated if it takes a few tri- . Wow. Amazing! 
SpongeBob:	 This is an abandoned, broad-ironed steamboat, solid as a rock. Think you got what it takes? 
SpongeBob:	 Ahhh... better luck next time. 
Patrick:	 Yeah! I bet I can chop anything! 
Sadie:	 AAAAAHHHH!
Patrick:	 HIIIII-
SpongeBob:	  Noooooo! What did I tell you?!
Patrick:	 I'm a genius?
SpongeBob:	 Not that!  ...this. : With power... comes responsibility. That means no chopping of any life from or their property. You understand?
Patrick:	 Yesss...
SpongeBob:	 Good!  Oh man, I'm late for work.  See you later, buddy. Don't forget what I said.
Patrick:	 Okay! I'm a genius! 
Patrick:	  Karate power! 
Squidward:	  What's this? Hhmmm... haven't seen this before.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, look, it's Patrick!
Patrick:	 Hi-yah SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 What are you doing... 
SpongeBob:	 *Gasps* Dear Neptune!
Patrick:	 Good day, gents! Ahhh, Squidward, I would like a HIYAAA!
Squidward:	 A... What?
Patrick:	 I said one Krusty Combo. Don't you speak karate?
Squidward:	 
Patrick:	  Looks delish.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, don't you think you're taking your perfect slice too far?
Patrick:	 I don't know what you're talking about. You're the one who called me a karate genius. And, frankly, I'm offended by your previous accusation. I don't need this! I beg you good due.
SpongeBob:	 But, but, but-
Patrick:	 No buts! just hands. 
SpongeBob:	 Oooohhh!
Mr. Krabs:	 You do realize I'm taking that out of your pay check.
Patrick:	 Uuuuuhhhhh... Seaweed Surprise! Also!... uuuuuuhhhhh... Malted Coral Crunch!  Oooh... Ooh, also, Lipids and Creme!
Ice Cream Man #1:	 Were all out. In fact, were out of everything, which means you owe us $86.50
Patrick:	 
Ice Cream Man #1:	 I say, pay up before I call the cops.
Patrick:	 You dare refuse my barter?!?! Than accept my chop!  Ahhh... I don't feel so good.
Ice Cream Man #2:	 Aha! Hand in the tip jar again, eh! 
Patrick:	  What is that wonderful stench?  Whatcha got there?
Harold:	 Spinach and chocolate spaghetti in calamari sauce. You wanna bite?
Patrick:	  NO! It's more fun to chop! Hahahahahahaha! 
Patrick:	 I win, I win, I win! 
Patrick:	 HIYAA HIYAA-
Lifeguard fish:	 Help! Help! There's a mad chopper on the loose!
SpongeBob:	 Mad chopper! Patrick!
Lifeguard fish:	 We need the cops, kid!
SpongeBob:	 Cops? No, that won't be necessary. I'll handle this, citizen.
Lifeguard fish:	 Don't do it kid. 
SpongeBob:	 Unhand my ankle, sir, my friend needs me.
Lifeguard fish:	 You don't know what you're doing. Don't walk out that door! NOOOOO! 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, just the man I was looking for. I wanted to thank you, buddy. 
SpongeBob:	 For what?
Patrick:	 For teaching me how to karate chop, silly.
SpongeBob:	 You gotta stop, buddy, you're destroying the entire town!
Patrick:	  Wooooooooooo.
SpongeBob:	 Just stop chopping, okay, Patrick?
Patrick:	 You got it, buddy. No more karate chops! 
SpongeBob:	 You're still chopping!
Patrick:	 I know! Weird, huh?
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, stop it!
Patrick:	 Oh. Okay. I know, I'll stop a chop, with a chop! 
SpongeBob:	 You must resist!  AHHHHHAAHH! 
SpongeBob:	 Wait up, Patrick!  Triton's tunic!
Fish:	 He's headed straight for the Barg'N-Mart!
All:	 AHHHHHHHHH!
Patrick:	 HIYA YA! Not the muffin display... YAAAAH!
News Reporter:	 This just in, a mad man is chopping everything.
Patrick:	 Not the giant-screen TVs... Oh no!

Patrick:	 YA YA HIYA AYA!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SPONGEBOB!!! Oh no, I'm so sorry, my best friend, crushed by all this rubble, entombed in this cheap, plastic bag. 
Dennis:	 That isn't your friend, you kelp-for-brains, those are cleaning sponges.
Patrick:	 So I haven't crushed the life of my best friend in the world?
Dennis:	 Ummmm...I wouldn't say that.
Patrick:	  SpongeBob! Oh no!  Ohhh, I'll never forgive myself  No! I'll never forgive you! 
SpongeBob:	  Oh, hi, Patrick. What did I miss?
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, you're okay!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick! Your arm!
Patrick:	 Ha! Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm a sea star. My limbs grow back. See?
SpongeBob:	 Hooray for regeneration!
Patrick:	 And in the spirit of healing, I vow to use my hands only to join things together, starting here! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, great job, Patrick! I like the unnatural details.
Patrick #2:	 HIYAAA!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick! I thought you gave up chopping!
Patrick:	 Oh I did. Unfortunately, we sea stars have limbs that grow new bodies.
Patrick #2:	 HIYYAA!
