Pearl:	 Then promise me you'll give me a real party this year. And don't be cheap!  Hi, girls.
Friend #1:	 Hi, Pearl.
Pearl:	 Are you guys coming to my totally coral birthday party tomorrow?
Friend #1:	 I don't know, Pearl. Is this going to be as totally coral as last year, when your dad passed out paper clips as party favors? 
Judy:	 Remember the time we all had to share one balloon?  Please.
Friend #2:	 Remember the pony ride? 
Friend #1:	 I can't wait to see how he ruins this year. 
Pearl:	 Daddy!
Mr. Krabs:	 Everybody brace for impact!
Pearl:	 Tell me you've got something totally coral planned for my birthday party.
Mr. Krabs:	 Now, now, don't snap your mizzenmast. Everything is all set. Why, I've already got the party favors--bubble wrap!  This year's gonna be a blast.
Pearl:	 Daddy, you ruined all my birthday parties. But you better not ruin this one. Now promise me you won't be cheap.
Mr. Krabs:	  I promise.
Pearl:	 Good, because I made a list.  Now I want everything on this list at my party.  Bye. I'll be at the mall with my friends.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 While I plan the party, I want you to buy Pearl's present.  Here you go, boy.
SpongeBob:	 What's this, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 It's me credit card. You use it instead of money.
SpongeBob:	 I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money?
Mr. Krabs:	 Exactly.
SpongeBob:	 Wow.
Mr. Krabs:	 Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work.
SpongeBob:	 Detective work--I'm going undercover.
Pearl:	 So, that's when Marcy told me that Julie said that Angela did like Brad.
Friend #1:	 Oh.
SpongeBob:	  Angela likes Brad.
Pearl:	  Oh my gosh, this is the greatest thing I have seen in the whole world.
SpongeBob:	  I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic. 
Cashier:	  Mr Krabs, huh? Quick--how do you spell "Krabs"?
SpongeBob:	 Umm...I'm pretty sure it has a 'B' in it.
Cashier:	 Close enough.  There you go, kid.
SpongeBob:	 That's it? Hmmm, I'll never understand the workings of high finance.
Pearl:	  Wow, this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in the whole world. Glitter gloss!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, no, I bought the wrong present.
Judy:	 Pearl, you have got to see this.
Pearl:	 Coming, Judy.
Mary:	 Oh...hmmm... 
SpongeBob:	 Now this is obviously the greatest present ever.
Pearl:	  This is the greatest thing in the whole world! 
Squidward:	 The banner's up, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 I've had that since the day she was born. I got it on sale.
Squidward:	 I'm sure she'll love it, Mr. Krabs.
Pearl:	 This sea pony is the cutest thing ever. Do you want to come home and be my pony?  Whee! 
Judy:	 Pearl, come here. This is so coral. 
Pearl:	 Oh my gosh, it's Billy Fishkins.
All:	 Hi, Billy!
Billy:	 Meep. 
SpongeBob:	  Isn't he dreamy? 
Cashier:	 Price check on 4.
Billy:	 Meep.
Squidward:	 I finished Pearl's portrait, Mr. Krabs. It's a true masterpiece. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor.
Squidward:	 Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty.
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'.
Squidward:	 Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money.
Mr. Krabs:	 You're a real fan, huh?
Squidward:	 Oh yeah, I know all their songs.
Mr. Krabs:	 All their songs?
Pearl:	 Wouldn't it be cool if my dad got me this for my birthday?
Friend #1:	 It sure would be. If he was cool, which he's not. 
Pearl:	 Yeah, he probably got me another box of staples.
Mr. Krabs:	 It's almost time for the party to start!
SpongeBob:	 I'm back, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?
SpongeBob:	 the delivery truck will be here momentarily.
Squidward:	 Here she comes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Everybody get into position. 
All:	 Happy birthday! 
Judy:	 "It's a boy"?! 
Pearl:	 Daddy! 
Friend #1:	 Stale popcorn.  It tastes like dishwater.
Squidward:	 It is dishwater. 
Pearl:	  Is that supposed to be me?  It's made out of Krabby Patties! Gross.
Mr. Krabs:	 Who wants cake?
Pearl:	 Well, the cake does look good.  It's made out of cardboard?!
Mr. Krabs:	 And frosting.
Friend #1:	 Well, Pearl, 16 lame parties in a row. Must be a new record. Let's get out of here.
Pearl:	 Wait, don't leave. My dad got Boys Who Cry to play. You did get Boys Who Cry, right?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, even better sweetie. Hit it. 
Squidward:	 Hello, ladies.  When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!
Friend #2:	 Hey, that is not Boys Who Cry.
Judy:	 Yeah!
Friend #2:	 Boo!
Friend #1:	 What a rip-off!!
Judy:	 This stinks!
Pearl:	 Daddy, how could you? I gave you a list. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Pearl, come back. 
Pearl:	 You ruined everything! You couldn't stop being cheap, even for me. 
Mr. Krabs:	 I'll make it up to you somehow, Pearl.
SpongeBob:	 That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go! 
Pearl:	 You bought me a boat?
Mr. Krabs:	 I did? I mean...I did?
Friends:	 Wow.
Pearl:	 Oh, daddy, I don't know how it could get better than this.
SpongeBob:	 Just watch.  Hit it boys! 
Endsong:	 Boys Who Cry "It's All About You"
Mr. Krabs:	 Boy, how much is all this costing me?
SpongeBob:	 Here's the receipt.
Mr. Krabs:	  I ought to...
Pearl:	 Oh, daddy, you got me everything I wanted. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Ah, nothing's too good for me daughter. Heh.
SpongeBob:	 You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't push your luck, boy.
