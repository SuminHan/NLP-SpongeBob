SpongeBob:	 It's time to grow myself large and wide. 
Sandy:	 Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?
SpongeBob:	 Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumping iron. Check it out. 
Sandy:	 Well, you're smelly.
SpongeBob:	 All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set. 
Sandy:	 Uhh, I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob but you won't see any progress with those.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, really?
Sandy:	 That is, if you want arms like these.  Or these!  Or these! 
SpongeBob:	 Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help.
Sandy:	 Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program.
SpongeBob:	 Wow, really? That'd be great Sandy! I can see me now.  Yeah... that would change everything!
Sandy:	 Be at my place at 5 a.m. Oh! And you'll need a water helmet.  Come on, SpongeBob, it's only push-ups! Come on. Come on! You can do it! 
SpongeBob:	 One. 
Sandy:	  Alright, put 'em up!
SpongeBob:	  They're up.
Sandy:	 Ding ding!  Feeling the burn?
SpongeBob:	 I'm-fee-ling-some-thing! 
Sandy:	 Well, now that we've got warmed up, it's time for the arm-cruncher.
SpongeBob:	 Arm-cruncher, great.  This squirrel's trying to kill me!
Sandy:	  This is it.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, that's great, Sandy. Well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye.  This working-- Ow. --thing isn't working-Ow.  Ow. Ow. Ow.
TV:	 Hey, you! Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy! "Oh, I'm a little peanut worm." Are you too much of a wimp to work out? Are you a weakling built like a sponge? Well, now you too can have muscles.
SpongeBob:	 Huh?
TV:	 With Anchor arms!  They slip on like a glove. Just add air.  How big do you want 'em?  Normal?  Veiny? And for the ladies...  ...hairy.  I was a wimp before Anchor arms. Now, I'm a jerk and everybody loves me. So order now, wimp!
SpongeBob:	 Wow, now that's a good idea!
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone!  Hi, Squidward!
Squidward:	  SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs:	  Huh?
SpongeBob:	 Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 Mother of pearl! 
Fish:	 Ow...
SpongeBob:	 Hi, guys. 
Larry:	 SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob:	  Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait...wait...  They're big aren't they?
Larry:	 Dude, you're ripped!
SpongeBob:	  Thank...You. I've been working out. Excuse me a second.  Yeah. Anyone up for the...  ...juice bar?
Scooter:	 I'm tellin' ya, he's huge!
Sandy:	 Have you guys seen SpongeBob anywhere?
Scooter:	 You mean 'MuscleBob BuffPants'? He's in there! 
Sandy:	 Uhh, whatever. Thanks.
SpongeBob:	 I start off with 20 raw eggs everyday. But that's just me.
Sandy:	 Pardon me.
SpongeBob:	 Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there. 
Fish:	 Who me? 
SpongeBob:	 I remember when I used to look like you, too.  But, that was a long time ago.
Bartender:	 Here's your drink, sir.
SpongeBob:	 Thank you.  Yeah...
Sandy:	 SpongeBob? Wha-where'd you get those muscles?
SpongeBob:	 I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results.  Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better.
Sandy:	 Heck, what's your secret?
SpongeBob:	 What?
Sandy:	 Your secret workout. What is it? 
SpongeBob:	 Hmmm, well...I, uhh...first I take my hand and I do this... 
Larry:	 Are you kidding?
SpongeBob:	 Do these muscles lie? 
Sandy:	 I'm glad to see you found an exercise program that works for you.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me.
Sandy:	 Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test.
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, what do you mean?
Sandy:	 The big Mussel Beach anchor tossing competition. It's today! Everybody'll be there!
Bartender:	 Here's your drink. 
Sandy:	 Hey, with those arms, you'll do great!
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, well, I'm not sure.
Sandy:	 C'mon, let's go.
SpongeBob:	 Now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a...  Sandy, wait!
