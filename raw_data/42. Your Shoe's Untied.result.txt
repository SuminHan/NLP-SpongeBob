Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Gary!  Uh, uh, I was just looking for the sports channel, Gary.  Come in!
Patrick:	  Hey, SpongeBob, wanna see my new shoes? 
SpongeBob:	 Wow! Those are great, Patrick! Let's see what they look like on your feet.
Patrick:	 Uh...  Wouldn't you rather see them on...  My hands?
SpongeBob:	 Okay...  And we can wear gloves on our feet  and hats on our captain's quarters, too. 
Patrick:	 Uh, actually... I have a confession to make.  I don't know how to tie my shoelaces.
SpongeBob:	  Do you know how lucky you are to have a friend like me?
Patrick:	 Yes. 
SpongeBob:	 Look at this knot. Have you ever seen a more perfectly executed shoe-fastening bow?
Patrick:	 Gosh... Probably not.
SpongeBob:	 I learned when I was just a boy, Patrick and I'm willing to pass on what I know. Go sit over there  and let an old pro show you how to do it.  Pay close attention, Patrick. Well, you start  by taking one lace per hand...  And then you... Uh, you gotta... Loop the, the...
Patrick:	 Are you sure you know how to do it?
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, please, shoe-tying requires peace and quiet. Okay, where was I?
Patrick:	  Your shoes are still untied. 
SpongeBob:	  Well,  I guess you don't want me to show you how to do it.
Patrick:	 I'm sorry!  I won't interrupt anymore!
SpongeBob:	 I've got it! The first rule of shoe-tying is always start with your right foot. Now the lesson will officially begin.  That's... "knot" right.  Get it? Knot... right... hmm...
Patrick:	 No.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, no more fooling around.  I've got it! 
Patrick:	 What was that? Are you okay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, aren't you late for something?
Patrick:	 Oh, poop deck, You're right!  We'll have to do this lesson   later! Bye SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 I can't believe I've forgotten how to tie my own shoes. They've been tied as long as I can remember.  Well, I'll remember after a good night's sleep.  Oh... No big deal. I'll remember sooner or later.  'Cause I'm ready! I'm... read...  ...y!  I'm read...  ...Ooh!  I'm read...  ... Uh!  I'm read...  ...Ooy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Uh! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Doy! I'm read... Duh! 
Patrick:	 Oh, hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	  Oh, no! I can't let Patrick see I still haven't tied my shoes. 
Patrick:	  Hey, SpongeBob... You're shorter. Have you been dieting?
SpongeBob:	 Well, a sponge has to look his spongiest.  Well, I've gotta get to work.  Oh, barnacles! maybe I should just lay here.
Squidward:	  Those patties aren't going to cook themselves, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 He's right! Got to make... Krabby Patties!  Laces or no laces!  Ah... I just have to stand in this one spot.  Ta-da! A perfect patty.
Squidward:	 Alright, SpongeBob, hand it over. Well? 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Squidward, I've got an idea! How about you come get it?
Squidward:	  Oh, gee, SpongeBob, that's a great idea. And maybe I should cook the patties and do the dishes and wear square pants and live in a pineapple while you wait in the unemployment line!
SpongeBob:	 No!
Squidward:	 Then bring that patty here now!
SpongeBob:	  Okay, Squidward.  Here I come. I'm coming over.  I'm bringing the patty to you. Here comes the patty. No problem. I'm walking...the Krabby Patty...over to Squidward. All right, Squidward. I'm giving you the patty... For the hungry customer... So they can eat it... When I give it to you... Which is right... now. 
Squidward:	 Uh, SpongeBob? I'm over here! Now move!
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Squidward.  Just slowly move your leg. Walk over there... with the...  Dah!
Squidward:	 SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob:	 I'm sorry, Squidward.
Squidward:	  SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 I'll just make another... Doh! 
Squidward:	 Sponge... 
SpongeBob:	 Hold it... Doy!  Let me just...  Doy! 
Old Man Jenkins:	 What's the holdup?
Squidward:	  I think my heart just stopped.  It's Sponge...  ...Bob's fault! 
SpongeBob:	  I've failed. My career is over. I'm sorry, spatula.  I'm sorry, hat.  I'm sorry, floor.  I am sorry, Krabby Patties. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Let's see, a five-letter word for happiness. "Money." 
Customer:	  This is the worst service we've ever had! We're going to the Chum Bucket! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Wait! Wait! Don't go! 
Harold:	 Oh yeah, we are definitely out of here. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Wait! Wait, don't go! That's me money walking out the door! What's the meaning of this, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward:	 It's SpongeBob's fault. 
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, get out here!  More.  More.  All the way, boy!  What be the matter, SpongeBob? I ought to make you walk the plank for this.
SpongeBob:	 I'm sorry Mr. Krabs, it's just that I... I...
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes?
SpongeBob:	 I... I... I... I... I... I...
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes, yes, yes?
SpongeBob:	 I... I... I... I... I...
Mr. Krabs:	 Out with it, boy!  What is it?
SpongeBob:	 I forgot how to tie my shoes.
Mr. Krabs:	  That's all?
SpongeBob:	 So you'll show me how?
Mr. Krabs:	 I don't wear shoes. 
SpongeBob:	 Could you show me how to tie my shoes?
Tom:	 Uh, fins? 
SpongeBob:	 Could you show me how to tie my shoes?
Eel:	 Well, I would, but, sadly, I am only an eel. 
SpongeBob:	  Could any of you show me how to tie my laces?  Could you, you, you, you, or you show me how to tie a knot?  Could you show me how to tie a simple knot?  Could you show me how to tie my shoes?  Could you show me how to tie my shoes?
Painty:	 Arr, I be just a painting of a head.
SpongeBob:	 Doesn't anybody know how to tie a knot?! 
Flying Dutchman:	 Did somebody say knot?
SpongeBob:	  I did.
Flying Dutchman:	 So, you want to tie knots, do ya? Well, do ya?!
SpongeBob:	 Yes, please, Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir.
Flying Dutchman:	 Then you've come to the right flying ghost, kid. You're looking at the first place winner in the fancy knottin' contest for the last 3,000 years!
SpongeBob:	 Hooray! 
Flying Dutchman:	  You're gonna have to not do that. And stop staring at me with them big old eyes.  Now, stand back and watch me be .  Haha! Behold!  The pretzel knot!
SpongeBob:	 Ooh... 
Flying Dutchman:	 The double diamond knot!  The square knot!  The constrictor!  The gut knot!  The pillow knot.  The butterfly knot. 
SpongeBob:	 Ooh...
Flying Dutchman:	 Wait, There's more!  The monkey chain!  The monkey's fist!  The monkey! 
Monkey Knot:	 Ooh, ooh!
Flying Dutchman:	 This one here's a loop knot, otherwise known as the 'poop loop'. 
Rope:	 Poop!
SpongeBob:	  Those are great, Mr. Flying Dutchman, sir. Now can you show me how to tie my shoes?
Flying Dutchman:	  I don't know how to tie me shoes. I haven't worn shoes for over 5,000 years!  But sometimes I like to wear this little sock over me ghostly tail. 
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Not now, Gary.
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 I'm not in the mood, Gary.
Gary:	 Meow.  Meow.
