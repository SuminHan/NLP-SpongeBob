Squidward:	  Have I told you how beautiful you are? Your tentacles, your nose, your eyes...a little lopsided.  There. And now that I've been immortalized in wax, I have conquered all artistic media. Come on, my precious reflection, smile! 
SpongeBob:	 Hike, Patrick, hike!  You just lost three points.  One. Two. Five!  G-7!
Patrick:	 G-7? King me! King me!  I lose!
SpongeBob:	 But it's not Tuesday, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Tartar sauce! 
Squidward:	 Hey! What are you invertebrates doing?
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 We don't know.
Squidward:	 Hey Patrick, do you know what time it is?
Patrick:	 Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's... 
Squidward:	 Time to find some other game to play! 
SpongeBob:	 Now what?
Patrick:	  We could toss that shell back and forth.
SpongeBob:	  Okay... ready! 
Patrick:	 Go! 
SpongeBob:	 I got it! I got it!  I got it! I got it! I got it!  Remember Patrick, finders keepers.
Patrick:	 There it is! 
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 I got it! I got it! 
Patrick:	 Bonus points! 
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious.
Patrick:	 Don't worry. I know how to do this. 
SpongeBob:	 Get off him, Patrick! 
Patrick:	 What are you worried about?  He looks better already. 
SpongeBob:	 But he still feels cold. 
Patrick:	 Well, let's go put him in the warm.
SpongeBob:	 Do you think he'll be okay?
Patrick:	 You know, you worry too much.  The Patrick is here and SpongeBob I know a lot about head injuries, believe...  ...me. Hey, what's that on your shoe? 
SpongeBob:	 I don't know.
Patrick:	 It kind of looks like... 
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 Squidward! 
SpongeBob:	 No, no, that part goes here.
Patrick:	 Yeah-yeah, that's it, uh-huh.
SpongeBob:	 We're almost there. We can do this.
Patrick:	 It's working, it's working...
SpongeBob:	 This is working.  Patrick, this isn't working!
Patrick:	 Look! 
SpongeBob:	 I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!
Patrick:	 Oh, I thought he was dead. 
Squidward:	  What are you doing here?! Well? Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to...?
SpongeBob:	 No, stay back!
Squidward:	 What is the matter with you two?
Patrick:	 Don't, don't hurt us!
SpongeBob:	 It was an accident!
Squidward:	 What are you two talking about?  Look what you've done to me! When I get my hands on you, I'll...
SpongeBob:	 Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost!  Spare us your ghostly anger! 
Patrick:	 Oh yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Please don't haunt us!
SpongeBob:	 We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us! 
Squidward:	 Enough! Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a a horrible fate. All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand.
SpongeBob:	 Does that include...
Squidward:	 Quiet! Now, do as you're told! Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!
Patrick:	  I think they make a cream for that now. 
SpongeBob:	 Here?
Squidward:	 Too hot. 
SpongeBob:	 Here?
Squidward:	 No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going. 
SpongeBob:	 Here?
Squidward:	 Toulouse-Lautrec. 
SpongeBob:	 Too tired... 
Squidward:	 Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy.  Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment.
SpongeBob:	 Only the freshest, o spooky one.  A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness.  A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness. 
Patrick:	 One watermelon fresh from the manure field, your spookiness. 
SpongeBob:	 Art thou not pleased? 
Squidward :	 Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that's very difficult to find.
Patrick :	 What do you hunger for, master?
SpongeBob:	 Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.
Squidward:	 Cherry pie.  Where'd you get that?
Patrick:	 I found it. 
Squidward:	 Well, go find it again!  SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around.  That's better. Now jog in place.  Say flank steak.
SpongeBob:	 Flank steak.
Squidward:	 I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop.  Now, play me an elaborate song with this! 
SpongeBob:	 But this is just a piece of tissue paper.
Squidward:	 Oh, my.  Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo. 
SpongeBob:	 I can't do it! 
Squidward:	 Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, because you're not allowed to leave that spot until I hear a song.  What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.
Patrick:	  I found it. 
Squidward:	 I'll take that! 
Patrick:	 Yes, your ghostliness!  This is fun.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, are you ready for this?
Patrick:	 Yes. 
SpongeBob:	 Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming? 
Patrick:	 Yes.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, it's this way.
Patrick:	 Where?
SpongeBob:	 Here.
Patrick:	  Oh, coming!  How are we going to clean up all this mess?
SpongeBob:	 It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off! 
Patrick:	  Oh look, you missed some. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman.  It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?
Patrick:	 We're going to go shopping?
SpongeBob:	 No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest. 
Squidward:	 Ow, what the heck was that?
SpongeBob:	 Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.
Squidward:	 Ceremony for what?
SpongeBob:	 We're going to put you to rest.
Squidward:	 I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah.
Squidward:	 Well, I'm going to go check. 
SpongeBob:	 Okay, get in.
Squidward:	 Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing.
SpongeBob:	 But you said we could put you to rest.
Squidward:	 I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!
Squidward :	 Now what? 
SpongeBob:	 I wrote Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but...  Oh, hi Squidward. Does this look deep enough?
Squidward:	 SpongeBob!  Cut that out!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, look, the mourners have arrived. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?
SpongeBob:	 No, just into this hole. 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, I have a confession to make. 
SpongeBob:	 You're bald?
Squidward :	 No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!
SpongeBob:	 But-
Squidward:	 Do it!
SpongeBob:	 Go home.  But Master--
Squidward:	 I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and please stop doing me favors. 
SpongeBob:	 As you wish, master.
Squidward:	 D'oh!
Patrick:	 Boy, he really had us fooled.
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.
Patrick:	 You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, say that again.
Patrick:	 That again?
SpongeBob:	 No, the other thing.
Patrick:	 No, the other thing.
SpongeBob:	 No, what you said before when you...
Patrick:	 No, what you said before when you..
SpongeBob:	 Never mind. I've got an idea.
Patrick:	 Never mind! I've got an idea. 
SpongeBob:	 I can't reach him!
Patrick:	 Blow harder.  There he goes!
SpongeBob:	 Isn't he beautiful?
Patrick:	 How high's he going to go? 
SpongeBob:	 All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond.  Goodbye, friend.
Patrick:	 Happy trails! 
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 You're welcome!
SpongeBob:	 He's on the other side now.
Patrick:	 Yeah.  He's in a better place.
