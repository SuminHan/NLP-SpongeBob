Squidward:	 It's too quiet. Something isn't right around here.  Could it be? SpongeBob is gone for the evening.  Here's to a delightful evening alone with you, public television. 
Patrick:	 Do it again. Do it again.
SpongeBob:	 Ok. 
Squidward:	 Will you two be quiet?! I'm trying to watch public television. 
Patrick:	 Do it again, do it again.
Squidward:	 If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that.  What?
SpongeBob:	 Squidward! 
Squidward:	 You're still there, aren't you? 
SpongeBob:	 Good evening, Squidward.
Squidward:	 Not so fast. You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat?
Patrick:	 Yeah. We're here... 
Squidward:	 Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone?  SpongeBob? Patrick? Oh, what's the point? 
Patrick:	 Could you turn it up?
SpongeBob:	 Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?
Patrick:	 Squidward, what's this about?
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, how come he's so emotional?
Patrick:	 Is he the bad guy?
SpongeBob:	 Squidward?
Patrick:	 Squidward?
SpongeBob:	 Squidward?
Patrick:	 Squidward?
SpongeBob:	 Squidward?
Patrick:	 Squidward?
Squidward:	  That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen. Once again I'm going to have to leave my own home just to get some peace and quiet. Enjoy my TV. 
Patrick:	 Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny.
Squidward:	 I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. Pfah! They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement.  Oh.  Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob.  Jellyfish Fields. 
SpongeBob:	 What is that thing, Patrick?
Patrick:	 I dunno. Let's get a closer look. 
SpongeBob:	 Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him.
Patrick:	 Yeah, help him. Go away. Can't you tell nobody wants you? You're endangered.
SpongeBob:	 Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him.  Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly.  Here's your food bowl.
Patrick:	 And some kibble. 
SpongeBob:	 You can live here forever and ever.  Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met.  Smelly meet Gary.  Aww, look at that Smelly, Gary likes you.  Gary, no!  Gary. 
Patrick:	 I don't think Gary likes Smelly.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here.
Patrick:	 Ah! He can come home with me.
SpongeBob:	 That's a great idea, Patrick. You always wanted a pet.  Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house.  Bye, Smelly, have fun at Patrick's. 
Patrick:	 No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets.  Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch?  Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.  Almost.  Again.  So close.  Yeah, now you're...  Smelly! What's gotten into you?!  Hello, Animal Control? There's a wild animal loose in my house.  Sure, I'll hold.  Smelly! Come back. Smelly!
Police:	 Freeze! 
SpongeBob:	  Hmmm, what's all the commotion? 
Police:	 You're surrounded. There is no way out.
SpongeBob:	 Smelly.  Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal.
Police:	 Wild animals don't belong here, son. They belong in the zoo. Get 'em boys. 
SpongeBob:	 Smelly. 
Isabelle:	 Mommy, what is that thing?
Sadie:	 I don't know but it's hideous, isn't it? 
SpongeBob:	 This isn't good.
Patrick:	 You're absolutely right.  It needs mustard.
SpongeBob:	 No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is.  Ok, Patrick, remember the plan?
Patrick:	 Oh, yeah.  This one, right?
SpongeBob:	  No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison.
Patrick:	  Mmm, good plan.
SpongeBob:	  All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me. 
Patrick:	 You're my hero.  SpongeBob! Help! Ah! 
SpongeBob:	 Shh, we'll get caught.
Patrick:	 What! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud! 
SpongeBob:	  Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home.  Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick.  Smelly, you're free! 
Police:	 You're surrounded. There's no use trying to run.
SpongeBob:	 Run, Patrick, run!  Faster, Patrick. 
Patrick:	 I'll let Smelly go first. 
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us. 
Patrick:	 I think we lost them.
SpongeBob:	 Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much. 
Patrick:	 Hey, I see light.
SpongeBob:	 You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we?  Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us.  Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way. 
Patrick:	  I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob. Me, too, buddy. Me, too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong. 
Kelpy G:	 Ah... salutation, my children. Are you ready for your daily dose of smooth jazz? 
Squidward:	  Um... hi.
