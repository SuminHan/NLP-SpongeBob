Gary:	 Meow.  The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable!  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward:	 What?
SpongeBob:	 I'm ready, Squidward! 
Squidward:	 Ready to move?
SpongeBob:	 No, I'm ready to pass my boating test.  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore.  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!
Gus:	 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Hey, I just got my license!
SpongeBob:	  Hey, I'm getting mine next!
Gus:	 Hey, I doubt it! 
SpongeBob:	 Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. 
Mrs. Puff:	  I'm not ready. 
SpongeBob:	 Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!
Mrs. Puff:	  We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must...
SpongeBob:	 First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
Mrs. Puff:	 I know. Okay, #1: What is the front of the boat?
SpongeBob:	 The bow. 
Mrs. Puff:	 What is the back?
SpongeBob:	 Stern. 
Mrs. Puff:	 #3: Right is...
SpongeBob:	 Starboard.  Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924. 
Mrs. Puff:	 You've passed the oral test. What a surprise!  Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, in this boat right here?  Is it time already?
Mrs. Puff:	 Get in the boat, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Oh yeah, absolutely. 
Mrs. Puff:	 All you have to do is get on the track.  Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do?
SpongeBob:	 1924?
Mrs. Puff:	 No, no. First thing is to start the boat.  SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat.
SpongeBob:	 The boat?
Mrs. Puff:	 Okay, now what do you do next?
SpongeBob:	 Floor it?
Mrs. Puff:	 Yes... no, no! Don't floor it.
SpongeBob:	 Floor it?
Mrs. Puff:	 No, no, don't, don't floor it.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, floor it.
Mrs. Puff:	 No! No!  Oh, SpongeBob, why?
Fred:	 My leg!
SpongeBob:	  I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it thirty-seven times.
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, thirty-eight. 
Gary:	  Meow.
SpongeBob:	 No, Gary, I'm not walking.
Patrick:	  SpongeBob, this is star ranger, over.
SpongeBob:	  What is it, Patrick?
Patrick:	  I got a surprise for you.
SpongeBob:	  Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood.
Patrick:	  Get out of bed. 
SpongeBob:	  Okay, now what, Patrick?
Patrick:	  Go to your closet for a surprise. 
SpongeBob:	  Okay, I'm at the closet.
Patrick:	  Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?
SpongeBob:	  I don't know, Patrick. 
Patrick:	 Patrick SquarePants!
SpongeBob:	 Pat, don't do that.  I've got too much to worry about.
Patrick:	 What's the problem?
SpongeBob:	 I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven...
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 ...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers...  ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.
Patrick:	 Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. 
SpongeBob:	 How are we going to do that? 
Patrick:	 Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob:	 Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers.  Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? 
Patrick:	  Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing.  Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! Testing!  Testing!  Test. Do you read?!
SpongeBob:	 Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over.
Patrick:	  Got your apple ready?  Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on.  Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural. 
SpongeBob:	 Moo.
Patrick:	  No, no, get in the boat!  Give her the apple. 
SpongeBob:	 Here you go, ma'am. 
Mrs. Puff:	 Let's get this over with.  What's the first thing you do? 
SpongeBob:	 Uhh...
Patrick:	  Start the boat. 
SpongeBob:	 Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff:	 Whoa-ho! Huh? What?
SpongeBob:	 It's okay, it's only the boat.
Mrs. Puff:	 The boat? You started the boat?
SpongeBob:	 I... I think so.
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do?
SpongeBob:	 1924?
Patrick:	  No, no, put it in drive.
SpongeBob:	 Put it in drive?
Mrs. Puff:	 Yes, yes, yes!  Put it in drive. Then what?
SpongeBob:	  Floor it?
Mrs. Puff:	 No! 
Patrick:	  Freeze, mister!  Big toe. 
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh gracious. Oh gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven't crashed yet.
Patrick:	  Okay, you're coming to your first turn. 
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn.
Patrick:	  Left. 
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh!
Patrick:	  Right. 
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh! Oh my, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You're doing fine.
Mrs. Puff:	 Splendid! Wonderful!  There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head?  Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna?  And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers?  Oh, yes, but that would be cheating. 
Patrick:	 Cheating! 
SpongeBob:	 I'm cheating?! Mrs Puff!
Mrs. Puff:	 Yes, my star pupil?
SpongeBob:	 I think I'm cheating.
Mrs. Puff:	 What's that, dear? 
SpongeBob:	 I think I am cheating!
Mrs. Puff:	 You've... you've let go of the wheel.
SpongeBob:	 I do have an antenna under my hat.  There is a guy giving me all the answers. It's all true!  I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!
Patrick:	 What? 
SpongeBob:	 I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!
Mrs. Puff:	  The wheel, SpongeBob! The wheel...
SpongeBob:	 Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater...
Mrs. Puff:	 No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat!
SpongeBob:	 No... I'm cheating...!
Mrs. Puff:	 At least, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob:	 Cheating!
Mrs. Puff:	 Cheat that way!
SpongeBob:	 I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!
Mrs. Puff:	 It's okay to cheat today!
SpongeBob:	 No...!
Mrs. Puff:	 That way! Cheat that way!
SpongeBob:	 Cheater...! 
Mrs. Puff:	  Oh, SpongeBob, why?
SpongeBob:	 Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated.
Fred:	 My leg!
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff:	 It's okay, SpongeBob, you didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away. 
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester.  It'll be great!  Only now I don't even have my bike.
Gary:	  Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile!  Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!
