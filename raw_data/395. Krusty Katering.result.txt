Squidward:	 I cannot believe I let you talk me into this.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, come now, Mr. Squidward. Catering is a great way for you to make a little extra money. And me to make a lot!
Mr. Krabs:	 Any ideas?
Squidward:	 How's that?
Mr. Krabs:	 Perfect, now get out there and feed the rest of those kids.
Squidward:	 They all seem so... full of germs!
Mr. Krabs:	 Why, of course they're full of germs. They're kids. Why do you think I'm wearing this full-body latex covering? 
Squidward:	 Okay, I'm going in.
Squidward:	 Krabby Patty? Krabby Patty? 
Kid:	 Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 
Squidward:	 You're contaminating the food! Just pick one!
Squidward:	  I've been infected!
Patrick:	 Hey, kids, I'm a—
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, I'm not paying you to play hide-and-seek! These children want to be entertained! Get down here! 
Kid:	 I want a balloon animal.
Patrick:	 Uh, um.
Kid:	 What is it?
Patrick:	 A rock.
Mr. Krabs:	 Okay, birthday boy. Take a swing at that piñata, son.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oof!  Don't hit nice old Mr. Krabs.  It's the piñata you want, son.
Mr. Krabs:	 Me money! Do I look like a piñata to you, boy?
Billy:	 Yes, get him!
SpongeBob:	  Higher! Go higher!
SpongeBob:	 Uh, don't forget to take your shoes off before bouncing.
SpongeBob:	 Ow!
Squidward:	 We have to get out of here! These children are menaces!
Patrick:	 They tore off my head.
SpongeBob:	 Maybe we should make a break for it, Mr. Krabs.
Billy:	 I want my birthday cake!
Billy:	 Cake, cake!
Mr. Krabs:	 Come on, men, let's cheese it!
Ms. Mildred:	 Oh, my, are you the high-class caterers I hired for an extraordinarily large sum of money?
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes!
SpongeBob:	 No!
Mr. Krabs:	  Yes.
SpongeBob:	  No!
Mr. Krabs:	  Yes. 
Ms. Mildred:	 I do not have time for this tomfoolery. I have a mansion full of very high-class guests waiting for a high-class catering. Are you they or are you nay?
Mr. Krabs:	 Indubitably, madam. We are your high-class caterers.
Ms. Mildred:	 But where are your tuxedos?
Mr. Krabs:	 Tuxedos? Oh, just give us a moment to suit up, me good lady.
Squidward:	 Now, where are we going to get tuxedos from?
Mr. Krabs:	 You.
Squidward:	 Hey, what are you—
Squidward:	 Ew.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ready to serve you, Miss Money Bags—er, I—I mean, ma'am.
Ms. Mildred:	 Very nice. Here is your payment.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, you can't take that check. We're not high-class caterers.
Mr. Krabs:	  We are anything we need to be for me to make this money.
Mr. Krabs:	 Unless you wanna go back to the kids' party.
All:	 No!
Mr. Krabs:	 That's what I thought. Then start setting up inside.
Patrick:	 This place is so shiny.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, and so are the people.
Squidward:	 Oh, there's no way those people are gonna think our junk food is high class.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hmm, you might be right. SpongeBob, go find something to fancy-up the food.
SpongeBob:	 Fancy. Got it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Good, now I'll just get the lay of the land around here.
Billy:	 I want my birthday cake!
Mr. Krabs:	 Great Neptune's ghost!
Billy:	 I want my cake! I want my cake!
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, kid, easy, easy. Just calm down, will ya? I got your cake.
Billy:	 You did?
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah, yeah.  Your birthday cake is right through here. 
Billy:	 Where? I don't see any—
Mr. Krabs:	  Won't be seeing him again any time soon.
Billy:	 I. Want. My. Birthday. Cake!
Billy:	 I want my birthday cake!
SpongeBob:	 What do you think of this, Mr. Krabs?  I call it, "Krabby Pâté." Classy, huh? Serve it while it's hot, Patrick.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, were those jewels on the patties?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah. You said, "Fancy-up the food", so I found some shiny stuff for garnish. Got a whole box.
Mr. Krabs:	 What the—  SpongeBob, you can't just go around taking people's precious jewels!
SpongeBob:	 Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I was just doing what you told me.
Mr. Krabs:	  Don't worry about it. Just tell me where you got them gems from.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, upstairs. I went left, then right, then double and triple right, then down, up, and right 18 more times. Then do four somersaults, a barrel roll, jump backwards twice, spin till you get sick...  And you're there.
Mr. Krabs:	 Okay. 
Patrick:	 Fancy foods! Get your fancy foods here!
Guest 1:	 Delicious.
Patrick:	 I love delicious stuff. My turn!
Patrick:	 Yummy.
Guest 2:	 I'll take a slice of that.
Patrick:	 Mine! 
Guest 3:	 Ouch!
Squidward:	 Who wants food? I'm a mindless drone with food. Working for the man. Huh?
Squidward:	 Ooh. 
Squidward:	 Here you go, princess.
Squidward:	 Let's do this thing.
Squidward:	 Hey, where are you going?
Squidward:	 Oh, down here.
Squidward:	 I never heard of a marching quintet.
Squidward:	 Uh, wait for me. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me. Wait, wait—  Hey, hey! 
Mr. Krabs:	 All right, what did he say? 18 rights, then four lefts, or five? Ooh.
Billy:	 I want my birthday cake!
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh, you—get off! Enough of this! 
Billy:	 If you don't get me my birthday cake, I'll set off all these fireworks!
Mr. Krabs:	 Give me those! Young boy like yourself shouldn't be playing with fireworks. They're too dangerous.
Billy:	 Gosh, no one ever cared enough about me to explain that. It's like you're my real father.  May I hug you?
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh.
Ms. Mildred:	  Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh, uh, quick, in here! 
Billy:	 Why, father? Why?
Ms. Mildred:	  Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 Um, yes, ma'am?
Ms. Mildred:	  Mr. Krabs, we seem to be having some problems with the food service.
Patrick:	 Mine, mine!
Patrick:	 Mine, mine!
Mr. Krabs:	 Uh, I'll be right down to have a look. Just need to find something here. All right, where was I? Four somersaults and a barrel roll, I think.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, no! The food is for the guests!
Squidward:	 What the—?
Nathiel Waters:	 So then, I was all like—  Oof! Well, I never!
Guest 4:	 Food fight!
Ms. Mildred:	 Oh, my.
Mr. Krabs:	 Whoa.  This must be the place.  Hello? Ooh.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh-ee. That is one big—water bed?
Billy:	 Birthday cake!
Mr. Krabs:	 Dogfish!
Billy:	 Hi, Daddy!
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't call me that! And stop jumping on that water bed! You'll pop it!
Billy:	 Okay, Daddy!
Mr. Krabs:	  Get over here!
Billy:	 Hah, Daddy!
Mr. Krabs:	 Why, you little—
Billy:	 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mr. Krabs:	 Uh-oh.
Billy:	 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ms. Mildred:	 Stop it, everyone! You're ruining my par—  Oh, no, you did not!
Mr. Krabs:	 Barrel roll, four somersaults!
Mr. Krabs:	 Look out, flood's a-coming!
Mr. Krabs:	 Nice doing business with you!
Ms. Mildred:	 Come back here!
SpongeBob:	 Huh? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Whoa!
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, no.
Guests:	 Ooh!
Billy:	 Yay!  My cake!
Mr. Krabs:	 My check!
Ms. Mildred:	 My party!
