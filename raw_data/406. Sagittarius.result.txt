Narrator:	 And now, Astrology with Squidward.
Squidward:	  Today, we explore Sagittarius. Sign of the uh... half-horse, half-guy with a bow and arrow. The good thing about Sagitarians: they have great aim. The bad thing about them: they poop while they're walking. So never march behind them in a parade. My prediction for Sagittarius in the coming year: you won't eat enough green vegetables. I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon astrologer reminding you that if you smelt it, chances are, you dealt it.
