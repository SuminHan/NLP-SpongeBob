Narrator:	 Ah, Goo Lagoon. A stinky mud puddle to you and me. But to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom, a wonderful, stinky mud puddle. 
SpongeBob:	 What a great day.  Hey, Sandy! Look!  I'm Sandy!  Hey Sandy, who am I?  Hello, SpongeBob. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. 
Sandy:	 SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob:	 Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? 
Larry:	 Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.
Sandy:	 Hey, Larry.
Larry:	 You guys wanna go lift some weights?
Sandy:	 Sure.  Well come on, SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob:	  Coming. 
Larry:	 Give it a try, Sandy. 
SpongeBob:	 Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? 
Larry:	 How about a little more weight?  Observe. 
SpongeBob:	 All right, stand back, everyone. 
Sandy:	 Y'all watch this!  Way to go, Larry! 
SpongeBob:	 Could I borrow a couple of these?
Fish:	  Mm-hmm.  And now, with the addition of two, count 'em, two marshmallows. 
Scooter:	 THAT was too funny.  YOU are hilarious!
Sandy:	 Ain't he the funniest little Sponge you ever saw? 
Larry:	 Anybody up for some volleyball? 
SpongeBob:	 I got it!  Incoming!  Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again! 
Scooter:	 Once again, dude,  YOU have split my sides! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?
Sandy:	 Okay, here it comes! 
SpongeBob:	 I could use a hand here! 
Sandy:	 You okay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 I guess so...  ...except I ripped my pants! 
Scooter:	 You still got it, dude! 
Lou Vendor:	 May I help you?
SpongeBob:	 I'll take a banana split.
Lou:	 Uh, we don't have that.
SpongeBob:	 That's okay. I already split my pants! Get it? 
Lou:	  Tee-hee. Anything else?
SpongeBob:	 How about ripple?  No, thanks, already got one!  Is that a burger you're eating?
Harold:	 Why, yes, it is.
SpongeBob:	 You know what would go good with that?
Harold:	 No, what?
SpongeBob:	  Ripped... pants.  Ripped pants a la mode!  Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? 
Perch Perkins:	 Surf's up in the Goo Lagoon.  And here comes Larry, doing his trademark lay-back.  There goes Sandy, hanging ten... fingers, that is.  There goes SpongeBob...  ripping his pants again. 
Lifeguard:	 Hey, look! A cardboard box washed up on the beach.  Holy fish paste! It's a guy!  Why?! Why?! Why?! 
Sandy:	 SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	  Come closer.  I need... I need...
Lifeguard:	 What do you need? 
SpongeBob:	  A tailor.  Because I ripped my pants! 
Sandy:	 That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! Y'all had me worried sick!
Scooter:	 Dude... 
SpongeBob:	  Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think! Your public's waiting.  Let's see...  "Lifting weights - big laugh," "Frisbee in face - kills," "Surfing - knocks 'em dead," "Pretending to drown,"  NO. Come on, think! I got it! Hey, everybody!  Not ripped pants!  Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose!  Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We blew it, pants.
Pants:	 What do you mean, "we?" 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! 
Millie:	 No, I am. I forgot to put on sunscreen. 
SpongeBob:	 Ouch. 
Fish:	 No, I am. I got sand in my buns. 
Whale:	 No, I'm the biggest loser on the beach. They buried me in the sand and forgot me.
All:	 What happened to you?
SpongeBob:	 I lost my best friend.
All:	 How? 
SpongeBob:	 When I ripped...  my pants.  I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I  ripped my pants. 
All:	 ♪When big Larry came round just to put him down, SpongeBob turned into a clown, and no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and  ripped his pants!♪
SpongeBob:	  ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪
All:	 ♪Or sand in your buns!♪ 
SpongeBob:	 ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ 
Sandy:	 SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Sandy! 
Sandy:	 Your song is true. If y'all want to be my friend, just be yourself. 
Larry:	 [impressed with SpongeBob's singing during the big concert] SpongeBob, that was so righteous. Would you... sign my pants?
SpongeBob:	 Absolutely, buddy.
