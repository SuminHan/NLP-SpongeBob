SpongeBob:	  Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had.
Gary:	  Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Well, time to punch that clock. [] But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.  You are a winner.  And today's the first day of summer!  Happy first day of summer, Squidward!  Care to join me for solstice caroling?  Walking in the grass, it's so fine, don't need shoes in the summertime! 
Squidward:	 I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs:	 Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?
SpongeBob:	  Yeah.
Mr. Krabs:	  Whee-hoo! 
SpongeBob:	  Gee Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?
Mr. Krabs:	 The money!
SpongeBob:	 The money?
Mr. Krabs:	 Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!
SpongeBob:	 Oh.
Mr. Krabs:	 You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break. 
SpongeBob:	 Tell me more about summer break. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance.  Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever.  I guess that's what I like best.  Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal.  Come here, you little piggies!
SpongeBob:	 I've been taught the true meaning of summer.
Narrator:	 Later... 
SpongeBob:	  Almost closing time, Mr. K.
Mr. Krabs:	 What? But that's impossible.  What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children?  I guess summer isn't coming this year.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Playground? Luring away me young customers. Warm up the boat, SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob:	 See anything, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob.  So weak and malnourished.  With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing.  Breaks me heart. [] No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.
Mr. Krabs:	 True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do. 
SpongeBob:	 You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh? 
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob!  You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!
SpongeBob:	 Krabby Land, sir?
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes, Krabby Land!  Where a kid can have fun... for the right price.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?
Monroe:	 Monroe.
Mr. Krabs:	 Nice to meet you, Monroe. 
Monroe:	 Whee!
Mr. Krabs:	  Mmm... a-ha!  Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land!  Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.
Kids:	 We promise.
Mr. Krabs:	 All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land! []
Kids:	 Yeah! 
Tyler:	 Whoa! Ooh, where am I?
Mr. Krabs:	 Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability wavers!  Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!
Kids:	 Yay!
Mr. Krabs:	 Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties.  Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.
Kids:	 We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby!
SpongeBob:	  Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.
SpongeBob:	 Stall 'em? How do I do that?
Mr. Krabs:	 I don't know. Be entertaining. 
SpongeBob:	  Hey, kids!
Monroe:	 You're not Krabby the Clown.
SpongeBob:	 No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!
Tyler:	 Lame.
SpongeBob:	 Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles? 
Monroe:	 No.
SpongeBob:	 Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?
Tyler:	 Still lame. 
SpongeBob:	  Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh.
Kids:	 You stink! Bring on the clown!
SpongeBob:	 Okay, uh... and now for a finale!  Oops.
Kids:	 Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!
SpongeBob:	  My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey kids, check this out. 
Kids:	 Woo-hoo!
SpongeBob:	 I got 'em right where I want 'em. 
Kids:	 Woo-hoo! Yeah!
SpongeBob:	 
Kids:	 Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!  Yeah, woo!  Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!
SpongeBob:	 
Kids:	 
SpongeBob:	  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Kids:	 Yay!  Yeah! 
SpongeBob:	 Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.
Mr. Krabs:	 Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?
SpongeBob:	 The kids are using them as... boomerangs. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!
SpongeBob:	 What are we gonna do?
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!
SpongeBob:	  Really? He's here?  Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
Mr. Krabs:	 Get out there and tell 'em!
SpongeBob:	  Listen everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!
Kids:	 Yay!
SpongeBob:	 Who do you want?
Kids:	 Krabby!
SpongeBob:	 When do you want him?
Kids:	 Now! Krabby, Krabby, Krabby!  Krabby! Hooray!
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?
Kids and SpongeBob:	 Yay!
Mr. Krabs:	 All right, here you go!  Hey kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties!  Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!
SpongeBob:	 I'll say you have.
SpongeBob:	  How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, I ain't cheap!  Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.
SpongeBob:	 But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?
Mr. Krabs:	  The children? I don't care about the children.  I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose.  Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest. 
Kid:	 Ahem.
Mr. Krabs:	 Huh?  Oh, hey kids.  Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.
Monroe:	 Get him! 
SpongeBob:	  I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.
Squidward:	 You mean this morning?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah. 
Monroe:	 Come on outside, Mr. SquarePants. It's a summer miracle!
Kids:	  Yay! Hooray!
SpongeBob:	 Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.
Kids:	 Hooray! 
SpongeBob:	 Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.
Mr. Krabs:	  Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff!  No! Not that green stuff!  Noooooooooo!
