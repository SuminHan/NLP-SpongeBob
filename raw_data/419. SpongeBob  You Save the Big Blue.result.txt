Johnny:	 And now a special message from SpongeBob SquarePants
SpongeBob:	 Dee, dee, doo, doo... Here is some for you. And here is a little for you. And, that should do it for today.  PATRICK IS WASTING WATER! 
Patrick:	  Hey, SpongeBob! What's up?
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, did you know you left this hose on?
Patrick:	 Yeah, I was leaving under watering my plant.
SpongeBob:	 Well, leaving a hose running can waste  thousands of gallons of water per month.
Patrick:	 Really?!  How many gallons are wasting when we leave a sinking shower running?
Patrick:	 Now what, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Now, we put this captured water to good use.
Mrs. Puff:	  Thanks for watering my flowers, boys.
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 Sure thing, Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob:	 See Patrick, saving a little water, goes a long way.
Johnny:	 For more ways SpongeBob and you can save the Big Blue go to nick.com/biggreenhelp.
