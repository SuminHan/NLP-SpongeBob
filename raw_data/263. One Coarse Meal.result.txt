Mr. Krabs:	  Ahh, that's the stuff.  Hey, something don't smell right. SpongeBob! Hey, what are you burning out here, boy?
SpongeBob:	  Hmm... I'd say a hydrated explosive.
Mr. Krabs:	 Explosive!? 
Plankton:	 Ha ha ha ha! Enjoy, Eugene! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Plankton! I just had that roof redone last week!
Plankton:	 You will be re-re-doing it when I'm through with you!
Mr. Krabs:	 Ready for instant?  Fire!  Take cover!  Oh, ha, ha, it didn't blow up another dud, Plankton.
Plankton:	 Another dud huh? 
Mr Krabs:	 Oh, you're playing with fire now, Plankton!
Plankton:	 No need to get worked up with this Krabs, just give me the secret formula and off I go.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well you ain't getting it.
Plankton:	 Well I constrict you to reconsider. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, go jump off a plank.
Plankton:	 Oh well, I have other ways of getting it when I need where is the formula Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Ha ha ha ha!
Plankton:	 Still not going to talk 'ay' Krabs?  OK Krabs, I see you're still not going to crack but I don't think your underling is of the same metal.
SpongeBob:	 I'll never talk.
Plankton:	 Well, we'll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that.
SpongeBob:	 OK, OK! but I don't how to get into the safe behind the painting in Mr. Krabs' office that houses the secret formula! He won't let me near it!
Plankton:	 Clever, behind the painting ay Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 Errrrrrrr...
Plankton:	  Say what am I smelling? you got something burning?
SpongeBob:	  Smells like blubber to me.
Plankton:	 Bl bl blubber?
Pearl:	 Daddy!
Plankton:	 Ahhhhh! Call off your daughter Krabs! Call her off!
Mr. Krabs:	 She's a big girl Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, And you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today.
Plankton:	 Stay back whale! I'm pippy to what you do to organisms like me. I've seen those documentaries! 
Pearl:	 Did he just go into the freezer?
Plankton:	  Don't say it!
Pearl:	 I prefer salad over Plankton anyway.
Mr. Krabs:	 Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales?  Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my Formular now get us out of this trap.
Pearl:	 Mall money.
Mr. Krabs:	 Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day. . Pearl, why don't you swing to the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a little scare?
Pearl:	 Double my mall money!
Mr. Krabs:	  Alright, SpongeBob. It's your turn!
SpongeBob:	 Here you go, Pearl. Buy something pretty.
Pearl:	 Hey, this isn't money!
SpongeBob:	 No, it's even better! It's the money Mr. Krabs pays  with.  Mr. Krabs' Wacky Bucks!
Mr. Krabs:	  It's all catching up to me...  Please, Pearl?
Pearl:	 No way! The Chum Bucket is, like, totally gross!
Mr. Krabs:	 Hmmm... in that case, I'll need to borrow one of your dressers.
SpongeBob & Pearl:	 Hummina-hunh?/Huh?!
Plankton:	 
Karen:	 My triumphant husband returns. How'd you fail this time?
Plankton:	 Krabs had a whale!
Karen:	 You mean his big, scary, teenage daughter?
Plankton:	 I hear that mocking tone in your voice Karen, and I don't appreciate it! Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?
Karen:	 OK When you take a break from your delusional paranoia, the trash needs some attention. It's ripened.
Pearl/Krabs:	  I'm hungry!
Plankton:	  That should keep her out!
Pearl/Krabs:	  I want Plankton meat!
Plankton:	 Holy, protozoa!  Karen! she's here! She got in!
Karen:	 What are you talking about?
Plankton:	 There's a whale in the laboratory!
Karen:	 Are you out of your mind?
Plankton:	 See for yourself!
Karen:	  No whale in here.
Plankton:	 I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!
Karen:	 Oh that's enough Plankton! If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to more permanent primary functions. 
Plankton:	 Karen! Karen--!
Karen:	 I'm not listening! Hm hm hm!
Narrator:	 16 Paranoia Filled Days Later...
Karen:	  Plankton, your dinner is ready. Plankton, can you hear me?
Plankton:	 Yes, Karen. I can hear you. Could you please bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me. 
Pearl/Krabs:	 
Plankton:	  Hey! Get me out of here! 
Grand-Dad:	 Hey Plankton! Glad you could join the rest of the family!
Plankton:	 Grand-Dad?
Grand-Dad:	 Yep, and you're pretty brave standing in that there gastric acid.
Plankton:	 Gastric acid?  No!  I can't take it! Oh, this is driving me crazy! 
Pearl/Krabs:	 
Plankton:	  What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale!  That's it. I'm done. The 4:15 bus should be here any time now.
SpongeBob:	 Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?
Plankton:	 Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?
SpongeBob:	 I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature.
Plankton:	 Forget it kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.
SpongeBob:	 Okay!
Mr. Krabs:	  Goodbye, Pipsqueak!
SpongeBob:	 Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn.
Mr. Krabs:	 Really? He's a mess! 
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are both sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?
Mr. Krabs:	 May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?
SpongeBob:	 No need to remind me, sir. I've broken Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll fix this.
Plankton:	  Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!
SpongeBob:	 Hi, Plankton.
Plankton:	 What, do you have mud in your ears? Take a hike!
SpongeBob:	 Yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat NOT, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab.
Plankton:	 What difference does it make? There's no point ever since I've been tortured by that blasted whale.
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry. Everyone has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is... 
Plankton:	 Really?
SpongeBob:	 Mmm Hmm, and guess what else?  that was Mr. Krabs in whale suit that you've been scared of.
Plankton:	 So, you're saying that this whole time it was Krabs masquerading as a whale!?  Why that conniving bottomfeeder!
SpongeBob:	 But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such, innocuous information, would you?
Plankton:	 No, of course not.
SpongeBob:	 Well, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!
Plankton:	 No, no. Thank YOU! 
Mr. Krabs:	 This is almost too fun!  Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!
Plankton:	 Oh, is that so.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes.  Boo!
Plankton:	 You don't scare me, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean...  I'm Pearl, not Krabs.
Plankton:	 The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!
Mr. Krabs:	 Secret fear?  What are you talkin' about?
Plankton:	 See for yourself.  Enjoy the show! 
Mr. Krabs:	 No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!
Plankton:	 Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, doesn't it scaredy pants? I feel wonderful!
SpongeBob:	 Um, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug.
Plankton:	 Why?
SpongeBob:	 Because a hungry pod of whales have just arrived for its early feeding. 
Plankton:	  Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Whew! You really redeemed yourself boy!  Okay, you're beginning to creep me out.
