SpongeBob:	  Ah, I tell you Gary, there is nothing better on a sunny day than a fresh walk.
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 What's the matter, pal? Walking too fast for ya?
SpongeBob:	 Huh? What is it, boy? Is someone in danger?
SpongeBob:	 Aww. Come here, little fella. I won't hurt ya.
SpongeBob:	 Aww. I'm gonna called you, Señor Poopus. Good job, Gary. Let's get him home so he can eat. He's almost all shell.
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Boy, Señor Poopus sure is hungry.
SpongeBob:	 Aww. He wants to play.
Patrick:	 Ha. Whatcha doing, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Gary found this stray snail and I'm nursing him back to health.
Patrick:	 Huh. Well, what about those baby snails?
Patrick:	 They're over here.
SpongeBob:	 Aww. So tiny and hungry. They have nobody to take care of them. I'm gonna take 'em home and feed 'em.
Patrick:	 Feed 'em to who?
SpongeBob:	 It is important to keep baby snails warm at all times.
Patrick:	 My mouth is warm.
SpongeBob:	 Uh, good suggestion, Patrick. But I got this.
Patrick:	 Oh.
SpongeBob:	 There we go.
SpongeBob:	 Uh-huh. Perfect temperature. Time to eat my little snaily poos.
SpongeBob:	 Eat up, you little cuties.
Patrick:	 So... I guess I'll be going then.
SpongeBob:	 Huh? What? Did you guys lose your bottle?
SpongeBob:	 Huh?
SpongeBob:	 Oh! You must be the snail mom.
Patrick:	 Hey, SpongeBob! This guy found this snail in his garden and he didn't know what to do. So, I told him how you take care of snails.
Frankie Billy:	 Thanks, pal. You're a lifesaver.
Patrick:	 That's a pretty good thing I thought of. Huh? Well...
SpongeBob:	 I'll call you...
SpongeBob:	 Dani.
SpongeBob:	 Oh. Uh, excuse me. Pardon me. Uh, just a minute!
Nat Peterson:	 Thanks, Snailguy!
SpongeBob:	 Three bags of snail chow. Four bags of snail litter.
Sadie:	 Thanks, Snailguy!
SpongeBob:	 Uh, you're welcome?
SpongeBob:	 Ok, would you guys just relax? You're all gonna get fed. Dani, keep out of Walter's dish. Obulax, what are you doing? Cheryl, Henry, no fighting.
SpongeBob:	 Geez, my pants are getting ruined and my head is sticky. I gotta do something about that.
Mr. Krabs:	 Squidward, why aren't you taking orders from these good people?
Squidward:	 I would, but what's the point? There's no one to make the food.
Mr. Krabs:	  What?! Where's SpongeBob?
Squidward:	 Let me think. No idea.
Mr. Krabs:	 Then you'll have to do SpongeBob's job too!
Squidward:	 I can't do that!
Mr. Krabs:	 Of course you can. Any idiot can do it. Now, get to work! I'm gonna go find SpongeBob!
Squidward:	 Alright, alright! Calm down, everybody! I'm here to take your order!
SpongeBob:	 Yes?
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh, excuse me, me lovely. Maybe I've got the wrong house here. But I can't say I'm disappointed. I was thinkin' of me old matey SpongeBob...
SpongeBob:	 Oh, hey, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	  SpongeBob? That's you, boy? Why aren't you at work? And why are you all dressed up like a nanny puppet subsea hooligowl?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. But I'm so busy taking care of these snails. I'll try to come in tomorrow.
Mr. Krabs:	 You try?! Listen up, me boy-oh! You'll do more than try! You'll...
SpongeBob:	 Down, Vince! You leave Electric Ronnie alone! Mr. Buster, get off that shelf! Nothing today, thank you! Bye, Mr. Krabs!
Squidward:	  I can't believe that I had to do my job's and SpongeBob's. 
French Narrator:	 The next morning...
Squidward:	 What the?  Oh, it's not a cold, it's my allergies.
Squidward:	 Hey, lady!
SpongeBob:	 Huh?
Squidward:	  SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob:	 I don't know. 
Squidward:	 What happened to you? And where did all these snails come from?!
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry. I'm taking very good care of all my snails. 
Squidward:	 I'm not worried about them, I'm worried about me! I'm allergic to snails!
SpongeBob:	 Even Gary? 
Squidward:	 One snail I can handle. Maybe even two or three. But this? Geesh, no way! Just how many snails do you have?
SpongeBob:	 I don't know. Let's count them shall we.

SpongeBob:	 Work? But I've found my life's work. Taking care of wayward snails. 
Squidward:	  That's it!! I'm calling the Bikini Bottom officials so they can deal with it!
Squidward:	 He said like two hundred and fifty-eight! Well, do something about it! That's why I pay taxes!  Oh, my allergies are killing me.
Harold:	 Uh, hello? Hey, man. I'm super hungry. Where's my food, dude?
Squidward:	 Oh, chill your gills! I'll get your food, dude!
Harold:	 Uh, I'm not so super hungry all of a sudden. And also, I'm super not paying!
Mr. Krabs:	 Squidward, have you lost your ever lovin' mind? You cannot be sneezin' all over me Krabby Patties! The customers don't like it. Except for that guy.
Squidward:	 That's it. I'm done.
Mr. Krabs:	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't abandon ship! I have to work all by meself!
Squidward:	  Don't worry, it's not a problem! Any idiot can do it, right?
Mr. Krabs:	 Right.
Patrick:	 Well, if it's snail friends he wants, it's a snail friend he's gonna get.
Patrick:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, another little stray friend. What is your name little fellow?
Patrick:	 It's Patrick! Um, Meow!
SpongeBob:	 I think I'll call you Patrick.
SpongeBob:	 No, no, you dirty boy. You need a bath.
Patrick:	 Meow, no! No, meow!
SpongeBob:	 Uh, hello, police.
Pet Control Police:	 Excuse me, ma'am. But we've had some complaints...
SpongeBob:	  No, thank you, please.  Oh no, Patrick. No outsidies for you. 
Patrick:	 Meow, help! Meow, help! 
Squidward:	 He said, "No, thank you, please"? What does that even mean? I demand that you do something about those snails, now!
Squidward:	 Oh, this has got to stop!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, the bad men want to take you away from me. But I won't let them.
SpongeBob:	  Sanctuary! Sanctuary! Everybody in! Everybody in!
Pet Control Police:	 SpongeBob is behind that fence and he has locked the gate.
Squidward:	  Oh, quit messin' around and just break down the gate!
Bob Barnacle:	  Wait. Maybe there's another way. Get me a bullhorn. I wanna talk to her.
Pet Control Police:	 Him.
Bob Barnacle:	 Oh, right. Him.  SpongeBob, I need you to listen to me!
SpongeBob:	 Hello.
Bob Barnacle:	 SpongeBob, my name is Bob Barnacle. I run the Bob Barnacle Snail Rescue Center. These snails all got loose through a hole in the fence of my snail center. I'm here to help the snails. I'm here to help you.
SpongeBob:	 Hello.
Bob Barnacle:	 I know that you mean well, but there's only so much one sponge can do. You must be very tired from all your hard work.
Bob Barnacle:	 My center has all the space and staff that a snail needs. They'll be well taken care of.
Bob Barnacle:	 I promise. The snails will be happy.
Bob Barnacle:	 Esmerelda!
SpongeBob:	 Esmerelda?
Bob Barnacle:	 Yes, that's her name! What did you call her?
SpongeBob:	  Señor Poopus. 
SpongeBob:	 So long! I'm gonna miss you guys. Especially you, Señor Poopus.  I mean Señorita Esmerelda.
Bob Barnacle:	 You did the right thing. You can visit the snail center anytime.
SpongeBob:	 Thanks, Bob. We will. But I'm going back to being a one snail guy. That's the way I like it.
Gary:	 Meow.
Bob Barnacle:	 Don't forget to get your pet spayed or neutered.
Patrick:	 Bye, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Bye, Patrick.
SpongeBob:	  Patrick! Patrick!  Don't worry! I'm going to adopt you!
