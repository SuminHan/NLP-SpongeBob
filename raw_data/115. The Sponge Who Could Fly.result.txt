French Narrator:	 Last week, a never-before-seen episode of SpongeBob SquarePants was discovered under a desk at Nickelodeon Studios.  Now all the world is waiting in fevered anticipation to watch...  the SpongeBob SquarePants Lost Episode!  Now, to present the Lost Episode, from Encino, California, the president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate! 
Potty:	 Patchy! Patchy! The kids are here. 
Patchy:	 Wah!  Hot! Hot! Hot! Potty, don't you know this is Patchy private time?  Oh, hello! Dahh!  What are you all doing here?
Potty:	 They're here to see the lost episode. Brawk!
Patchy:	 But I haven't got the lost episode because I... well, I lost it! 
Children:	  No, Patchy! Please! Don't say that, Patchy! Please!
Patchy:	 But it is! It's lost and I have no idea where it is, so it's best if you forget all about old SpongeBob. 
French Narrator:	 Remembering SpongeBob. 
Patchy:	 I don't believe I lost the Lost Episode.  I never lose anything.
Potty:	 What about your leg?
Patchy:	 Well, yeah, but...
Potty:	 And your eye.
Patchy:	 Well, the eye, I...
Potty:	 And your hand.
Patchy:	 And the h... oh, get out of here you blasted bird!  Hmm... if only I had a map to tell me where the Lost Episode is. 
Potty:	 What is it? Brawk!
Patchy:	 Hey... it's a map! It's a map to the Lost Episode of SpongeBob I lost!
Potty:	 It's a dream come true!
Patchy:	  We gotta go find it, Potty!  Oh, first I'll need me treasure hunting leg.  Come on, Potty! Ah! Times a-wastin'! 
Potty:	 Brawk!
Patchy:	  Ten paces past Mrs. Johnson's house. 
Mrs. Johnson:	 Would you boys like some cookies?
Patchy:	 Put 'em in a doggie bag, Mrs. Johnson. Can't right now, we're on a treasure hunt. 
Mrs. Johnson:	 Okay, don't catch a cold.
Patchy:	 Walk five fathoms past Don's Import Store and Delicatessen.  Half a league to the forked tree.  Oh!  Now all that's left is... Huh?! The seven trials of monkey lagoon?!  Merciful Neptune. Only for SpongeBob. Only for SpongeBob!  Whoa!  Whoa! Whoa!  Ow!  Ahh... Ahh... Ah!  We made it! We survived the trials! Oh, I'm really gonna dig this lost episode!  Dig it, get it? 
Potty:	  You stink!
Patchy:	 And I just got out of the shower.  Hey Potty, I think I hit something.  Clever... bury your treasure above the surface.
Potty:	 Brawk!
Patchy:	  This is it!  I don't know what it means either.  But I got what I came for! Come on Potty, time's a-wastin'.  Yeah! Popcorn.  Soda.  Pickled garlic!  Potty, hit the remote!
Potty:	  Brawk! 
Patchy:	  This is gonna be great!  I can't believe it. More SpongeBob!  This is so exciting!  Here it comes!
Potty:	 Brawk! Pipe down!
Patchy:	 That's it? That's the Lost Episode? That was just a bunch of cheap walk cycles!
Potty:	 What a rip!
Patchy:	 Grrrrr...  SpongeBob betrayed us?!  I'm sorry I ever started this stupid fan club in the first place!  I'm gonna get rid of all my SpongeBob stuff! All of it! All of it!  All of it!  I'm gonna run away, that's what I'll do! Run away! 
Potty:	 Sheesh, what a hothead!
Announcer:	  And now, the real Lost Episode!
Potty:	 Brawk! Patchy, come back! There's more!
Patchy:	  Really?  Hooray! Let's watch!
French Narrator:	 Here we see the proud jellyfish hunter.  He stands motionless to lure the jellyfish into a false sense of security.  And when his prey ventures to close, he springs into action.
SpongeBob:	  Huh?   Ooh!  Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish.  Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty.  ♪If only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.♪  ♪I would fly so very high and touch the sky.♪  ♪And never have to ask why it is that I can't fly♪  Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants. 
Grandpa SquarePants:	 If we were meant to fly, we'd have propellers on our heads or jet engines on our backs. 
SpongeBob:	  I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine! 
Patrick:	 What's that contraption, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 That, Patrick, is a flying machine.
Patrick:	 
SpongeBob:	 What's so funny?
Patrick:	 Well, it's like my grandpa used to say. 
Grandpa SquarePants:	 If we were meant to fly, uh... hey, I'm not your grandfather! 
SpongeBob:	 Well, here I go, Patrick!  I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check!  Landing gear...  check! Complimentary peanuts...  check-a-roo.  Ready for takeoff! 
Patrick:	 You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!
SpongeBob:	 Don't remind me.
Jenkins:	  I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines! Now git! 
Patrick:	 We better do what he says. He knows how to grow food! 
SpongeBob:	 Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders...  This one's gonna fly!  I can feel it. Ready, Patrick?
Patrick:	  Ready!
SpongeBob:	  It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm...  falling!  Ooh! 
SpongeBob:	 This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly! 
Patrick:	 Oh boy, a birthday party!
SpongeBob:	  No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three.  All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and...  Huh?  Well, back to the drawing board.
Patrick:	 Can we have the cake now?  Happy, happy birthday to you! 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, get ready to say "Eureka!"
Patrick:	 Okay!
SpongeBob:	 Go!  It's working! I'm flying! 
Cap Fish:	 Hey! Look at that guy tied to a kite!
Fred:	 Why's he doing that?
Nancy:	 Oh my goodness...
Fred:	 Why's he doing that?
Cap Fish:	 He'll fall and break his...
Nancy:	 Can you see from up there?
SpongeBob:	 Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you.  D'oh!  Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick!  Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite.
Vendor:	 Hey... I know you. Yeah, from today's paper! 
SpongeBob:	 "Local nutcase tries to fly"?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs too!
Vendor:	 No they didn't.
SpongeBob:	  You'll see. 
Monroe:	 Look mom, it's the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom.
Mable:	 Wow! I wonder why he's still using his legs.
Monroe:	 Come on, Bird Man. Flap your wings and fly! 
Cap Fish:	 Hey, Bird Man, going to check on your eggs?
Nancy:	 Maybe he's looking for a statue to poop on.
Fred:	 
SpongeBob:	 Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams! 
Mother #2:	 You think you're the only one with unfulfilled dreams?
Stubble Fish:	 I was supposed to be a concert pianist... until I realized I didn't have any fingers. 
Nat:	 We all had dreams.
Nancy:	 What makes you so special? 
Mob:	 Let's get him!
SpongeBob:	  Huh? 
Nat:	 Good riddance, dreamer!
SpongeBob:	  Ooh!  Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh!  I guess I spoke too soon.
French Narrator:	 [television version only]  Will SpongeBob learn to fly? Stay tuned.
