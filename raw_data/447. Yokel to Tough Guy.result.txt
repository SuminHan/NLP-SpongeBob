Narrator:	 With just a couple minor adjustments, anyone can go from yokel to tough guy!
SpongeBuck:	 Wow, even me?
Narrator:	 Even you. 
SpongeBuck:	 I'm ready to be tough.
Narrator:	 Good, 'cause this city-slicker necktie has got to go.  And this hat...ridiculous.  Now all you need is some uncut facial hair , a handlebar mustache , a scar ...
SpongeBuck:	 Ow!
Narrator:	 ...tough guy hat , gloves , bandanna , boots , and lastly that ol' tough guy scowl .
SpongeBuck:	 Ain't nobody gonna mess with me now.
Pecos Patrick:	  What'd you say?
SpongeBuck:	  Please don't hurt me!
