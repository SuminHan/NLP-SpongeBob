SpongeBob:	 In Australia, we visited the Sydney Aquarium where some of the ocean's most dangerous criminals are locked up and came with an idea for a hit TV show, "Sponge is the New Black".
Patrick:	 If you're interested, have your people talk to our people.
SpongeBob:	 We had so much fun at the Luna Park in Melbourne!
Patrick:	 My favorite ride was the Devil's Drop!
SpongeBob:	 Not me. I was so scared, I merely soaked my sponge.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Bondi Beach. That's more my style. Hello, beautiful!
Patrick:	 Hello, SpongeBob!
