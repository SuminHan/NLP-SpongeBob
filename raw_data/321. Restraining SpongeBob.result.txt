Squidward:	 What the...?  SpongeBob, do you mind!?
SpongeBob:	 Oh! Hey, Squidward. What are you doing?
Squidward:	  What am I doing!? What are  doing!?
SpongeBob:	 I am sharpening my trusty spatula. Speaking of which, are you going to stick around for morning fry-cook calisthenics?
Squidward:	 Cala-what?
SpongeBob:	 Walking to work, huh, Squidward?
Squidward:	 Go away.
SpongeBob:	 Can I walk with you?
Squidward:	 No.
SpongeBob:	 Please?
Squidward:	 No.  I said  I will not walk to work with yo--! 
SpongeBob:	 Okay. Maybe tomorrow, then!
Customer:	 I'll have 2 Krabby Patties.
Squidward:	 Okay. And would you like cheese on-- 
Customer:	 Do you...need a break or something?
Squidward:	  What? Oh, no! Wha--? No-ho, that was not me, I swear.  SpongeBob!  It's empty!  See empty!
SpongeBob:	 Wow, Squidward, how do you know that? 
Squidward:	 Well let's see, maybe 'cause I have a brain. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh-uh, Squidward, the grill is on.
Squidward:	 Oh, really? And do you think that I don't know that this grill is... 
SpongeBob:	 I gotta do something.  Okay, Squidward, this should help.  Don't worry, Squidward, I'll catch you.  I can fix this.  This time I got ya. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Me soda machine!!! 
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, can you hear me? How many fingers am I...  Squidward? 
Mr. Krabs:	 You really sent him over the edge this time.
SpongeBob:	 Technically, I drove him up the wall.
Narrator:	 One shift later...
Squidward:	 Oh, SpongeBob, I got a present for you.
SpongeBob:	 A present? For me?
Squidward:	 Now now. Calm down. I've should've given this to you a long time ago!
SpongeBob:	 Wow Squidward! My very own... restraining order. Uh...what is that?
Squidward:	 Perhaps my lawyers should explain 
Harry:	 We are the law offices of Harry, Combover, and Bald! Specializing in restraining order logical law and here to tell one Mr. Squarepants...
Harry, Combover, & Bald:	 YOU'VE BEEN SERVED!
Spongebob:	 Served? I don't understand. Squidward, what is these guys- 
Bald:	 Per paragraph 3 of the restraining order, you may no longer speak to our client  Likewise, you may not come within 15 feet of Mr. Squidward at any time. Any infractions of these statues will result in SERIOUS JAIL TIME!
SpongeBob:	 Can you make Krabby Patties for loyal Krusty Krab patrons during "serious jail time"?
Bald:	 Huh? 
Squidward:	 And. 
Bald:	 No.
SpongeBob:	  NO! I DON'T WANNA GO!
Combover:	 Well then, follow the guidelines we've explain and you won't have to.
SpongeBob:	 Uh, sirs? If I can't speak to or get within 15 feet of Squidward, how are we going to get anything done around here?
Harry, Combover, and Bald:	 THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM. 
SpongeBob:	  Hmm... Here we go! 3 Krabby Patties, 2 large Kelpy Colas, and 3 fries ready to be served.  Hmm?  Oops!  Sorry about that Mr. Krabs! It's just so hard to get this food to Squidward without violating this restraining order. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Let me see that!  Thank you! Look boy, I don't know what in coral cabins what a restraining order is, but I do know whatever's going on here clearly ain't working. Now I want this ship sailing smoothly! On the double! Or I'll be forced to remove more gold stars from your employee performance chart! 
SpongeBob:	  Think SpongeBob think! Gasp! I got it!
Patrick:	  Hehe.
Squidward:	  Oh if I ignore it, maybe it will go away.
Patrick:	  Hehe.
Squidward:	 I thought not  Oh-kay Patrick. WHAT? WHAT?! WHAT!
Patrick:	  Notice anything...  Different? Huh? Huh? A hint! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Patrick! I am not NOT paying you to stand around and play guess what the idiot's thinking with Squidward! Get back to work!
Squidward:	 Yeah Patrick! Get back to...WHAT?!? WORK?!? Oh no! NO! NO! NO! Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 Why all the shivering of the timbers Mr. Squidward?
Squidward:	 Mr. Krabs! This will not stand!

Squidward:	 What?

Squidward:	  Give me that restraining order!
SpongeBob:	 AH!
Squidward:	 Alright, right, let's look at this.

Patrick:	  Squidward?  Did you know the monster was Squidward? Well when were you going to tell me?
SpongeBob:	  I violated the restraining order! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Squidward:	 Quit bellyaching and hand me a pen.
SpongeBob:	  Here you go. 
Squidward:	 Stop the waterworks! You're not going to jail.
SpongeBob:	 I'm not?
