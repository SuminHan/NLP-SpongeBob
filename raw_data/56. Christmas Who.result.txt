Narrator:	 And now, direct from Encino, America's favorite pirate and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate. 
Patchy:	  Yo ho ho, yo ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho ho.  Oh! Hi.  I'm Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club!  Hey, that's better! 
Potty:	  Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Patchy:	 That's right, Potty! It is Christmas.  And there ain't nothing better in the seven seas than a Bikini Bottom Christmas. It sure is a magical time of year.  Why, I'll bet old SpongeBob is gearing up for Santa Claus right now! 
SpongeBob:	 I sure am!  I'm ready! 
Patchy:	 Not bad for a creature with no vertebrae.  And I'm sure our pal Patrick is doing his share of the decorating.  I too am also preparing for Christmas.  Hmm, unbaked cookie dough!  Mmm...
Potty:	  Potty want cookie dough!  Cookie! 
Patchy:	 Potty! No! 
Potty:	 Cookie! 
Patchy:	 Get out of here!
Potty:	 Cookie!
Patchy:	 Potty!
Potty:	  Give us a lick!
Patchy:	 Back off, you flying freak! 
Potty:	  Clarify please.
Patchy:	  This here cookie dough is for the children, not for pesky parrots.  What's that? Three bells! Well, we all know what three bells means!
Children:	  Free ice cream! 
Patchy:	 No, you silly livers!  No!
Potty:	  Man overboard? 
Patchy:	 You, I'm ignoring.  No, it means it's time to open fan letters! 
Potty:	  Here you go! 
Patchy:	 Thank you, Potty.  Yeah. Okay Potty, thank you!  Come on, give it, you birdbrain!  Quiet, infernal bird!  Hmm.  This letter comes to us from...
Fish Head:	  Name and address withheld! 
Patchy:	 And he writes, "Dear SpongeBob, I am ten years old, and I was wondering if you like Christmas as much as I do. Sincerely yours..."
Fish Head:	  Name and address withheld! 
Patchy:	 A very good question. But you know they didn't always celebrate Christmas in Bikini Bottom.
Potty:	  They didn't?
Patchy:	 No sir, my fine feathered little neck pain.  There was a time when no one had even heard of Christmas in Bikini Bottom.  Hey! Who wants to hear the story of SpongeBob's very first Christmas?  Potty?!  You ate all me cookie dough! 
Potty:	 Squ-ouch! 
Patchy:	 Oh well! On with the show!
SpongeBob:	  Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move. 
SpongeBob:	 What diabolical act is she committing now?  Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire!  Huh? So I guess there's no fire?
Sandy:	 What in the name of the Alamo is wrong with you, SpongeBob? Ain't you never seen a Christmas tree before?
SpongeBob:	 Christmas who?
Sandy:	 What?! Y'all never heard of Christmas?
SpongeBob:	 Is she a friend from Texas?
Sandy:	  No. I can't believe you haven't heard of...  ...Christmas.
SpongeBob:	 Tell me more about this...  ..."Christmas".
Patchy:	 And so, Sandy wove the magical tale of gumdrops and pennywhistles. She told of toy-making elves and flying reindeer. But best of all, she told of the one they call, Santa Claus.
SpongeBob:	 And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake.
Squidward:	 Yawn.
SpongeBob:	 But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you.
Patrick:	 Just like a genie. (laughs)
Mr. Krabs:	 I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine.
SpongeBob:	 That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs.  Here you go! You can get started on your letter.
Squidward:	 I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts.
Patrick:	 Like a genie. (Laughs)
Mr. Krabs:	 Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus.
Squidward:	 Oh, brother.
Patrick:	 Yeah.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, who's next?
Patrick:	 Ooh, ooh, me, me!
Squidward:	 Ooh.
SpongeBob:	 Here you go, Patrick.
Patrick:	 There's no words on this paper.
SpongeBob:	 Not yet.
Patrick:	 Yippee! A writing stick.
SpongeBob:	 C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter.
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter. 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one?
SpongeBob:	 Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid...  ...ward.
Patrick:	 Uhh, SpongeBob...  Thanks.  Dear Sant...  D'oh! Not again.
SpongeBob:	 Here, Patrick, watch me. Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish.  Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole!
Patrick:	 Santa! Haha. Where's Santa?
SpongeBob:	 Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve.
Mr. Krabs:	 Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, my letter, is ready to go.
SpongeBob:	 Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for?
Mr. Krabs:	 A pony.
SpongeBob:	 Really?
Mr. Krabs:	 With saddle bags full of money! 
Patrick:	 Here you go, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 What did you wish for, Patrick?
Patrick:	 Another piece of paper. 
SpongeBob:	 And what did you wish for, little girl?
Susie:	 Front teeth.
Cowboy:	 I could use a new hat.
Jennifer-Millie:	 I need a new hairstyle.
Lonnie:	 How about a glass of water for my teeth.
Squidward:	 Excuse me, coming through, out of the way.
SpongeBob:	 Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?
Squidward:	 My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth.
SpongeBob:	 Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival.
Everyone:	 Hooray!

Patchy:	 Is Squidward right? Can there be a Christmas under the sea? Stay tuned!  It's about time you got back! Now I can finish me story! So, SpongeBob was sending the last of the letters to Santa...
Martin:	 I hope he can read Portuguese.
SpongeBob:	 Ahh, that's the last letter. Huh? Wait! Squidward hasn't written his letter yet!  Squidward! Hurry! Squidward, Squidward! Hurry! 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Squidward. I'll help you get started.  Dear Santa Claus...
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, forget it.
SpongeBob:	 Right, too formal. Hi Santa...
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, no.
SpongeBob:	 Howdy, Claus?
Squidward:	  I'm not writing a letter to a figment of your imagination.
SpongeBob:	 But, Squidward, when Santa comes, you'll be the only one without a gift.
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, how many times do I have to say it? I don't believe in Santa Claus!
SpongeBob:	 C’mon, Squid, all you have to do is write a letter. What have you got to lose?
Squidward:	 My self-respect. My sanity. My lunch. 
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, c'mon. 
Citizens:	 C’mon, Squidward. Don't be a party pooper. C'mon out.
Squidward:	  Santa Claus is a big phony! SpongeBob has got you all fooled.
SpongeBob:	 C'mon, Squidward. C'mon!

Citizens:	 Oh, c'mon. Enough of this. 
Fred:	 Thanks for the lies, Mr. Fairytale! Let's go waste our time somewhere else.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, guys, where's your Christmas Spirit? He's just running late.
Patrick:	 He probably just stopped for a snack! Fat guys get hungry right?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah! 
Patrick:	 Never trust a genie. 
Squidward:	  Ahh, morning already? Oh, boy!  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Wait. Oh, I see a great Christmas photo op. Could you move in a little? Say Santa Claus.
SpongeBob:	  Santa Claus. 
Squidward:	 Aww, our first Christmas. This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas. The first Christmas is this Christmas.  Cause it feels like the first Christmas to me. 
SpongeBob:	 You were right, Squidward. This is a stupid holiday.  I still want you to have this.
Squidward:	 What? What's this?
SpongeBob:	 A present. I made it for you so you wouldn't be left out when... Santa came! "[cries some more]"
Squidward:	 Oh, gee, I, uh, you know I...
SpongeBob:	 You're welcome. "[sadly walks off and cries]"
Squidward:	 SpongeBob? He made me a present? It's probably a jellyfish net, or an old Krabby patty, or...  his favorite underpants. Haha.  Why, it looks like a clarinet.  It smells like one, too. Handcrafted on driftwood. And it's even got my name on it.  What's this?  Wow. This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten. Oh, I feel like a... I feel like a... I feel like a...  big jerk. What have I done to poor SpongeBob? Uh, hey, SpongeBob? I... SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob:	 I guess I won't be needing this.  That's better. 
Squidward:	 Poor little guy. All he wanted was to spread a little joy.
SpongeBob:	 I better get this stuff off of Squid's house.
Squidward:	 Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!
SpongeBob:	 Huh? Hello? Who's there? Huh? Hello?
Squidward:	 Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!
SpongeBob:	 Hello? Yes. Who's there? Huh? Hello? Show yourself. Yoo-hoo. Hello? Who is it? Huh?
Squidward:	 Up here you dunce.  I mean, uh, Merry Christmas little boy.
SpongeBob:	  C-c-could it be?
Squidward:	 Yes, it is I, Santa Claus. Ho, ho, ho... 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, you're S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...  S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...  S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...
Squidward:	 Hey, uh, kid, take it easy.
SpongeBob:	 S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... ta... 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob? SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob:	 S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...
Squidward:	 Don't do that again.
SpongeBob:	 I knew you'd make it, Santa. Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly.
Squidward:	 Well, that, um, is a result of, uh, undersea pressure on my body.
SpongeBob:	 Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine?
Squidward:	 Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter bunny.
SpongeBob:	 And what about that nose?  I knew you were suppose to have a big one but, that things gigantic. 
Squidward:	 Alright! I'm Santa.
SpongeBob:	  Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.
Squidward:	 I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did.
SpongeBob:	 I did? 
Gary:	 Meow.
Squidward:	 Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over.
Shelly:	 Do you have a present for me, Santa?
Squidward:	 Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really...
SpongeBob:	  Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down.
Squidward:	 Uhh, right, just a second.  C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A box of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect!  There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho!
Shelly:	 Thanks, Santa. 
Squidward:	 That almost felt good.  I didn't... who?
Fred:	 Hey, Santa, where's my present?
Old Man Jenkins:	 And mine!
Abigail-Marge:	 And what about me?
Squidward:	 Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people.  Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. A-ha! A bowl of mashed potatoes for you.
Jennifer-Millie:	 Thank you, Santa. This is just what I wanted.  A new hairstyle.
Squidward:	  Here you go, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Wow.  A wrist watch.
Squidward:	  What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane?  You might as well take the door. It's all that's left.
SpongeBob:	 Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind.  And Santa is... oh, his belly was small but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward...
Squidward:	 Well, at least it's over.  Huh? What's this?
Santa:	 Dear Squidward, thanks for all your help! You've been a real good boy this year. Warm regards, Santa Claus.  Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho. 
Squidward:	 Yup, I'm insane. 
Santa:	 Merry Christmas! 
Patchy:	 Dee dee, dee dee dee dee.  Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island!  Presents, ahoy!  Hooray!  Oh, a storm!  Yay! I mean yikes!  Oh, we're going down!  Trim the sails! Hoist the yardarms! Turn on the Weather Channel! 
Man on Set:	  Patchy!
Patchy:	 Oh, hi kids. Boy, that SpongeBob makes me as jolly as a roger. Well, I hope you enjoyed SpongeBob's Christmas tale. And I hope your Christmas is better than sunken treasure.  Aw... Potty left me a little Christmas present.  Arr, ye old mistletoe. And you know what that means.  Ah, time for somebody to kiss Patchy the Pirate!  Come on, who's it gonna be? Come on! Kiss the captain! 
Potty:	 Give us a kiss! 
Patchy:	 No! No, not you!  No, not you Potty! Get out of here! No, Potty! I don't wanna kiss you! No, we talked about this! Potty! No!
Potty:	 Kissy, kissy!
Narrator:	 Well, it looks like Patchy's pretty busy at the moment, so I'll say it for him. Good night, and happy holidays.
