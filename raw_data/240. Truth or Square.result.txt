Ricky Gervais:	  Ten years ago, an unknown   pirate from Encino began a  decade long obsession  with TV's most beloved  an absorbent sponge. And today,  a mere ten years later, obviously,  ten years ago, I said that,  he has traveled all the way to a far off land known as, "Burbank."  To find Nicktoons Animation Studio  and meet his idol  face to face for the first time  in  ten years...it's ten years ago.  It's ten years ago.  Let's see what happens, yeah.
Patchy the Pirate:	 Oh. Bye Mom. Thanks for the lift.  Hey, kids. Isn't this exiting? I'm here at Nickelodeon, home of SpongeBob SquarePants. And I'm gonna ask him if he'll be my guest of honor on my tenth anniversary TV special.  Come on.  Ahoy.
Security Guard:	  Sir, may I help you?
Patchy:	 Yes. This is Patchy the Pirate for SpongeBob SquarePants. I believe he's expecting me. I sent him over 400 letters...this week.
Security Guard:	 Uh, yes. SpongeBob is not here right now, sir.
Patchy:	 That's okay. I can wait.  SpongeBob?!
Security Guard:	 Sir, please step away from the gate.
Patchy:	 Aw, poop deck. I was hoping I could ask SpongeBob to phone up some of his famous friends so he could ask them to be guests on my show.
Security Guard:	 Uh huh.  Oh. You're here for the Casting Department.
Patchy:	 Yeah.
Security Guard:	 In that case, please step right inside sir.
Patchy:	 Woo! Oh hey, when'll SpongeBob be here? Whe're's he? At lunch?  At an important meeting?
Security Guard:	 I'm not sure, sir.
Patchy:	 Getting his boat waxed?
Security Guard:	  This way, sir.
Patchy:	 What's he really like?
Security Guard:	  This way, sir.
Patchy:	 Does he come in everyday?
Security Guard:	  This way, sir.
Patchy:	 Does he dye his hair?
Security Guard:	  Walk this way, sir.
Patchy:	 Huh?
Security Guard:	 Here you are, sir. Please wait here while you wait.  Can I get you anything, sir?
Gary:	  Meow.  Meow.  Meow. 
SpongeBob:	 Good Morning, Gary!
Gary:	  Meow.
SpongeBob:	 A little overboard? And take a chance at being late for the single most greatest day of my career.  The eleventy-seventh anniversary of the Krusty Krab.  Oh, oh, oh, I think not.  No self-respecting Krusty Krab employee would be late on this day. 
Squidward:	  What the?
Gary:	  Meow, Meow, Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Watch the potty mouth, Gare. Today is a day for gentle reflection. Aw, I remember my first visit to The Krusty Krab.
Harold SquarePants:	 I don't know. This doesn't seem like a family restaurant.
Margaret SquarePants:	 Oh.  Well, what do you think, baby? Should we eat here?  Well, Okay, then.  What would you like?
SpongeBob:	 Krabby Patty!  Yummy!  Good times.  Oh, sorry, Gary, we can reminisce later. I gotta get ready. 
SpongeBob:	 
Patchy:	 Security, more shrimp cocktail in Casting, please. Thank you. 
Devil Potty:	 Look, Patchy, a Rolodex. Why, it's probably full of celebrity phone numbers. You don't need SpongeBob. You can call them yourself. Go on, have a look. Squawk.
Angel Potty:	 That's private property, Patchy. If you get caught looking at it, we'll never get to meet SpongeBob.
Patchy:	 Yeah, good point.
Devil Potty:	 Don't listen to him. You want your TV show to have big-name guests, don't you?
Patchy:	 Yeah. No. I mean...
Devil Potty:	 Then do it.
Angel Potty:	 Don't do it, Patchy.
Devil Potty:	 Come on. Do it! Do it!
Patchy:	 I shall.  Let's see, Dawson, Richard. Rosario. Rosario Dawson! She'll bring a little class to the show.
Rosario Dawson:	 Hello?
Patchy:	 Uh, hello, Rosario.
Rosario Dawson:	 Oh, Goodness.
Patchy:	 It's Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob
Patchy:	  Fan Club. I'm throwing a little TV
Patchy:	 show-tacular, and I need a little celebrity wind in my sail, so to speak.
Rosario Dawson:	 Okay. You need a little mouthwash is what you need.
Patchy:	 I was wondering if you'd like to be my special guest.
Rosario Dawson:	 Are you going to be in the same city?
Patchy:	 Of course, silly. We'll be working closely together all day.
Patchy:	 Well, back to the old Rolodex. Uh, Bo Derek. Bo Diddly. Eddie Deezen. Eddie Deezen?
Eddie Deezen:	 Hey, when do we film?
Security Guard:	 This way, sir.
Patchy:	 Ooh. This will be good. 
Triumph the Insulting Comic Dog:	 Yes?
Patchy:	 Ahoy, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.
Triumph:	 I'm Busy. Hurry up.
Patchy:	 This is Patchy the Pirate.
Triumph:	 Oh. Don't give me that Patchy stuff. Come on, Depp, I know it's you. Drop the pirate thing.
Patchy:	 You know, I do get that a lot, but seriously, it's not Johnny Depp.
Triumph:	 Come on. Who is this? The pirate from the cereal box or the litter box.
Patchy:	 The one from Encino. It's Patchy, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club.
Triumph:	 Oh, the president. Well, your mother must be so proud.
Triumph:	 Listen, Scratchy.
Patchy:	 It's Patchy
Triumph:	 You know, Catchy, maybe you should consider wearing two eye patches. That way, you won't be able to see what's become of your life.
Patchy:	 What?
Triumph:	 So, what are you tell me, what are you selling, besides your dignity and self-respect?
Patchy:	 None of the above. I was wondering if you'd like to be a guest on the big TV special. That I am throwing for SpongeBob.
Triumph:	 Sorry, Poop-Leg Pete. I'm a big star. I don't do basic cable. I'm on a major network. Kind of.
Patchy:	 It would sure mean a lot to be personally if you'd be on my show, Triumph.
Triumph:	 Oh, it would mean a lot. Well, why didn't you say so? That changes everything.
Patchy:	 Oh.
Triumph:	 You know, I'd love to be on your show. I'd love it as much as I love pulling ticks off my butt.
Patchy:	 Well, fine. Who needs you, you filthy mongrel? 
Triumph:	 Okay, Captain Loser. Send me a script.
Patchy:	 Great! So, you'll be on my show?
Triumph:	 Sure, of course. I'm sure that it's a great script. Three, two, one. For me to poop on!
Patchy:	 Oh, yeah, well, I'll have you know, you are not the biggest star to tell me that. Hello? Hello?
Harold:	 Hey, hey. Chill out, buddy. We all want to get into the Krusty Krab as much as you do.
Harold:	 Oh!
Mable-Monica:	 Ah!
Isabelle Fish:	 Ooh!
Sadie:	 What the?
Frankie Billy:	 Hey!
Fred:	 Ah!
Tom:	 Eh!
Shubie:	 Uh!
SpongeBob:	 Sorry, everybody, but Mr. Krabs needs me.  Reporting for duty, sir. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Take a seat, boy.
SpongeBob:	 Happy eleventy-seventh, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs:	  Today's a big a day for The Krusty Krab.  So I want yous to listen up.  It's a perfect opportunity for Plankton to try and steal the Krabby Patty formula. 
Mr. Krabs:	 No. It's a holographic projection of The Krusty Krab. I want you two to watch all the entrances.
Squidward:	 You mean the front door  the back door?
Mr. Krabs:	 Those are just the ones on the surface.  There is an entire network of tunnels and air ducts underground and I want all eyes on the look out!
SpongeBob:	 Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Right. Study the map, stay extra vigilant. Don't fall asleep on the job. That means you, Squidward.
Squidward:	 What? I have never fallen asleep on duty.
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't make me have a flashback.
Squidward:	 All right, point taken.
Mr. Krabs:	 And to help watch out for Plankton, I've hired some  security.
Squidward:	  You hired Patrick?
Mr. Krabs:	 What, you expect me to spend money on a real security guard? You are my first line of defense, Patrick. So, look out for any suspiciorous characters.
Patrick:	  Yes, sir.  Who are you? And Who are you working for?!
Mr. Krabs:	 Plankton doesn't stand a chance.
Plankton:	  It's a conspiracy, I tell you! A thousand and three times I've almost had that recipe, and a thousand and three times I've been launched by that Krabs! He celebrates eleventy-seven years of success,  I'm left with four score and forty fortnights of failure!  I give up, Karen. Krabs has won!
Karen:	  Well, you'll never get the formula with that attitude.  Maybe a thousand and four will be your lucky number.
Plankton:	 Oh, yeah? You try getting launched.
Karen:	 Oh, right, the launchings.  I've got them all on my hard drive.
Mr. Krabs:	 Fore!
Plankton:	 Ow!
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm tired today, Plankton.  You're just gonna have to launch yourself.
Plankton:	 Splat. 
Plankton:	 Karen?!
Karen:	 I'm sorry. That last part always makes me laugh.
Plankton:	 It's just no use!
Karen:	  Today's the  perfect day to steal the recipe. Krabs will be completely distracted by all the festivities. You can do this.
Plankton:	 You really think so?
Karen:	 Of course, I do. Now who's my big man?
Plankton:	 Oh, Karen.
Karen:	 Come on. Come on. Who's my big strong man?
Plankton:	 I am.
Karen:	 That's right. Now get out there and steal that recipe.
Plankton:	  Yes, Ma'am!
Patchy:	 Hey, LeBron, how's the Dribbling?
LeBron James:	 Hey, Patchy, What's up?
Patchy:	 How would you, LeBron James, like to be a guest on the fan clubmongorical special for SpongeBob?
LeBron James:	 I Love SpongeBob, man, but I can't, man. I've got a game today, man.

Tina Fey:	 Hello.
Patchy:	 Ahoy, Tina.
Tina Fey:	 Who is this?
Patchy:	 Patchy... the pirate.
Tina Fey:	 Oh, I don't know any pirates anymore. Are you sure you have the right number?
Patchy:	 Hey, listen, us bad soul sistas have to stick  together, huh?
Tina Fey:	 Sure.
Patchy:	 Great, 'cause I'm throwing a huge telestravaganza for SpongeBob SquarePants and I'd love it if you'd come down and sing a song for us.
Tina Fey:	 I'm not much for singing, but I love SpongeBob. Who else is going to be performing?
Patchy:	 Aren't you the modest one? Well, SpongeBob, for one, will be on the show.
Tina Fey:	 Oh, Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob?
Patchy:	 Who?
Tina Fey:	 Well, you said SpongeBob is going to be on the show.
Patchy:	 That's right. The little sponge is the guest of honor.
Tina Fey:	 But, he's a cartoon, so you mean the guy who does the voice, right?
Patchy:	 Listen, Miss Turner, you let me handle the guests. You stick to your singing and dancing.
Tina Fey:	 Mrs. Turner? Oh, no, this isn't Tina Turner. This is Tina Fey.
Patchy:	 Who?
Patchy:	 Hello? Hello, Tina? You'd better be good to me.

Patchy:	 Doubt it. Who are your guests?
Will Ferrell:	 You name it, we've go it: Hollywood stars, musical people, singers, jugglers, a guy who does things with knifes.  Do you have that,  huh? Who do you have?

Mr. Krabs:	 What? But you are.
SpongeBob:	 I am?  Yay!  Yeah! Yeah!

Patrick:	 A high school diploma?
Mr. Krabs:	 No,  the air duct.  This way boys.  All we have to do is head through this duct.
Squidward:	 Which one? There must be 20 ways to go.
SpongeBob:	 Not to worry, Squidward. I have the entire map memorized.
Mr. Krabs:	  Uh, hmm, uh...
SpongeBob:	  Hurry up, guys, this kind of hurts.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, according to the map, we just go straight, take a right between these three moldy tree stumps, then head towards that kidney-bean shaped pile of gravy.
Squidward:	 That's not the map, you old barnacle. those are  three moles and a birthmark.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh. All right,  then, let's try this one.
Squidward:	  It's this way.
Patrick:	 Here it is.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, what's this?  It's an old Krabby Patty wrapper.  Aah, that takes me back to the good old days.

SpongeBob:	 You know, this reminds me of the time Mr. Krabs confided in me the Krabby Patty recipe. Oh, I don't want to bore you with my silly old stories.
Plankton:	 Oh, you couldn't possibly bore me.
SpongeBob:	 Well, okay. Mr. Krabs called me into his office.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, you've been working here for a while now, so I think I can trust you. It's time I told you.
SpongeBob:	 You mean?
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes. The Krabby Patty formular. Follow me, son.  We need to go where no one will ever hear us.  Ugh. We finally made it.  Quick, get into me office before anyone sees us.
Plankton:	 What? You just went in a circle. Why didn't you just stay in the Krusty Krab?
SpongeBob:	 We wanted to make sure we weren't followed. Then, Mr. Krabs leaned in close and whispered the recipe.
Plankton:	 Yes? Go on.
Mr. Krabs:	 Now, remember, you can never tell another living soul.
Plankton:	  Wait!  Wait! Hold on!
Mr. Krabs:	  What's that?
Plankton:	 My pen is out of ink.  Okay, okay, go ahead.
Mr. Krabs:	 Plankton.  You'll never have get me formula.  Not even in a flashback.
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, if you had never come to Bikini Bottom, this wouldn't be happening. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Squidward, what's with the creepy smile?
Squidward:	 I was just  remembering the world before SpongeBob.
Flowers:	 Morning, Squidward.
Squidward:	 Good Morning, Not SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 But, Squidward, you're glad I moved in. Remember that day.  ah-uh.  Nah.  No. 
Patty Rechid:	 Okay, well, that's every available house in Bikini Bottom. 
Squidward:	 My secret garden is finally done.
Patty Rechid:	 Oh, yeah, I forgot that one.
SpongeBob:	 It's beautiful.  I'll take it.   Hi, neighbor!  I'm SpongeBob SquarePants.  And we're going to be bestest friends.  Hey, Patrick. Guess, who just moved in right next door?
Patrick:	 Neighbor hug!
Crowd:	  We want Krabby Patties! We Want  Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs:	 What's the sound? Customers!
Crowd:	 We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want to spend money!
Harold:	 What do we want?
Crowd:	 Krabby Patties!
Harold:	 What do we welcome?
Crowd:	 To Spend Money!
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, no. All that loose change out there  is driving me wallet mad with money lust.  Poor little guy's starving.  There you go, boy. You're free. Go towards the money boy. Towards the money! 
Dave:	 Hey a wallet!  And there's 50 bucks in it. All right! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey! Oh, no!  What am I going to do?  We gotta get out of here. Now!
SpongeBob:	 Oh. If only Sandy was here. She could help us.
Patrick:	 Oh! Hey, maybe we can use this.  I borrowed it from Sandy's treedome. It might be our way outta here. Shh! Everybody quiet! Hey, Sandy, I got your radio! If you want it back, come and get it! She'll come.
Squidward:	 Oh, give me that.  Snady, come in, Sandy.
Sandy:	  Sandy Cheeks here.  So, it was  you who stole my other radio, Squidward!
Squidward:	 What? No. I'm just-- I
Patrick:	 Sandy's trapped in that box!  Sandy?
SpongeBob:	 Remember the day Sandy and I got married?
Mr. Krabs:	 What?
Squidward:	 No.
Patrick:	 I'm freaking out!
SpongeBob:	 Mm-hmm.
Wedding Officiant:	 Friends, we have gathered here today  to join  these two hearts  in the bonds of love.  SpongeBob, do you take Sandy as your lawfully wedded wife?
SpongeBob:	 I do.
Wedding Officiant:	 And Sandy, do you take SpongeBob as your lawfully wedded husband?
Sandy:	 And how!
Wedding Officiant:	 Well, then, I now pronounce you sponge and squirrel. You may kiss the bride.
Frank (red shirt):	 Boo! You Stink!
Mr. Krabs:	 Worst play I've ever seen.  And a total rip-off!
Fish:	 What has happened to the theater?
Another Fish:	 Lousy Costumes.
Wedding Officiant:	 I didn't know this was a play.
Patchy:	 Well, kids, this was supposed to be the part of the show where SpongeBob and I were gonna watch old outtakes  and rejected scenes and talk about 'em.  But he never showed up! And now I'm stuck in the belly of a whale! Oh, well. We already paid for the airtime, so here they are.  Hello, children. You know, like any great work of art, SpongeBob did not just appear out of nowhere. He started out as a thought.  The he evolved into  a primitive rendering... And along the way  to becoming the sponge we all know and love,  he went through many different changes. And phases and phanges.  And pain can be very painful. For instance,  did you know that SpongeBob was not the first choice to star in the show?  Hard to believe, I know. Watch these opening themes, and you'll see why he was eventually picked.

SpongeBob:	 Happy anniversary, Krusty Krab.
Ricky Gervais:	 Wow, Patchy sure made a mess of things, didn't he? He's not much of a pirate either, really, come to think of it.  That's the problem.  Not like Blackbeard. Whoa, now there was a pirate.  Now Blackbeard  would have been able to get the real A-listers  on his TV special.  Yeah, your Bruce Willises and your Gwyneth Paltrows  and Ricky Gervaises.  Let's not forget him. Brilliant.  He wouldn't even have to shanghai them.  They would have  shown up on set out of respect.  and fear.  Back then, pirates were serious business.  Patchy's kinda  giving pirates a bad name, really,  if I'm being brutally honest.  Oh, well, thanks for watching, kiddies. We'll see you at the 20th anniversary.  That's 10 years from now. Starting now.
