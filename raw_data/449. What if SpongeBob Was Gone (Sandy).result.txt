Narrator:	 What if SpongeBob was gone?
Sandy:	 OK. So are we ready a little karate? Huh, big guy? Can you handle this? Do you think you're ready to witness these skills,  this footwork?  Is too fast for ya?  Too inventive? I just wanna warn you so far and get pretty physical. OK. Now show me your skills. Come on now, don't be shy. Let's see the old one-two!
Sandy:	 Dang.
Sandy:	 This is much more fun with SpongeBob.
