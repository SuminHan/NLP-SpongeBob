Narrator:	 Bikini Bottom Prison. Home of the worst of the worst and currently of that little miscreant Plankton. Otherwise known as number 6-5-5-3-2-1.
Prison Guard 1:	 All inmates to A-level!  Come on number 6-5-5-3-2-1! Let's move it!
Plankton:	  Yeah, yeah! Keep your shirt on!
SpongeBob:	 Psst! Hey, Sheldon!
Plankton:	 SpongeBob?! What in the sea shell are you doing here?!
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs arranged for me to work here on weekends. He wants me to keep an eye on you!
Plankton:	 Excuse me. Doesn't this count as "cruel and unusual punishment"?
Prison Guard 1:	 Pipe down pipsqueak!
SpongeBob:	  Look! They even gave me a training baton! 
SpongeBob:	  Hi Karen!  Look Plankton! Karen came to visit and she brought you a cake! 
Plankton:	 Do you mind?
SpongeBob:	 Oh uh, I'll be right over here. 
Plankton:	 So honey? Is "you know what" inside?
Karen:	 You mean flour, sugar, milk, and eggs?
Plankton:	 No! Uh, no. The "secret ingredient."
Karen:	 Oh, you mean love?
Plankton:	 I mean the file?
Karen:	 What?! The file? Well I'm glad you're not the baker in the family! The file! Who'd put a file in a cake?
Plankton:	  Karen, you got to get me out of here! 
Plankton:	  Phew...
Purple Cellmate:	 You gonna eat that? 
Plankton:	 I'm not even sure what "that" is...
Purple Cellmate:	 Thanks! 
Plankton:	 Wait a second! I didn't say you could-
Reggie:	  You gonna drink that? Thanks!
Plankton:	  Hey! I need that! For my bones! 
SpongeBob:	 Tsk, tsk, tsk. Someone didn't finish their beans!
Light Blue Cellmate:	 That's my beans.
SpongeBob:	 Oh. Well, enjoy! 
Plankton: 	 Wait! Put me down!  Uh oh... You can't eat me! I'm Bikini Bottom's most evil genius! 
Purple Cellmate:	 Hey! What did you say?
Plankton:	  I say I'm Plankton blast it!
Purple Cellmate:	 You ain't Plankton!  We're all big fans of that maniacal little miscreant!  THAT'S Plankton! And you don't look anything like him!
Plankton:	  Hey! I'm in here! I'm Plankton!
Purple Cellmate:	 Ok! That does it! Here comes the pain! 
Plankton:	 Are we at the airport?  Ahem! HEY! Gather 'round fellow convicts! It is I: the one and only Sheldon J. Plankton, evil genius!
Plankton's Cellmates:	 Gasp! It's him! It's him!
Plankton: 	Now let me get this straight, you low-lives respect me?
Purple Cellmate:	 Are you kidding? You're criminal royalty! Every crime you committed is more dangerous than the last!
Reggie:	 You're the worst guy in the joint! And that means you're the greatest in our twisted eyes!
Purple Cellmate: 	We'd do anything for you big guy!
Plankton:	  With this pack of criminals, I can steal the Secret Formula like that!
Plankton:	 Ok gang! We need to bust out of this joint! Any thoughts? 
Light Blue Cellmate:	 We could wait for parole.
Brown Cellmate:	 We could ask them nicely.
Plankton:	 Yeah, I can see why you're still in jail. THINK, people! We need a plan!
Whale Cellmate:	 We could bust out of here in no time! If only we had some Chum!
Purple Cellmate:	 Yeah! Chum!
Light Blue Cellmate:	 That's what we need!
Plankton:	 Yeah! Good old chum. Say what now?
Whale Cellmate:	 Chum's amazing!
Brown Cellmate:	 That's why you're our hero!
Reggie:	 You're the creator of chum!
Plankton: 	Chum? What use is chum?
Purple Cellmate:	 It makes a great disguise!  It's working! It's twisting my appearance! 
Cashier:	 AHHHH! What a hideous monster!  Please take this money so I don't have to look at your disgusting features!
Purple Cellmate: 	Yeah! Works great till, you know, they caught me.
Plankton:	 You ever tried eating it?
Purple Cellmate:	 Ah heavens no! 
Light Blue Cellmate:	 You know what else chum is great for? Robbing banks!  Yeah! The stench of chum is unbearable!
Plankton:	 But have you tried it on a bun?
Light Blue Cellmate:	 No way brother, never! I like my tongue in one piece.
Whale Cellmate:	 Every crook in town uses chum.
Plankton:	 Really? Maybe I overlooked chum's hidden potential! Fellow ne'r-do-wells: If its chum you want its chum you shall have! Luckily, I happen to know the recipe! IT'S TIME FOR A JAILBREAK!!! 
Plankton:	 Listen up reprobates! Chum requires specialized ingredients of the highest quality!
Light Blue Cellmate:	 Mr. Plankton?  Does this meet your rigid, manufacturing standards?
Plankton:	 Hmm...you there!  Sniff this sock!  Yes...let us begin! Cultured fungus growth medium!
Light Blue Cellmate:	 Here you go boss! 
Plankton:	 Subtropical, vegetal matter!
Purple Cellmate:	 Eh, right here! 
Plankton:	 Organic filler.
Reggie:	 Gotcha covered! 
Plankton:	 Hey you!  Blow. Live bacterial culture.  Now, to secure the containment vessel.  Agitate primarily compound!  And quality inspection!  Ok boys! I think it's time we evacuated this institution! 
Plankton's Cellmates:	 Huh?
Plankton:	 Sigh. IT'S TIME TO BREAK OUT OF PRISON, YOU DOPES!!!
Plankton's Cellmates:	 Oh...
SpongeBob:	 A jailbreak!? I got to warn Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs:	  Not bad. If only I could paint him smaller.
SpongeBob:	 MR. KRABS!!!
Mr. Krabs:	  What is it!?
SpongeBob:	 Plankton is breaking out of jail tonight! And he's coming to the Krusty Krab with a bunch of criminals to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula! What do we do?
Mr. Krabs:	 Tonight eh? That doesn't leave me much time! This is gonna be close, but we'll be ready for them! 
Prison Guard 1:	  Woah-ho-oh there! Why are you two out of your cells?
Purple Cellmate:	 Reggie thinks this hankey smells like Kelp Berries!
Prison Guard 1:	 Oh he does, does he? I'll be the judge of that. 
Plankton:	 Chum!  Detonator!  Is this detonator made out of soap?
Whale Cellmate:	 I carved it myself!
Plankton:	 Launch me! 
Prison Guard 2:	 Freeze Plankton! Hold it right there!
Plankton:	  Uh oh... It worked! 
Prison Guard 1:	 It's a jailbreak men! Quick! To the wall! Before they escape!
Prison Guards:	 Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!  Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Plankton:	 What in the name of electrolysis!?
Prison Guards 1:	 Nice try prisoners! But you'll never penetrate a wall of living guards! Let's round up those escaping miscreants!  Oh dear! I cannot move! It appears we have become ensnared in our own defenses! 
Plankton:	 Oh my! That is a dilly of a pickle! Oh well, if you cannot escape through the back wall, I guess we have to leave through the front door!  Quickly my fellow felonons! FOLLOW ME TO THE KRUSTY KRAB!!! 
SpongeBob:	 Oh Mr. Krabs! They're almost here! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't worry SpongeBob! We're ready for 'em!
Plankton:	 I gave you your freedom, now bring me the Krabby Patty Formula!
Plankton's Cellmates:	  Heave-ho! Heave-ho! 
Mr. Krabs:	 They got past me!  Me restaurant!
Plankton:	 Yes! With my new gang of vicious convicts, you're no match for me now Krabs! Fellow jailbirds, bring me the Krabby Patty formula! 
Whale Cellmate:	 Sorry boss. We've looked everywhere for it but we can't find it!
Plankton:	 Did you tried looking in the safe?
Whale Cellmate:	 Oh. 
Plankton:	 EUREKA! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Plankton! Don't do it!
Plankton: 	Sorry Krabs! Nothing can stop me now! 
Policeman:	 Except the law! 
Plankton:	 What's happening!?
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob warned me you're planning a jailbreak so I took the precaution of hiding the entire Bikini Bottom Police Force in me safe!
Policeman:	  Come along, Plankton. It's back to jail for you!
Plankton:	  Hey! Watch where you're pointing that thing buster!
Policeman:	  Just move along.
Mr. Krabs: 	Well, thanks to your hard work, the Krabby Patty recipe is safe!
SpongeBob:	 And you win again! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Yep! I'm a winner!
