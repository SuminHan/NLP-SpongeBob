Narrator:	 Ahhh... The Krusty Krab, Bikini Bottom's answer to fine dining. And here we see one of its patrons now.  Ah... yes, moving on. Oh, it is the SpongeBob, creator of the fine cuisine within. Now let us watch.
Squidward:	 One Krabby Patty, extra grease. 
SpongeBob:	 Whoa! 
Squidward:	 Mmm.
SpongeBob:	 Ooh! 
Squidward:	 
SpongeBob:	  
Squidward:	 GRR...
SpongeBob:	 
Squidward:	 All right, let me see it.  The Krusty Krab work schedule, what's so great about this?
SpongeBob:	  What's so... why, it's my happy book. The Krusty Krab is where all of my happiest memories occurred.
Squidward:	 Hmmm...  Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories.
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Squidward.  I have a whole cabinet of backups.  So what's  happiest memory, Squidward?
Squidward:	 Ummm, let me think...    I guess I don't have a happiest memory. Oh, well. 
Squidward:	 Yes?!
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, you don't have a happiest memory?
Squidward:	 So what?
SpongeBob:	 How can you live without a happiest memory? Do you cry yourself to sleep at night?
Squidward:	 I hear you crying all the time.
SpongeBob:	 Well, with joy, Squidward, with joy.
Squidward:	 Look, I don't need a happy memory, so just get back to your culinary grease factory and leave me alone.
Sandals:	 Hey, I'd like to order a Krabby Patty.  Okay... can someone else take my order?
Sandals:	 I'll wait.
Squidward:	 You're right, SpongeBob, I don't have a happy memory. This is horrible.
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Squidward, I'll help you make a happiest memory.
Squidward:	 Really? Do you think you can?
SpongeBob:	 No problem.
Squidward:	 Well, it's against my better judgement, but, okay.
SpongeBob:	 You love music, right, Squidward?
Squidward:	 Mmm hmm.
SpongeBob:	 Then this will definitely be your happiest memory!
Squidward:	 Hey, this isn't so bad. I think I actually feel kinda...happy!
SpongeBob:	 See? Your happiest memory is forming!
SpongeBob:	 Oops. That was a sour note. 
Squidward:	 This is not my happiest memory...
Squidward:	 Why are we at the Art Museum?
SpongeBob:	 Well, you love art. Maybe you'll find a happiest moment in here!
Squidward:	 Great... I get to see all the art of people who have succeeded where I've failed. My art will never be shown in this...   What the? This... this is my sculpture! How did it get here?
Art Critic:	  Oh! You're just in time! Art lovers, this is Squidward Tentacles! Creator of this piece! 
SpongeBob:	 Wow! Your work at a museum Squidward!
Squidward:	  Gosh! I can't believe it! I think this might be it!
SpongeBob:	 Your happiest memory?
Squidward:	 Yeah!
Art Critic:	 And now the performance artist Fiasco will say a few words about this piece 
Squidward:	 Gosh! Fiasco himself is talking about my art!
Fiasco:	 Ahem! Squid... ward... go toward... the light...  of my flamethrower! 
Squidward:	 And now he's melted it... Not a happiest memory...
SpongeBob:	 Um... it's kinda smokey in here!  You need fresh air!
SpongeBob:	 What a majestic view!
Squidward:	 What view?
SpongeBob:	 Oh yeah! I forgot about your blindfold!  Isn't it beautiful?
Squidward:	  Very nice... except that I'm AFRAID OF HEIGHTS!
SpongeBob:	 Oh! Sorry Squidward! I'll take us down! 
Squidward:	  Wait! No!  Oh boy...  Oh yeah...nice view...
Harold:	  Son of a seahorse! Twenty years of training and a couple of amateurs just leap out of a balloon! Here!  You plant it!  All that time and money and resources wasted on...
SpongeBob:	 Hey! We're the first to ever reach the top of Mt. Bikini! Surely that makes for a happiest memory! I claim this mountain in the name of Squidward Tentacles! 
Squidward:	  Uh oh...
Harold:	 Stupid amateurs...  Fantastic... 
Squidward:	 Time to face facts. I'll never have a happiest memory.  And if I do, it definitely won't involve you.  Hello misery... I'm home...  I might as well go to bed for a hundred years or so.  Wake me when I'm dead... 
Narrator:	 Two weeks later...
SpongeBob:	  Gary, I am worried about Squidward. He hasn't come out of his house for two weeks now!
Gary:	 
SpongeBob:	  Why isn't he answering?  Squidward! Squidward! Now I'm really worried! Squidward! SQUIDWARD!  Gasp! Squidward! Down here! He's upstairs!  Hey! Hey! Squidward!  Well at least we know that he is still alive. Uh oh...  I'm okay Gary!
Gary:	 Meow...
SpongeBob:	 Squidward sure seems depressed. I think I'll call him to cheer him up!  Hello? Squidward? Are you there?  Squidward? Are you there? Squidward?
Gary:	 Meow?
SpongeBob:	 Gary? What are you doing at Squidward's? Uh Gare? Can you put Squidward on the phone?  Hold on a second, someone is on the other line.  Hello? Hello!? HELLO!?  Hello? 
Squidward:	 I just can't seem to get happy...  Well, that didn't help...  Huh? That's strange, I could have swear I just threw that darn phone away.  Oh yeah. My fax machine. Now, why did I buy that again?
SpongeBob:	  Hi Squidward!  You sure are a hard man to get a hold of!  Hey, do I smell brownies?
Squidward:	 Yes...  Thanks for stopping by. 
Gary:	 Sigh... meow. 
SpongeBob:	 Thanks Gary! I have to find a way to give Squidward a happiest memory. These pants may be square, but it's time to think outside the box!
Squidward:	  I can't seem to get happy...  Maybe this will help.  Nope... I guess not...  Oh great... I wonder who that could be...  You're not SpongeBob.
Mailfish:	 I have a package for a Squidward "Tentaclees"?
Squidward:	 "Tentacles". Yes that's me.
Mailfish:	 Well here you go. 
Squidward:	 Thanks...  Doesn't say who's it from. No doubt SpongeBob is hiding inside. Ah well, here goes nothing.  GOTCHA! Huh?  It's empty. Empty, just like my miserable life!  I see nothing but darkness ahead...  SpongeBob!? 
SpongeBob:	 Surprise! I figured out you needed a party to help cheer you up! Unfortunately, everybody I tried to invite was busy or sick but don't worry! I used my paper mâché skills to fill the party with your favorite person: me!  So what do you think? Happiest memory or what?
Squidward:	 You don't seem to understand.  I... don't... WANT... A... HAPPIEST MEMORY! 
SpongeBob:	 So you enjoying the d'oevuers?
Squidward:	  I feel WONDERFUL!  This is it, my happiest memory!
SpongeBob:	 Sigh... he's so handsome!
