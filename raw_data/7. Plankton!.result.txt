Squidward:	  One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don't have the whole day. 
SpongeBob:	 Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty. 
Squidward:	 Come on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Next, les ingredients.  Ah, oui!  Les mustard. 
Squidward:	 Les quit fooling around, where's my Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob:	 Les hold on a second!  And voila!  It's under your nose! 
Squidward:	 You're killing me SpongeBob! Ha ha ha... you really are. .
SpongeBob:	 Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty..
Squidward:	 Okay, give it to me.  Come on SpongeBob, stop it!
SpongeBob:	  I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Avast, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is...  Plankton! Stealing me booty!
Plankton:	 [first lines] Hear me Krabs. When I discover your formula for Krabby Patties, I'll run you out of business. I went to college!  Hey! Let me go!
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer!  Back to the Chum Bucket with you!
Plankton:	 You'll pay for this Krabs! 
SpongeBob:	 Uh.. Plankton, sir?
Mr. Krabs:	 Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years. But you haven't got it yet, have ye bug?  Okay.  Enough lad, it wasn't that funny.  Get back to work! 
SpongeBob:	  Okay Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!
Mr. Krabs:	 Good night, me boy! 
Plankton:	  Psst... young man.  Yes, over here. Come on boy, a little closer.  Closer...  Not that close!  You blasted barnacle head! I mean... hi. 
SpongeBob:	 Plankton? What do you want?
Plankton:	 I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?
SpongeBob:	 Um... no.
Plankton:	 Acquaintances?
SpongeBob:	 No.
Plankton:	 Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?
SpongeBob:	 I... guess so.
Plankton:	 You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment.  Ding!  Sparkle, sparkle.
SpongeBob:	 Wow! A golden spatula! And its even got my name on it.
Plankton:	 It's a gift! A gift from a friend.  Friends give each other gifts. And tomorrow is my birthday.  And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? .
SpongeBob:	 A booster seat? .
Plankton:	 Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you my friend, is one of those  tender... delicious... Krabby Patties! 
SpongeBob:	 You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow.
Plankton:	 Gee, and I thought you were stupid.
SpongeBob:	 You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me!  Even if we are friends!  Never, never, never, never!
Plankton:	 Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool! 
SpongeBob:	 Good night Gary. 
Plankton:	  SpongeBob, you will be mine! 
Woman in the recording:	 Letters of the alphabet, A-B-C...
Plankton:	 It should be in here... but where?  Where? Oh...  This will be the beginning of the end!  Ouch! Stupid brain...  Come back here you swine!  That's it brain, you're going down!  Yes, yes, that's grand.  And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan.  And now it's time for a little wakey-uppy. 
SpongeBob:	 Morning already?  I... I feel a little funny today. 
Plankton:	 I have you now! 
SpongeBob:	 Time for a well-balanced breakfast.  This isn't what I had in mind.  Let me just grab my pants.  I guess I'm not wearing any pants today.  I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later Gary! ...I guess.  You're right, Gary! There  something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help!  Squidward! Help!
Squidward:	 Be quiet, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob:	 Help!
Squidward:	 SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm talking to you! SpongeBob! SpongeBob, are you mad? 
Plankton:	  Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.
Squidward:	 Mediocre? 
Plankton:	 You pretentious little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste! 
SpongeBob:	 Something must be wrong with my brain!  Plankton!  What kind of friend are you?
Plankton:	 Nonsense. You never liked me anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party! 
SpongeBob:	 Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!  Never! Never! 
Plankton:	  Toot toot! How about a little take-out?
SpongeBob:	 No, never!  You can't fool me Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty secret formula! 
Plankton:	 You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!
SpongeBob:	 No, no, no!  There's no one here.
Plankton:	 Don't remind me. Brace yourself SpongeBob, this is my lab!  And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player? 
SpongeBob:	 I must fight! 
Plankton:	 No, no, no, no.  There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it. 
Computer:	 Seaweed: 50% Sea, 50% Weed. 
Plankton:	 Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula.  And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty.  This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants? 
SpongeBob:	 I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down.  I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, you delicate little Krabby Patty.
Plankton:	 Mmm...
SpongeBob:	  With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness. 
Plankton:	 Steamy... 
SpongeBob:	 I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns. 
Plankton:	 Yes... yes... YES!  Come to papa!  Oh boy... 
Computer:	 Plankton: 1% evil, 99% hot gas. 
Plankton:	 Well, this stinks.
SpongeBob:	 Well patty, I guess we can go home now. 
Plankton:	 SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty!  Give it back, you porous freak! I command you! My patty!  Nooooo! I'll settle for some fries.
