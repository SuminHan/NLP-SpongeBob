SpongeBob:	 Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time.  Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way,  or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way...  So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
SpongeBob:	 Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch  Huh? "New" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm. 
SpongeBob:	 Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!...  ...Please...  ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages.
Subliminal Girl:	 
SpongeBob:	 "I'm sorry you had to see that."  Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath. What? Can you say that again? Slow down, it's like you're speaking some other language!  Hey Gar! How 'bout some leap frog? Weehee! Okay, your turn.  Hey Gar! How 'bout some leap frog?  ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house!  Ya-da-da-da... [stops dancing] That didn't work either, huh?  Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house. Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure. Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen... 40. The treasure must be in here!  Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest.
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Why no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub. [Kicks away a paint can] It's treasure. Look, doubloons.  Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch! 
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?!  Get in the tub!  Get in the tub!!  Get in the tub...  In the tub.  In the tub!  Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to... [pulls up Gary off the floor but both end up dangling from the ceiling] Gary, could you...  Gary, no! [Gary pulls in other eye] Gary! . Alright, Gary, you have duped, and/or, frustrated me for the last time. So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. . Psst, Gary. Bath delivery. . Come back, Gary. I have something to "chair" with you.  "Dishes" more like it. "Water" you waiting for, Gary?
Gary:	 
SpongeBob:	 Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary. . Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin.  Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant. I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath, and you are going to get clean right now.
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 I am so the boss of you!
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules.
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say. [Gary slithers forward] What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister. [Gary stops right next to some mud] Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary, the snail, do you hear me? I am giving you three seconds to get away from that mud puddle. One, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two, [Gary moves closer to the mud] two and a half...[Gary leans over the mud] don't make me say three!  Gary! Gary! Gary! GARY!  I'm a dirty boy.
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, yeah, Gary. I'm getting behind my ears.
