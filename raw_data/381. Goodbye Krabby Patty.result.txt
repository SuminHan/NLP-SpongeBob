SpongeBob:	 Oh, oh.
Patrick:	 No, no, just—
SpongeBob:	 Whoa. 
Patrick:	 It's harder to walk, but worth it.
SpongeBob:	 Ahh, the perfect end to a perfect day: buying ourselves the perfect ice cream.
Patrick:	 So many flavors.
Both:	 Whoo-hoo!
SpongeBob:	 Hmm, what brand should we buy, Hogen Duep?
Patrick:	 No, that's too fancy.
Both:	 Rocky road!
Patrick:	 With real rocks!
SpongeBob:	 Rocky road, unlike our friendship, which is a smooth avenue and will never have any bumps.
Mr. Krabs:	 Bump.  When did food get so ugly?
Mr. Krabs:	  "Lonely Krab Dinner for One: Now 30% lonelier." Eee, can't believe what they're charging for this frozen debris, and I can't believe they're selling so much of it. But it sure is convenient.
SpongeBob:	 Can you imagine if they had frozen Krabby Patties at the supermarket? Oh, that would be so convenient, everyone in the world could enjoy them.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, that's a million dollar idea that I just had that you just said before me.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hello, welcome to my commercial. Would you like the convenience of a Krabby Patty at home, without the hassle of going to the Krusty Krab? Well, now you can.  Have delicious Krabby Patties any time you want.  They're in your grocer's freezer section. Buy them. I want your money! Did you get that, Pearly-girl?
Pearl:	 Yes, Daddy, and stop babying me!
Mr. Krabs:	 So, Mr. Grouper, what do you think?
Don Grouper:	 Call me Don.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, well, okay, Don. Will this make me rich?
Don Grouper:	 Mr. Krabs, if you wanna sell zero Krabby Patties and wind up in the poor house, then I say go with your commercial.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh.
Don Grouper:	 But if you really want to be rich, keep your mouth shut, and listen to us, sir. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh. Okay.
Don Grouper:	 Let me introduce you to the team here at GGK. That's Barry Goby, Rob Koi, and Limia with her team from creative. Everyone, this is Mr. Krabs and a yellow box.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, uh, actually, my name is Spon-
Don Grouper:	 Let's say we give a look-see at what we've cooked up for you.
Don Grouper:	 The Krabby Patty, a mainstay of dining in Bikini Bottom for a very long time,  like an old friend, but not too old, because research shows us old is gross.
Limia:	 Yes, oh, it's absolutely...
Barry Goby:	 Oh, of course...
Rob Koi:	 Just gross.
Barry Goby:	 Yeah, no, it's disgusting.
Old Executive:	 Well, I don't think old is gross.
Baby Executive:	 Goo-goo, social networking, ah, ah!
Don Grouper:	 Exactly. Now, here are some of the slogans we've been kicking around.
Don Grouper:	 "Krabby Patties: Like a friend, but edible."  "Krabby Patties: The shut-in's favorite patty."  And finally, "Krabby Patties: Shove 'em in your mouth-hole!" 
SpongeBob:	 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I have a slogan!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, uh, "Krabby Patties: Taste so nice that they... taste nice."
Mr. Krabs:	 Let's just leave it to the professionals, boy-o.
Don Grouper:	 The thing is, Frozen Krabby Patties are a convenience for everyone, and we need a campaign that says exactly that. We need a regular guy to represent all consumers.
SpongeBob:	 Me!
Don Grouper:	 Someone everyone can relate to...
SpongeBob:	 Oh, me, me!
Don Grouper:	 With a face that says, "I love Krabby Patties."
Don Grouper:	 We find that face, and we have our campaign.
Mr. Krabs:	 And I've got the perfect guy for the job.
Patrick:	 Krabby Patties: They taste so nice, that they taste nice.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, that was my slogan.
Don Grouper:	 Great stuff, huh? This guy is gonna be a star!
Patrick:	 I'm already a star.
Don Grouper:	 That's the attitude.
Patrick:	 Hey, SpongeBob, now that I'm finished doing whatever it is I'm doing, you wanna go play?
SpongeBob:	 
Limia:	 Sorry, yellow box, Patrick has to make a personal appearance at the mall.
SpongeBob:	 I—oh...
Mr. Krabs:	 Don, will this commercial really help me make money?
Don Grouper:	 You need to call your bank, Krabs, because they are gonna have to build an extra vault to hold all the extra money.
Mr. Krabs:	  Ooh, I do declare, Mr. Grouper, I believe I have a case of the vapors.
Don Grouper:	 I told you, call me Don. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Don.
Don Grouper:	 Of course, you could double, maybe even triple of quadruple that money, if you... No, forget it.
Mr. Krabs:	 What? Forget what? What? What?! What are you saying?
Don Grouper:	 Well, we ran some numbers and realized that you could make a lot more money if you... changed the formula.
Mr. Krabs:	 How much "a lot more"?
Don Grouper:	 A lot "a lot more."
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, then let's fill her up with filler!
SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs, are you changing the secret Krabby Patty formula?
Mr. Krabs:	 Heh, no, I-I can— well, it's just a little tweak, me boy.
SpongeBob:	 But what is "filler"?
Don Grouper:	  Whoa, hey, this little yellow box sure is full of questions. What do you say we go see where the money's made?
Mr. Krabs:	 Ho-ho, that sounds great!
Don Grouper:	 Take a look around. It's your dream come true. Through the wonders of automation, this factory can make as many Krabby Patties in one minute as you used to make in a week. Take a whiff of the future, Krabs. Does it smelly like money?
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh, yeah.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, why does that barrel say "sand"?
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, it's imported. It's spelled "sand" but it's pronounced, "filler."
Don Grouper:	 Hey, let's check in on our taste test area.
Fish Guy:	 Hmm. This tastes kind of bad.
Limia:	  Would you buy it, though?
Fish Guy:	 Well, yeah, for the convenience... and the face of that stupid guy  Though I have noticed a bit of a side effect. Hmm-hmm.
Limia:	  He loves it.
Executive:	 Great news, Krabs. Sales are going all the way up to the surface of the ocean. Here's your first check.
Mr. Krabs:	 Huh?
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm rich, boy-o, rich.
SpongeBob:	 Great, can we go back to the Krusty Krab now?
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes, yes, we can.
SpongeBob:	 Hooray, finally!
Mr. Krabs:	 Whatcha doing, boy?
SpongeBob:	 Making Krabby Patties.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, no, you've made your last Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob:	 You mean my last one for the morning rush?
Mr. Krabs:	 No, ever.
SpongeBob:	 You mean my last one for today-ever?
Mr. Krabs:	 No, I mean forever and ever. You're fired.
SpongeBob:	  Fired?
Mr. Krabs:	 But I'm ready to re-hire you.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, please, re-hire me Mr. Krabs. I'll do anything.
Mr. Krabs:	 Then follow me.
Robot Patrick:	 This tastes nice.
Robot Plankton:	 Ow, curses, foiled again, ow.
SpongeBob:	 You turned the Krusty Krab into some kind of museum?
Mr. Krabs:	 That's right, me boy. It's all history now, but you, you have the most important job of all.  You give tours and sell tchotchkes in the gift shop.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, but what if someone wants a Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, we've got plenty of Krabby Patties right here in the freezer.
Patrick Microwave:	 Ding.
Mr. Krabs:	 You see? Customers at the museum can cook the patties themselves, like this.
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah, it's so convenient, see? 
Squidward:	 And what about me?
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't worry, Squidward. You're fired.
Squidward:	 Well, do I get re-hired for a new job at the museum too?
Mr. Krabs:	 Heh! No, you're just fired.
Squidward:	 What? No, you don't fire me—I quit! I got my resignation letter all prepared.  "Dear Mr. Krabs—"
Mr. Krabs:	 Do you have a ticket, sir? Can't be in a museum without a ticket.
Squidward:	 What the—what?!  "I-I-I tender my resignation from this greasy establishment. Too long have I toiled under your iron claw. Now I am free—free to live my dreams of being a ballet dancer, ha-ha, and the first chair clarinet in the Bikini Bottom Orchestra, ha-ha, and I am going to finally publish my mystery/thriller novel: 'Dial D for Doily!"
SpongeBob:	 Ahem,  "hello, and welcome to the Krusty Krab Museum, the original home of the Krabby Patty, now available in the frozen food section of your local supermarket."
SpongeBob:	 Oh, and don't forget to buy souvenirs at the gift shop.
Mr. Krabs:	 Atta boy, embrace the future!
Elevator Operator:	 Going up?
SpongeBob:	 I'm going to a party—a party to celebrate my friend's upcoming 400th commercial.
Elevator Operator:	 Uh-huh.
SpongeBob:	 I brought ice cream. Me and my best friend are gonna share the ice cream. Who knows? Maybe we'll even get a chance to share pants.  Again.
Elevator Operator:	  You should get out. Now.
SpongeBob:	 Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.
Colonel Sandab:	 Uh, Patrick, did you order something through the mail? 'Cause a yellow box just arrived for you.
Patrick:	 SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Oh, I'm sure glad you made it to my party.
Colonel Sandab:	 Uh, excuse me, yellow box, are you feeling a little overheated? Because I do—I say, I do believe that you are melting. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, yeah, I guess I should get this in a freezer. Patrick, where's the kitchen?
Patrick:	 Oh, I don't know.
Limia:	 It's just past the solid gold gym. Take a right at the zoo.
SpongeBob:	 I'll come with you, SpongeBob.
Limia:	 He can find the kitchen by himself. The press needs some photos of you with your new mascot friends.
SpongeBob:	  Aww.
Patrick:	  Aww.
Press:	 This way, Mr. Star! Hey, Patrick, over here! Over here, right here! Who are you wearing?
French Narrator:	 The next day...
SpongeBob:	 Whoa, oof!
Squidward:	 Ow.
SpongeBob:	  Squidward? What are you doing here? I thought you were off following your dreams.
Squidward:	 I was. They turned out to be nightmares. Apparently, you need more than 17 years behind a cash register to be qualified for dreams.  I never thought I would say this, but I'm begging you, SpongeBob, let me come back and work at the Krusty Krab Museum.
SpongeBob:	 I guess you could help out the animatronic Squidward. There's something about him that seems a little off.
Robot Squidward:	 I love my job. Thanks for coming!
Squidward:	 Totally out of character.
Squidward:	  I hate everyone.  Huh, much better.
French Narrator:	 Later...
Patrick:	  "Tastes so nice that they—"
Squidward:	 They taste like lice!
Patrick:	 Oh, now I gotta start over! Ooh, someone fix that broken robot.
Squidward:	 Huh?
Squidward:	 What are you doing with this—ow!
Patrick:	  "Tastes so nice that they taste nice."
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Patrick, rehearsing your big 400th commercial, huh?
Limia:	 Excuse me, yellow box, Mr. Star is not to be disturbed. He's very, very busy right now.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, sure. I get it.
Patrick:	 But he's my friend.
Limia:	 You're a star. You have no friends.
Patrick:	  What am I doing again?
Don Grouper:	 Stand over here and say your line. And...action.
Patrick:	 Tastes so nice, it... uh...  blah, blah, blahblahbli-blah...
Don Grouper:	 And..cut! Alright, you guys can fix that in post. Okay? that's a wrap. Let's pack it up.
Limia:	 Okay, and here. And here. Okay, and then sign here. And again here.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, there's something weird about these Frozen Krabby Patties.
Filmmaker 2:	 Looks like you've been hitting the patties pretty hard there.
Filmmaker 1:	 Speak for yourself.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, nothing's been the same since those frozen patties came out.  I miss the old Krusty Krab. I miss Patrick—oof!
Limia:	 Come on, Mr. Star. You've got an 11:00 eyeball waxing.
Patrick:	  See you later, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	  Aww.
Plankton:	 Finally, now is my chance to strike.
SpongeBob:	 Welcome to the original Krusty—
Robot Plankton:	 Curses, foiled again. Curses, foiled again.
Plankton:	 Pfft, never happened.
Plankton:	 Now to make my escape.
Plankton:	 Aren't you gonna try and stop me?
SpongeBob:	 That'll be $1.99, please.
Plankton:	 What do you mean, $1.99? You're not gonna step on me? I've got the secret formula, you know.
SpongeBob:	 Anyone can have a secret formula. We sell them in the gift shop.
SpongeBob:	 See? They're all just fakes.  Everything here is a fake!
Plankton:	 Eh, forget it. What's the world coming to?  All right, just give me one Frozen Krabby Patty to go.
Patrick Microwave:	 Ding.
Plankton:	  Yes, you fools!
Squidward:	 Shouldn't we chase after him? He didn't pay.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, what's the point? These Frozen Krabby Patties have ruined my life, Squidward. And it was all my idea. Who am I to fight the future?
SpongeBob:	 Sand?! It tastes like sand! Not good sand, either.
Squidward:	 Of course it does. What do you think Krabs uses as filler?
SpongeBob:	 Krabby Patties aren't made with sand! They're made with love.
SpongeBob:	 Mm! I am going to show the world what a fresh,  not frozen Krabby Patty tastes like, and the first one is for my best friend, Patrick.
Press:	 Over here. Right here, Patrick. Right here, right here. One, more, Patrick.
Agent:	 Patrick, baby, sweetheart, have you thought about that feature film I pitched youse?
Patrick:	 That's it. I can't take it anymore. Everybody out!
Patrick:	 I wish things could go back to the way they were. Mm...  I just wanna be able to share one pair of pants with my best friend without it being in the papers.
SpongeBob:	 Freshly grilled Krabby Patty, you and I are going to save the world. And save a friendship.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick!
Patrick:	 SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, the frozen patties are made with sand!
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, what?
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, the Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand!
Patrick:	  I thought they tasted familiar!
Patrick:	 SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Missed you.
Patrick:	 I missed you too.
SpongeBob:	  I got something for you, from one friend to another.
Patrick:	 No, no, I don't wanna eat another one of those things!
Patrick:	 Mm! Now that's a real Krabby Patty! Oh, as delicious as our real friendship.
SpongeBob:	 Now that we've saved our friendship, we have to save the reputation of the Krabby Patty.
Patrick:	 But I have to speak at a shareholders meeting tonight. How am I gonna say nice things about frozen patties now that I know they're filled with sand? 
SpongeBob:	 Well, Patrick, you're just gonna have to listen to your heart... and your stomach.
Don Grouper:	 Thank you, everyone, for coming to this gala event celebrating the meteoric success of Frozen Krabby Patties. In honor of this momentous occasion, we are going to premiere our 400th commercial.
Mr. Krabs:	 And here to say a few words is the face of the Frozen Krabby Patty, our own Patrick Star. Come on up, Patrick!
Patrick:	 Good evening, ladies and... the other ones. I know you're all excited to see the 400th commercial, but before we see it, I just want to say...
Patrick:	 That... that...Frozen Krabby Patties are...
SpongeBob:	 Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Patrick:	 ...Made with sand!
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh, no!
Don Grouper:	 That was cute when you were rich.  I'm out of here.
Perch Perkins:	 And in shocking news today, it has been revealed that Frozen Krabby Patties are made with sand.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, it's gone. Everything I spent me life building is all gone. I'm ruined.  What?
Harold:	 Now that's the taste I remember.
Mr. Krabs:	 That's strange.
Mr. Krabs:	 Mr. Squidward, what is going on in here?
Squidward:	 Uh,  I am Animatronic Squidward. I cannot answer questions.
Mr. Krabs:	 Squidward!
Squidward:	  It was SpongeBob's idea. Him and Patrick are behind this. They forced me to help.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, did you do all this?
SpongeBob:	 Absolutely! Well, Patrick helped.
Patrick:	 A friend always helps. It's called "frelping," and I was very frelpful.
Mr. Krabs:	 But how did you get these customers to eat Krabby Patties? They know they're filled with sand.
SpongeBob:	 The frozen ones are, but these are made fresh.
Mr. Krabs:	  Fresh?
SpongeBob:	 Go on, have a bite.
Mr. Krabs:	 No, no I—
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, just a nibble.
Mr. Krabs:	 Here!
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh, the flavor.  The sweet, greasy nectar of the gods. How much are you charging for these patties, boy-o?
SpongeBob:	 Nothing, we're not selling them.
Patrick:	 Yeah, we just give them away.
Mr. Krabs:	  Agh, SpongeBob, me boy, you've done a good thing here, lad, but you could use a little frelp, I think.  How about we partner up, and I become your boss and pay you minimum wage while I work you mercilessly? What do you say?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah! The Krusty Krab is back in business!
Mr. Krabs:	 Great, now get back to work!
