SpongeBob:	 I can't wait to see the ancient rains, I even brought an umbrella. 
Sandy:	 Ancient ruins, not rains. 
SpongeBob:	 Gee, Sandy! I can't wait to see the inside.
Sandy:	 Behold! The uncharted caverns of Lameria. Now remember, SpongeBob, this place is filled with delicate artifacts, don't touch anything.
SpongeBob:	  Hey look, an ancient Lamorian toilet plunger,  he-he sorry.  This place is sure a Brain Twister.
Sandy:	 I'm losing track of which way is up in here.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I'd say up is...  Oh, that way.
Sandy:	 Up is that way?
SpongeBob:	 Yep.
Sandy:	 Then that means...  Oh, boy.
SpongeBob and Sandy:	 Ahhhhhh... 
Sandy:	 We're ok, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Oh! Ok.
SpongeBob and Sandy:	  Wow!
Sandy:	 Looks like some sort of control module or maybe a holographic projector.  Whoops! Well, I guess we're gonna find out what this doohickey does. 
SpongeBob:	  Oooh, purty.
Sandy:	 SpongeBob, no!  Look out! 
SponbeBob:	 What's it doing? 
Sandy:	 This place sure got a friendlying hurry.  Duck! 
SpongeBob:	 Aww! Look, cute.  Kinda reminds me of bubble blowing. 
Sandy:	 Woah, what is this place?
Robot #1:	 You now stand in the most sacred place in all of Lameria.
SpongeBob:	  Mesmerizing.
Robot #1:	 I see you are an art lover, the sculpture of the Sphere Laser Dichotomy, it really holds the room together.
Sandy:	 I didn't realize the Lamerians were a race of robots.
Robot #1:	 Not originally.  The Lamerians actually created us as a legion of janitor bots, and that's what we did until the great disaster.  But, when we realized that we were the only survivors, we took it upon ourselves to maintain the technology and customs of the once great civilization.  That's not to say it's been easy, it's been a couple of millennia.
SpongeBob:	 Ooh! Really, really, mesmerizing. 
Robot #1:	 You fools, what have you done? We told you, it  holds the room together.
SpongeBob:	 Sorry, I didn't think you meant it literally!
Narrator:	 Two Days Later.....
SpongeBob:	  Gee, I feel bad for those poor robots, they worked so hard to keep this place clean.
Sandy:	 Speaking of which.
Robot #1:	  Those two idiots.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, please forgive me robots, I didn't mean to ruin your ruins.
Robot #1:	 Oh, what's the point. Our way of life has been destroyed, we no longer have a purpose.
Robot #3:	 Looks like a good place to just dry out in the sun. 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, hey, don't be down. I know just the thing to get you out of this funk.
SpongeBob:	 How's it going guys?
Robot #2:	 Wonderful.
Robot #3:	 Very fulfilled!
Robot #1:	  Thank you, you have restored our dignity.
Mr. Krabs:	 Uhh, how much are these tin cans gonna cost me?
SpongeBob:	 Not a penny, there just doing what they were made to do.
Mr. Krabs:	 No thanks, SpongeBob, I'm already not paying  to clean the toilets.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, but Mr. Krabs, I did accidentally destroyed their way of life.
Mr. Krabs:	  Just fooling sonny, and besides, why would I start saying no to free labor now?
