SpongeBob:	  Wow, four stingers.  Where have I seen this before?  Here it is!  Land squirrel.  That little squirrel is in trouble. 
Sandy:	 Take that, you sorry old clam! Y'all need to learn some manners!  You're about as ugly as homemade soup.
SpongeBob:	 Hooray, land squirrel!  Look out!  Hold on, little squirrel!  You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai!  Hey, I'm actually doing it.  Your shell is mine!
Sandy:	 Hold on there, little square dude! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, you like karate too!  So, uhh, what's your name?
Sandy:	 Sandy.  So what do y'all call yourself?
SpongeBob:	  I'm SpongeBob! 
Sandy:	 Well SpongeBob, take a gander at this! 
SpongeBob:	 Oh. Oh yeah? Watch this! 
Sandy:	 I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah!
SpongeBob:	 Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah! Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head?
Sandy:	 Why, that's my air helmet.
SpongeBob:	 May I try it on?
Sandy:	 Heck, no. I need it to breath! I gotta have my air.
SpongeBob:	 Me too! I love air! Air is good.
Sandy:	 No kidding?
SpongeBob:	 Why, "air" is my middle name! The more air, the better! Can't get enough of that air.
Sandy:	 Shee-oot. How about coming over tomorrow for tea and cookies then?  Don't be late!
SpongeBob:	 Okay, see you tomorrow.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?
Patrick:	 Huh?
SpongeBob:	 I just met this girl! She wears a hat full of... air!
Patrick:	 Do you mean she puts on "airs"?
SpongeBob:	 I guess so.
Patrick:	 Thats just fancy talk. If you want to be fancy, hold your pinky up like this! The higher you hold it, the fancier you are!
SpongeBob:	  How's that?
Patrick:	 Higher!
SpongeBob:	 Like that?
Patrick:	 Now that's fancy! They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants!  Remember: When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching.
SpongeBob:	 Thanks pal. 
Sandy:	 Hello?
SpongeBob:	 Hi-ya, Sandy. Its me, SpongeBob!
Sandy:	 Hold on a sec, I'll let you in.
SpongeBob:	  Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy!  Sandy, somethings gone terribly wrong. There's no water in...  ...here.
Sandy:	 Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air.
SpongeBob:	  No water?
Sandy:	 That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah!
SpongeBob:	 Problem?  Hi-yah! That's how I like my air!  With no water.
Sandy:	  Well, all right. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah!  That's not in. In!  You're a funny little dude. Come on, I'll give you the grand tour.  This is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest...  ...purest...  ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath.  And that's my oak tree.  It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane, that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bees knees? Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I...  ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Lets have that tea now. 
Patrick:	 Pinky! Pinky!
SpongeBob:	  I brought you some flowers.
Sandy:	  For me? How sweet!  You okay?
SpongeBob:	  Yes, I'm okay.
Sandy:	 You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit.
SpongeBob:	 I cant imagine why.
Sandy:	 Can I get you anything?
SpongeBob:	 Water would be nice.
Sandy:	 I'm gonna to put these in a vase.
SpongeBob:	 Take your time.  I gotta get out of here! Aaaaahh! 
Sandy:	  I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree!
Patrick:	  When in doubt, pinky out.
SpongeBob:	  I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it... 
Sandy:	 Why, these flowers are just beautiful!  They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice, cold water.  So tell me about yourself.  It must be fascinating being a sea critter.  SpongeBob?  Oh, there's the cookies.  Be right back.
SpongeBob:	  I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I don't need it.  I NEED IT! 
Patrick:	 No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky!
SpongeBob:	  I'm a quitter!  
Patrick:	  You can't leave now! You'll blow it!
SpongeBob:	  Air is not good, Patrick! Air is not good!
Patrick:	  You're just being shy. Don't worry, buddy. You're doing fine.  I won't let you blow... this.  WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS?!  There's no water in here!
SpongeBob:	  I tried to tell you!
Patrick:	 We've got to get out of here!
SpongeBob:	 You're... doing it... wrong...
Patrick:	 We know, We've got... to get... out.
Sandy:	  Come and get it! Y'all gonna like this...
Sandy:	 There, that ought to do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda asked.  I propose a toast, to new friends!  Hold on a second.  I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up! 
All:	 Ahhh!
