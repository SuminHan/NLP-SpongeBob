Old Man Jenkins:	 I just can't decide what to order.
Squidward:	 You already ordered.
Old Man Jenkins:	 Don't rush me, young lady!
Squidward:	 Hurry up, SpongeBob!
Squidward:	 What is taking you so long?
SpongeBob:	 I'm adding the love!
Squidward:	 You're not being paid to love.
SpongeBob:	 Well, I'm not here for the money.  I'll always treasure these moments we had together.
Squidward:	 Look!!!
SpongeBob:	 Awww...
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, I'll be cooked in butter! It's Jim, the Original Fry Cook!
Jim:	 Krabs!
SpongeBob:	 The Jim!?! He who flipped patties in the before times?
Mr. Krabs:	 You're doin' well, Jim. Is that limo solid gold?
Jim:	 It sure is. I was on my way to my solid gold mansion next to my solid gold lake, when I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane.
Squidward:	 Good ol' Jim! When you worked here, the place had class.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah. When this place had class...  Well, we've had some good times, too. Right, Squidward?
Squidward:	 No.
Jim:	 Hey, that's new. "Employee of the Month", huh?
SpongeBob:	 That's me!
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't worry, Jim. No one could ever replace you. The original is still underneath.
Mr. Krabs:	 Your "Best Employee Ever" award! SpongeBob! Sweep up this mess while Jim and I catch up.
SpongeBob:	 Yes, sir.
Jim:	 After I left The Krusty Krab I worked at some of the finest restaurants around the world. I got so successful, I was able to retire in luxury.
SpongeBob:	 Would you sign my Krabby Patty?
Jim:	 Oh, I... Don't sign what I didn't make.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, bigshot! Why don't you step behind the fryer for old time's sake?
Jim:	 You're on, Krabs! But I'll have to charge you!
Mr. Krabs:	 Aye, you always knew how to make me laugh. You just don't find employees like that anymore.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah. Not unless you look RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!!!
Mr. Krabs:	  You're right, boy. I appreciate you, Squidward!
Squidward:	 Now I feel complete!
Mr. Krabs:	 Now how's about that patty?
Jim:	 Everyone, watch and learn!
Bodyguard #1:	 No one watches Jim.
Jim:	 One patty! The right way.
Mr. Krabs:	 It's a thing of beauty!
SpongeBob:	 What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway?  Meh, it's OK.  Wow! That was... amazing!  Uh, Mr. Jim, sir?
Jim:	 Oh, hey! You... You're the guy... who sweeps up, right?
SpongeBob:	 I'm the new fry cook, sir.
Jim:	 Oh! You made that... stepped-on thing I saw earlier, right?
SpongeBob:	 Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie?
Jim:	 Besides don't step on the food?
SpongeBob:	 Please critique my work! I wish to learn at the feet of the master!
Jim:	 Now that's the way to grovel. I'll do it!  The pickle slices were too thick.
Jim:	 Hold it... Hold it... Hold it... Okay.
Jim:	 Now, too much mustard, see?
Martin:	 Oh, man!
SpongeBob:	 Am I a fraud?
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?
SpongeBob:	 Crying my eyes out.
Squidward:	 Well, hurry up. I gotta cry, too.
SpongeBob:	 Why, Squidward?
Squidward:	 Because when Jim leaves, I'll be stuck with you again!
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Squidward. Jim won't be leaving. He's taking my job. I'm the one who's leaving!
Squidward:	 Really?  Yes! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee, hee, Ha! Ha!
SpongeBob:	 The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills. I should be professional. I must... resign.  "Dear Mr. Krabs,"...
Mr. Krabs:	 Three cheers for the world's greatest fry cook... SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	  Me?
Mr. Krabs:	 Come here. Help us cheer for Jim.
All But Mr. Krabs and Squidward:	 Hip, hip, Hooray!
SpongeBob:	 Goodbye, grill. Goodbye, pot. Goodbye, pan. So long, fry fat. Goodbye, grease stain.  Goodbye, frozen patty #1. Goodbye, frozen patty #2.
Narrator:	 298 frozen patties later...
SpongeBob:	  Goodbye, freezer.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  That smells like a resignation letter.  SpongeBob's resignation? Oh, this is terrible! No one's making patties! And that mean I'm not making money!
Jim:	 Hey, Eugene, where's that little fry cook of yours?
Mr. Krabs:	 He thinks you're taking his job, so he's run off!
Jim:	 Hey, great idea! And you can give me a raise!
SpongeBob:	 Look at them. Mr. Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, I better go find him. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook.
Jim:	 What are you thinking, SpongeBob? I'm not taking your job.
SpongeBob:	 But you're the greatest fry cook in the world! The Krusty Krab deserves better than me.
Jim:	 Both those statements are true, SpongeBob, but there's a reason I left the Krusty Krab. It all started on a warm summer evening. Business was slow, so Squidward and I were having one of our famous bull sessions.  We should open our own restaurant if the jail is bulging now.
Squidward:	 No, thanks. I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off.
Jim:	 What if it never does? Don't you wanna have something to fall back on?
Squidward:	 Yeah! Ha! I could lose my beautiful, flowing hair, too, but I'm not buying a wig yet.
Jim:	 Well, while you go wig shopping, I'm gonna go talk to Mr. Krabs.  Hey, Mr. Krabs, you gotta second?
Mr. Krabs:	 Anything for you, Jimmy, me boy. Cop a squat and lay your wreck and tell me what's on your wig, Jim.
Jim:	 Cut the gas, Krabs, and dig this: I've been bustin' my conk for you. You better lay on some extra gravy, or I'm going to agitate the gravel.
Mr. Krabs:	 What now?
Jim:	 You know, lay a patch.
Mr. Krabs:	 'Scuse me?
Jim:	 Give me a raise, or I'm quitting.
Mr. Krabs:	 A raise? That's not in my "Hiptionary". Help me get with it, Jack.
Jim:	 Stop talking like that.
Mr. Krabs:	 These sideburns aren't real.
Jim:	 I need more money in my paycheck at the end of every week, capiche?
Squidward:	 My hair! My beautiful hair! My hair! My hair!
Mr. Krabs:	 Aye, it's still as funny today as it was then. 
Mr. Krabs:	 You see, SpongeBob, you've got one quality Jim will never have: you're cheap!
SpongeBob:	 Wow! I never thought about it that way!
Mr. Krabs:	 So, you'll stay?
SpongeBob:	 Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.
Jim:	 Well, Eugene, looks like you've got yourself another sucker. The kid's a good fry cook, but he'll only be a great fry cook when he finally gets the guts to quit this dump. Good luck, SpongeBob. You're gonna need it.
SpongeBob:	 The Krusty Krab isn't a dump.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, she's a dump, alright. But she's my dump.
SpongeBob:	 Oh.
