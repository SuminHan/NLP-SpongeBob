SpongeBob:	 Wake up, Gary.
Gary:	  Meow?
SpongeBob:	 We're moving today!
Gary:	  Meow?
SpongeBob:	 Yes, that's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants! 
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	  No more food.  Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells.  April Fools!  There ya go, pal!
Gary:	 Meow. 
SpongeBob:	  Whew, I'm thirsty!   This is an extreme thirst! 
SpongeBob:	 Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!  To me! 
Squidward:	 What's he so happy about?  April 1st?  April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday!  Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today. I caught something terrible.
Mr. Krabs:	  What'd you catch?
Squidward:	 I caught sight of the calendar.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, hold on Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.
Squidward:	 I have arrived.  What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?
Mr. Krabs:	 You just missed him.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, but he told us to tell you...
Squidward:	 Tell me what?
SpongeBob:	  He told me to tell you... April Fools.
Squidward:	  Well, it's been nice working here.  Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, wait!
Squidward:	 Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob:	 Wait, Squidward!  It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!
Squidward:	 You do?
SpongeBob:	 Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?
Squidward:	 Well, as long as it's not me.
Cora:	 Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?
SpongeBob:	 They're right here, lady! 
Cora:	  But this is a spoon.
SpongeBob:	 April Fools!  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?
Nat:	  Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob:	  Hey, what's that?
Nat:	 Well, I didn't see anything.  Hey, where'd that other guy go?
SpongeBob:	 April Fools! I'm right here!
Nat:	  Hey, that was pretty good.
Squidward:	 What are you doing behind the counter?
Tom:	 Excuse me, can I get a couple of ice cubes in here, please?
SpongeBob:	 Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up!  Here you go.
Tom:	 Thanks.  Huh?  Huh?  Ah.
SpongeBob:	  April Fools! 
Tom:	 What did you do to my drink?!
SpongeBob:	 I...  I... 
Tom:	 You what?!?!
SpongeBob:	 You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one! 
Tom:	 I guess that is pretty funny. 
SpongeBob:	  Hey, your shoes untied.  April Fools! You're not wearing shoes!  April Fools! 
Squidward:	 That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about! 
SpongeBob:	 Oh boy! Something for me to clean up! 
Squidward:	 April Fools! 
SpongeBob:	 Whooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!  Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl... 
All except Squidward:	 Oh, no.
SpongeBob:	 Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! 
Squidward:	  I'll catch you, SpongeBob!  Whoops.  April Fools, you little sausage!  SpongeBob! I was just kidding! Cmon, cmon. You all know I was just kidding… Right?
Martin:	 Aww, man, poor kid.
Shubie:	 That guy has definitely got some issues to work out. 
Tom:	 April Fools, jerk.
Squidward:	 Wait, don't go!
Man:	 Hey, you stink!
Squidward:	 Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh...  Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach.  Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo-  gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought.   SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob?  Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh… and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of… This isn't something I normally do so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am...  Patrick? What are you doing here?
Patrick:	 Digging.
Squidward:	 Why are you wearing that hat?
Patrick:	 Hmm, I don't know. 
Squidward:	  Where's SpongeBob?
Patrick:	 He's in the house. He's impressed.
Squidward:	 With what?
Patrick:	 I don't know, but it must have been pretty good to make him cry like that.
Squidward:	  SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there!  SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this! 
SpongeBob:	 What do you want?
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy. 
SpongeBob:	 What?
Squidward:	 I'm trying to say I'm  hee-haw-hee-haw!
SpongeBob:	 What?
Squidward:	 I'm just trying to say that I'm...  There's gotta be an easier way to do this.  Well, aren't you going to open it?
SpongeBob:	 I can't, I don't have a bottle opener. 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, I'm...  SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am...  ...sorry.  There you go.
SpongeBob:	 But I couldn't... 
Squidward:	 I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear! 
Patrick:	 It must have been pretty good to make him cry like that. 
Tom:	 April Fools...jerk. 
Mama Tentacles:	  You stink!
Squidward:	 Mother?  All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and... 
SpongeBob:	 Squidward! Is all that true?
Squidward:	 Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.
SpongeBob:	 Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
Squidward:	 What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.
SpongeBob:	 I promise.
Squidward:	 Really? 
All:	 April Fools!
Squidward:	  April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all! 
SpongeBob:	 What would we do without Squidward?
