Narrator:	 And now, Astrology with Squidward.
Squidward:	 Say hello to Pisces, sign of the fish. If you a Pisces, people don't trust you. That's because Pisceans tend to lie, all the time. Even when they think they're telling the truth, they're not. For the Pisces who wants to stop lying, I have simple advice: never talk again. My prediction for Pisces in the year ahead: your nose will keep working just fine. I'm your Nicktoon astrologer Squidward, reminding you that psychic will tell you good things, if you tip them well.
