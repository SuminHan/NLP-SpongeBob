Kelp Thing:	 Huh? Eh?
Narrator:	 It's Mermaid Man! Savior of the deep!  And his young fit servant, Barnacle Boy.
Mermaid Man:	 Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy...unite!  Kelp Thing, this is a posted, no-parking zone.
Kelp Thing:	 But I must do what I do.  Huh? 
Mermaid Man:	 Evil can't park here between the hours of 6:00am and 12:00pm! 
Club Leader:	 Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club members unite! 
All:	  Unite!
Club Leader:	 And now the second order of business: Drippy Brothers Studios is currently in production of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie!
All:	 Ooh!
SpongeBob:	 Oh boy, Patrick, I can hardly wait to see our favorite heroes on the big screen!
Club Leader:	 Third order of business, the special surprise guest!  The stars of the Mermaid Man movie are here tonight!  Directly from the set, here they are! 
Fake Mermaid Man:	 Hello, little heroes.
Patrick:	 Huh?
SpongeBob:	 You're not Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. You're fakes!
Fake Mermaid Man:	 Well, of course, we areâ€”we're actors.
SpongeBob:	 Actors? How can they make a Mermaid Man movie without the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Fake Mermaid Man:	 Listen, kid, this is an action movie. You're has-been heroes are too OLD for action.
SpongeBob:	 Mermaid Man is timeless!
Patrick:	 Yeah!
SpongeBob:	 I think I speak for everyone here when I say we won't stand for these two phony-baloney ruining the good name of our heroes. No right-minded Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy society member would ever pay to see this...this celluloid hoax. I say we boycott this movie! Now who's with me?  Traitors! Wait till we tell Mermaid Man about this. 
Announcer:	 B-47.
Mermaid Man:	 BONKO!
Barnacle Boy:	 It's "bingo". 
Mermaid Man:	 Get your hands off me, woman! 
Announcer:	 A-29.
SpongeBob:	  Too old for an action movie...huh.
Barnacle Boy:	 What is it this time, kid?
SpongeBob:	 Are you aware Drippy Brothers Studio is making the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie?
Barnacle Boy:	 They can't be making a movie about us!
SpongeBob:	 But they are! And they're using...  actors.
SpongeBob:	 They have shunned our heroes.
Patrick:	 And they weren't nice to them either.
Mermaid Man:	  Now our dreams of being big screen heroes will never come true.
SpongeBob:	 Well, that makes it even worse.
Barnacle Boy:	  You bet it does, kid.
Mermaid Man:	 And the worst part is I can't remember why I started crying. 
Patrick:	 Why don't we just make our own movie?
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, once again, you have exposed your brilliance. We'll make a real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie. Right here at Shady Shoals.
Mermaid Man:	  You will?
SpongeBob:	 Yes! And in doing so, we will right the wrong done to you by the evil Drippy Brother Studios and...  their actors.
Mermaid Man:	  Vindication is ours! Vindi...how did I get up here? 
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Patrick, what do we need to start a movie?
Patrick:	 Popcorn?
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick, to start making a movie.
Patrick:	 Oh, oh, oh...
SpongeBob:	 Let's start with...the title.
Patrick:	 Yeah, yeah. Ooh! I got one! "Adventures in the Underground City".
SpongeBob:	 Great, Pat, what happens?
Patrick:	 Well, there's a city...
SpongeBob:	  City...
Patrick:	 And it's underground...
SpongeBob:	  Underground...
Patrick:	 And they have an adventure...
SpongeBob:	  Adventure...
Patrick:	 The end.
SpongeBob:	 End.  That's great, Pat.  Hmm, seems kinda short.
Patrick:	 I have an idea. Let's make it longer!
SpongeBob:	 Longer, yes. Ok, let's have Mermaid Man get his face shrunk by Kelp-Thing's face minimizer. 
Patrick:	 Yeah, and then he...umm...he drinks...cheese coffee.
SpongeBob:	  Good one, Pat. 
Mr. Krabs:	  What are ye lads doing?
SpongeBob:	 We're making a movie.
Mr. Krabs:	 Great! I got cinema's newest star, right here.
SpongeBob:	 
Mr. Krabs:	 So, what do ye say, lad?
SpongeBob:	 Sure, Mr Krabs, Pearl can be in our movie.
Mr. Krabs:	 I wasn't talking about Pearl. I was talking about the Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob:	 You can be in it, too, Pearl.
Pearl:	  I'm gonna be a movie star. 
SpongeBob:	 Let's meet the highly skilled professionals who will help us fulfill your dream of being on the big screen. Sandy will handle the stunts and explosives. 
Sandy:	 Howdy.
SpongeBob:	 Pearl is the leading lady. Mr Krabs will cater the affair.
Mr. Krabs:	 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick will run the camera.
Patrick:	 Hey... 
SpongeBob:	 This is Squidward. He's in charge of the makeup department.
Squidward:	  Uh, no thanks. Who wants to be the 'makeup department'?
SpongeBob:	 Not makeup department, you're the makeup artist.
Squidward:	 Artist? 
SpongeBob:	 Makeup artist.
Squidward:	 Well then let's make those old crabapples sizzle.  Hmmm...  Time for the art-eest to go to work.  Voila!
SpongeBob:	 Ok, places everybody. Squidward, are our heroes ready?
Squidward:	 As they'll ever be.
SpongeBob:	  They're beautiful.  They look just like they did 30 years ago.  Ok...action!
Sandy:	 I love my new job.
SpongeBob:	 Good job, Sandy.
Plankton:	 Psst...  I, Man Ray, have returned from the murky depths to seek my revenge and banish your souls to the nether regions. Their defenses are strong, but they are no match for my Man Ray ray. 
SpongeBob:	 What are you doing?
Plankton:	 SpongeBob, this role was made for me.
SpongeBob:	 That villain isn't even in this movie. But let me see if we have something that fits your qualifications. Oh, here's something.  You can be the boom operator.
Plankton:	 I thought Sandy was the boom operator.
Sandy:	 Did somebody say boom?
Plankton:	 All right, SpongeBob, but you're squandering my talents.
SpongeBob:	 Ok, Patrick, start the movie!
Assistant:	 Take 1.
Mermaid Man:	 We have to get back to those swollen Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob:	 Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's "stolen Krabby Patties."
Assistant:	 Take 2.
Mermaid Man:	 We have to get back to those stolen naggie daddies.
SpongeBob:	 Cut! No, Mermaid Man, it's "stolen Krabby Patties."
Assistant:	  Take 5,003.
Mermaid Man:	 We have to get back to those stolen Krabby Patties! And if we don't stop that diabolical scoundrel- 
Plankton:	 Give it back!
Barnacle Boy:	 I knew this was a bad idea.
SpongeBob:	 Cut! Plankton, next time could you keep the boom out of shot? Other than that, you're doing a super job.
Plankton:	 This is humiliating. I'm not good at this boom thing.
Sandy:	 Did somebody say boom?
Pearl:	 Oh, daddy, you said I was going to be a star!
Mr. Krabs:	 You are, Pearl. Mermaid Man wouldn't be anywhere without you. Go out there and break a leg.
Pearl:	 Yeah! 
SpongeBob:	 Okay, action!
Mermaid Man:	 To the boat mobile. 
SpongeBob:	 Cue the sound effects. 
Mermaid Man:	 Listen to that engine purr. 
SpongeBob:	 Almost there! 
Patrick:	 Good morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Everything's ruined! Well, at least we got the footage.
Patrick:	 Yeah, I got the footage.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, what is that?
Patrick:	 Oh, it's a camera.
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick, this. 
Patrick:	 Oh, that's a lens cap.
SpongeBob:	 Did you just put that on?!
Patrick:	 Yup, I didn't want to lose it so I put it there right before we started filming.
SpongeBob:	   The movie's ruined! We can't make a movie.
Mermaid Man:	 Hey, little hero, this reminds me of the Episode 912. We were surrounded. The Kelp-Thing was to our right and there broccoli on the side. But if there was one thing I remember, it was how to forget.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, this is good. Roll the film.
Mermaid Man:	 The rain in Spain stays mainly on the...space! The final countdown. Stick to the...stick to the...Lou, my darling! Lou!  Now go out there and finish this movie, kid. 
SpongeBob:	 Mr Krabs, why are you weeping?
Mr. Krabs:	 I closed early for your movie. Where are the paying customers? You promised a full house.
SpongeBob:	 And here comes the filling!  The Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Fan Club. I knew you'd come to see the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie.
Club Leader:	 Actually, the real movie was sold out. I'll take 200 tickets, please. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Now, this is what I call a happy ending.
Barnacle Boy:	  Well, our big moment, us up on the big screen. 
SpongeBob:	  Fort Lox: home to over five billion Krabby Patties.  What evil mastermind would dare infiltrate this fortified fort and make off with its treasure?  It is I, Kelp-Thing! Do what I do!
Mermaid Man:	  Stop! You can't do that forbidden.
SpongeBob:	  Watch me!
Mermaid Man:	 Prepare to feel my wrath, you foul villain.  You may have won the Krabby Patties, but the battle rages on.  Mermaidmanacle Boy, unite! 
SpongeBob & Patrick:	  Yay! 
Mermaid Man:	 Well, kid, you showed the world that even though our steps may have been slowed, we still have a little action left in these heroic old bones. 
Barnacle Boy:	 Well, at least some of them.
