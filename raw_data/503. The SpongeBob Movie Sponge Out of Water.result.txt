Burger Beard:	 Aha!  "Booby Traps"?  Oh. There you are, my lovely.  What's that? Take the book? I don't mind if I do.  At last, it is mine. Finally, you are mine.  All right. Let's do this. Bare Knuckles.  Bring it on, skinny. You don't scare me.
Seagull #1:	 You got any sevens?
Seagull #2:	 Go fish.
Burger Beard:	 Is that all you got?!  Man, this is way overdue.  Once upon a time, under the sea, there was a little town called,  "Bikini Bottom."  In this town, there was a place called, [A CGI Krabby Patty is shown.][The scene cuts to the Kitchen of The Krusty Krab. The grill, counter next to the grill, and fryer are shown. Here, seven Krabby Patties are being grilled and fries are being cooked.][The scene shows a different angle of the same scene, where the fryer is the focus of the shot.][The scene shows a counter with a dispenser of ketchup, a stack of tomato slices, two tomatoes, a cut tomato with a slice, a jar of pickles, a head of lettuce with a few pieces cut off, a stack of onion slices, a pile of puns, a bag of potatoes, two whole onions, and a cut onion.][The scene cuts to a medium shot of the kitchen. Spat starts to descend into the shot.][SpongeBob pops in and his Krusty Krab hat and spatula fall to his head and hand, respectively.]
Seagull Crew:	 Oh...  ...who lives in a pineapple under  the sea?  SpongeBob  SquarePants! Absorbent  and yellow.
Burger Beard:	  Hold it. Just hold it.
Seagull Crew:	 SpongeBob SquarePants!  If nautical nonsense be something  you wish. SpongeBob SquarePants!  Then drop on the deck and  flop like a fish.  Sponge...  ...Bob Square...  ...Pants! [Another seagull lands on the third seagull. The scene cuts back to the shot of Burger Beard and the seagulls.]
Burger Beard:	  Stop!   There's only one thing worse than talking birds, and that would be... Singing Birds!
Seagull:	 Okay, I promise not to... ♪ sing! ♪
Skeleton Parrot #1:	 Take it from us.
Skeleton Parrot #2:	 He really does hate singing birds.
Kyle:	 Just keep weading. Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir.
Burger Beard:	 Come closer. Let me tell you the tale.
David:	 Okay, start reading.
Burger Beard:	 Not  close!  All right. Here we go.  Now, SpongeBob loved his job as a fry cook more than anything.  And that is saying a lot. Because he loved everything!  He loved his pet snail, Gary.  He loved his best friend, Patrick.   He loved blowing bubbles...  ...and jellyfishing.
SpongeBob:	 Whee! 
Burger Beard:	 He loved making Krabby Patties for the folks in Bikini Bottom.. ...just as much as they loved eating them.  "Why," you may ask, "do they love this greasy meal sandwich so much? Why did they eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner...  "...despite the doctor's warnings?"
Dr. Gill Gilliam:	  He'll be gone in a week.
Shubie:	 Oh, Harold! 
Burger Beard:	 Ah, it was a secret.  No one was sure what was in those patties that made them so delicious. And frankly, no one cared, except for Plankton. 
Plankton:	 Yeah. 
Burger Beard:	 Plankton owned a restaurant right across the street from the Krusty Krab, where no one ate...  ...because the food was really bad!
Plankton:	 Now, is that really necessary? 
Burger Beard:	  Plankton had made it his life's work to steal the recipe. 
Plankton:	 SpongeBob, please! Let's talk about this. 
Burger Beard:	 But SpongeBob was always there to protect it. But today...  ...things would be different.
Patrick:	 Good morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Morning, Patrick! Are you here for your pre-lunch Krabby Patty?
Patrick:	 I'm getting two today. One for me, and one for my friend.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, have I met this friend?
Patrick:	  You know me, SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob:	 Enjoy, Patrick's tummy. 
Mr. Krabs:	  13, 14, 15... 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Mr. Krabs, I thought we got our tartar sauce delivery on Thursday.
Mr. Krabs:	 Tartar...  ...sauce?
Plankton:	 Bullseye! 
SpongeBob:	 Plankton!
Mr. Krabs:	  So it's a food fight he wants, eh?
Plankton:	  Welcome to Air Plankton! Please put your seat backs and tray tables up as we're now approaching our final destination.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Patrick. Load the potatoes!
Patrick:	  Mashed or scalloped, sir?
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick: raw.
Patrick:	 Sir, yes, sir!  Locked and loading!
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't worry, little formula. You'll be safe in this...safe.  Fire!
Plankton:	 Potatoes?! 
SpongeBob:	 He's closing in!
Patrick:	  I think we have a few minutes before he gets here.  Huh?  He's right on top of us!
Sandals:	 Hey, it's raining fries!
Plankton:	 It's gonna take a lot more than potatoes to bring this baby down!  Or maybe not.
Patrick:	 Whoo!
SpongeBob:	 Wait a minute, Patrick. Look! He's got a tank!
Plankton:	 Well, Krabs, you're certainly in a pickle now!
Sandals:	 Hey, it's raining pickles!  Now, it's raining...  ...tanks!
Plankton:	 You're welcome. 
Patrick:	 Finland.
SpongeBob:	 Your order, sir.
Sandy:	 I'll have two Krabby Patties: extra ketchup, extra mustard, and hold the mayo.
SpongeBob:	 Wrong channel!   order, sir!
Mr. Krabs:	 Extra ketchup, extra mustard, HOLD THE MAYO!!
SpongeBob:	 Yes, sir!  Extra ketchup, extra mustard.
Patrick:	  Hold the mayo!
Mr. Krabs:	 Unleash the condiments.
SpongeBob:	 With relish.  Excuse me! 
Sandy:	  Hello? Hello?!  Guess ya'll don't want my money.
Mr. Krabs:	 Money?  Thank you. Come again. 
Patrick:	 I can't hold the mayo any longer! 
Plankton:	 Mayo?! Well, it's gonna take a lot more than mayo to stop- 
SpongeBob:	 Now what? 
Patrick:	 Uhh... I just remembered! I don't work for Mr. Krabs. 
SpongeBob:	 Robot! Robot! ROBOT! GIANT ROBOT! Robot! Robot!  Mr. Krabs! Plankton's here, and he's got a giant robot!
Mr. Krabs:	 Quick, boy! Bar the door!
SpongeBob:	  Got it! 
Plankton:	 I'll take one secret formula...  ...to go.  Oh, barnacles! I'm out of gas?  Well, I'm not through yet. I've got something that will make you hand over that formula: something you can't resist. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Money?!
Plankton:	 Yes.  That's...that's...that's impossible!  Well, it  full of money just last week. Then I bought that airplane, and built that tank-
Mr. Krabs:	 Sounds to me like someone's just a wee bit...broke!
Plankton:	  Well, Krabs, I guess you've won. I've spent every penny I've ever made trying to put you out of business...  ...except this one: my last penny.  Besides, what could I do with one measly cent, anyway?
Mr. Krabs:	 You could give it to me.  Just a suggestion.
Plankton:	  Here.  Take it!  You've taken everything else. Why not?! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, Plankton, like a reheated Krabby Patty, you've been foiled again! 
SpongeBob:	 I guess this means that the secret formula is safe forever. Right, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	  It sure does, boy.  Why don't you scurry along?  Thanks for coming! Have a nice day!  He's been out there crying for twenty minutes.  Pathetic.  I'm just gonna go out there and gloat a little. 
Plankton:	  Cyclops to Laptop. Come in, Laptop. 
Karen:	  Laptop.  You do realize that nickname is demeaning. I have twice the processing power of  a laptop. 
Plankton:	  Never mind. Maintain radio silence.  He-he, finally!  A pressure plate, eh, Krabs? Amateur hour.  Hmm...  Perfect.  Not a bad likeness.  Good enough to fool that idiot Krabs. Easy, easy. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Plankton's broke! Ooh-ooh! Plankton's broke! Ha-ha!
SpongeBob:	 Look at Mr. Krabs go! I've never seen him gloat this hard before.
Mr. Krabs:	  Well, Plankton, me bunions are telling me it's time to stop gloatin'.  Eh? Looks like you're falling apart at the seams.  Huh?
Plankton Robot:	 Poor me.  Sob, sob.
Mr. Krabs:	 A robot?!
SpongeBob:	  Plankton?
Plankton:	  Uh-oh.  That ain't good.
Computer Voice:	  Initiating Lockdown Sequence.
Mr. Krabs:	 Me formuler! 
Squidward:	 Huh?  Ow! 
Mr. Krabs:	  [the doors shut][starts to bang on the door]
Plankton Robot:	  Ha, ha! Victory dance! Booya!
SpongeBob:	 Give me that! 
Plankton:	 Come on, SpongeBob!  JOIN ME!! AND WE'LL BE RICH AND POWERFUL! ...  ...until I eventually betray you!  Uuh... JOIN ME!!
SpongeBob:	 No! Never! I'm on team Krabs for life!!
Mr. Krabs:	  
SpongeBob:	 What? Where'd it go?
Plankton:	  Wait a minute... Molecular deconstruction? I proved that to be a scientific impossibility 7 times!
SpongeBob:	  Wait a minute... I think I forgot to empty Gary's litter box today.
Mr. Krabs:	  Where's me formuler, Plankton?!
Plankton:	 I-I don't know! It just disappeared!
Mr. Krabs:	 Why should I believe you, ya lyin' liar?!
SpongeBob:	 Normally, I'd agree with you, Mr. Krabs, but this time, he's telling the truth! It just vanished!
Plankton:	 It's true!! 
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you! He's innocent!
Plankton:	 W-What are you gonna do, Krabs? Pour hot oil on me? Or put bamboo shoots under my nails?
Mr. Krabs:	 No. Knock-Knock.
Plankton:	 Knock-Knock jokes? I can do this all day, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Knock-Knock.
Plankton:	 Oh, boy. Who's there?
Mr. Krabs:	 Jimmy.
Plankton:	 Jimmy who?
Mr. Krabs:	 Jimmy BACK MY FORMULER, PLANKTON!!
Plankton:	 Well, that's stupid, but how is it torture?
Mr. Krabs:	  Hehehehe... You'll see. 
SpongeBob:	 Jimmy... Back my formula? Hmm. Ohhhhhhhhh!! I get it! 
Plankton:	  Oh, make it stop, Krabs! MAKE IT STOP!! 
Squidward:	  Mr. Krabs!  SpongeBob, zip it! 
Plankton:	 Oh, thank you, Squidward!
Squidward:	 The customers are getting restless. They're asking for...  refunds.
Mr. Krabs:	  Refunds?!  Listen up boy!  Get in there and make me customers some Krabby Patties! All right, Plankton...  SpongeBob! What's wrong, boy?  
SpongeBob:	 How can we make more Krabby Patties without the secret formula?!
Mr. Krabs:	 You've got to have that formuler memorized by now!
SpongeBob:	  But as you are aware sir,  the employee handbook clearly states and I quote,  "No employee may, in part or in whole, commit the Krabby Patty Secret Formula to any recorded, written, or visual form, including memories, dreams, and/or needle point." 
Mr. Krabs:	  Curse you, fine print!!
Mr. Krabs:	 STOP!!  I'm not your enemy!  Plankton is your enemy!
Squidward:	 So is he an anemone or Plankton?
Mrs. Puff:	  Well, someone had to do it.
SpongeBob:	 But...but, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	  He took  from you. 
Fred:	 A Krabby Patty.
Sandals:	 I can almost taste it.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, Plankton didn't take the secret formula.
Mr. Krabs:	  Not now, SpongeBob!
Patrick:	  Hey! I ordered a double Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs:	 So, join me. Help get the formuler back, and I'll give each and every one of ya a free Krabby Patty!  Oh, no, wait! Even better: a slight discount.  To the Chum Bucket!
SpongeBob:	  But he didn't do it.
Plankton:	  I had it right in my greedy little mits, and then: poof! And now it's gone. Gone forever! Oh, I was so close to gaining the people's respect/fear.
Karen:	 Um, Plankton?
Plankton:	 Oh, when will my frustration/humiliation end?
Karen:	 Plankton...
Plankton:	 Not now, Hun! I'm ranting/raving.  All right, what is it?
Karen:	 Well, I  trying to tell you there's an angry mob outside, but now they're inside!
Plankton:	 Oh... 
Karen:	  I...just work here.
Mr. Krabs:	  We'd like to have a word with you.
Plankton:	  You all look very hungry. Can I get anybody a Chumburger?
Mr. Krabs:	  Enough with that niceties, Plankton! This is the last time I'm gonna ask you. 
Plankton:	  I told you, Krabs! I don't have it!
Mr. Krabs:	 Wrong answer! 
SpongeBob:	 Stop! All right, Mr. Krabs. Let me get in on this. 
Plankton:	 What's going on around here?
SpongeBob:	  You may want to step back a little, Mr. Krabs. This could get messy.
Mr. Krabs:	 Let's hope so.
SpongeBob:	 So, you won't talk, eh, Plankton?  I didn't wanna have to do this. Plankton,...  ...here comes the pain!
Mr. Krabs:	 Soap in the eye, eh? Diabolical.
Plankton:	  No, stop, don't!
Mr. Krabs:	 Wait,  didn't look painful.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, you may not understand what I'm about to do today.  But someday, we'll look back and have a good laugh. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Wait a minute.
Customer:	 Hey, they're getting away!
SpongeBob:	 Sorry, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 So, you've been runnin' a long con on me, eh? All these years, you've been working for Plankton?!
Paco:	 They're in cahoots!
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah, I guess that's a short way of saying it. STOP THAT BUBBLE!
Customer:	 Please tell me there's something soft below me.
SpongeBob and Plankton:	 Uh, nope. 
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob!  Oh, you were like an underpaid son to me. I would have expected Squidward to stab me in the back! 
Squidward:	  Huh, what?
Mr. Krabs:	 But SpongeBob, me most trusted employee, working with me sworn enemy?  You know what this means, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward:	 We get the rest of the day off?
Mr. Krabs:	 No! This be but a harbinger of what I fear lies ahead. For you, for me, for all of Bikini Bottom! The Krabby Patty is what ties us all together! Without it, there will be a complete breakdown of social order! A war of all against all! Dark times are ahead! Dark times indeed! 
Squidward:	 Seriously?  Aren't you overreacting a bit? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Welcome to the apocalypse, Mr. Squidward. I hope you like leather. 
Squidward:	 I prefer suede.
Burger Beard:	 And so, Bikini Bottom became an apocalyptic cesspool forevermore. The end! 
Kyle:	 Wait a minute. That's a terrible ending!
David:	 Oh, this is bad.  bad! SpongeBob's in trouble, and the story's over?!
Andy:	 Ouch, Ouch, Ouch!
Henry:	 There is no way that that's the end of the story.
Burger Beard:	 Oh, of course it is. I'll show you. Just turn around.
Henry:	 Oh, all right.  Hey, I need that to fly, you jerk!
Burger Beard:	  The end! 
Henry:	 That's not the end.
Andy:	 You'd better keep reading, Mr. Pirate,...  ...or else!
Henry:	  I know I shouldn't be littering, but that ending was rubbish! 
Patrick:	  Good morning, Squidward. I'll have the usual.  With cheese.
Squidward:	 We're out of Krabby Patties right now!
Patrick:	  No Krabby Patties?  NOOOO!!
SpongeBob:	  Look what's become of Bikini Bottom. We've really gotta get that formula back.
Plankton:	 Hmm... Get the secret formula, you say? Excuse me, I...need a moment. With that formula, I could rule the world! 
SpongeBob:	 You know I can hear you, right?
Plankton:	 Well, what do we do now?
SpongeBob:	 Now we work together. You know, teamwork.
Plankton:	 What's a te-amwork?
SpongeBob:	 No, Plankton, teamwork.
Plankton:	 Te-amwork.
SpongeBob:	 Teamwork.
Plankton:	 Tie 'em work.
SpongeBob:	 Teamwork.
Plankton:	 Tie 'em up.
SpongeBob:	 Say "team" like a sports...
Plankton:	 Team.
SpongeBob:	 Team. Now say "work."
Plankton:	 Work.
SpongeBob:	 Put 'em together, what do you got?
Plankton:	 Time bomb... work.
SpongeBob:	 Gettin' better.
Johnny:	  Now, Bikini Bottom action news!
Sandy:	  Oh! Hey, Patrick!
Patrick:	 Come on, tummy. It's gonna be a long day.
Johnny:	  We interrupt your regular program for an important news bulletin!
Perch Perkins:	  Perch Perkins reporting live from Downtown Bikini...  ...Bottom. Complete chaos here today as our town attempts to deal with a sudden and complete shortage of Krabby Patties.  Whoa! Events here have this reporter wondering, what  the secret ingredient in Krabby Patties, anyway?! 
Fish:	 It's love!! The secret ingredient is love!! 
Sandy:	 No more Krabby Patties? If I'd known that, I'd have chewed it slower. Huh?  What the corndog is that?! 
SpongeBob:	 Come on, Plankton, it's easy, It means I help you, you help me, and when we accomplish our goal, then we do hands in the middle.
Plankton:	 Hands in the middle? No, no, sounds idiotic. Besides, the two of us are no match for that cranky mob.  We could probably use a few more... te-am-works.
SpongeBob:	 That's exactly what I was thinking. 
Plankton:	 Wait, what are you doing?
Patrick:	  I...need...Krabby Patties!
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick:	  I...need...Krabby Patties!  Vandalizing stuff.
Plankton:	 Isn't that your house?
Patrick:	 Hey, what's with all the questions? Who are you guys?
SpongeBob:	 It's me, your best friend, SpongeBob.
Patrick:	 Oh, yeah. Well, if you're SpongeBob, then what's the secret password?
SpongeBob and Plankton:	 Uhh...
Patrick:	 Correct! It  you! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick!
Patrick:	 SpongeBob! Why aren't you at the Krusty Krab making Krabby Patties? 
SpongeBob:	 Well, I'd love to, but the formula's gone.
Patrick:	 Yeah, Mr. Krabs says you and Plankton took it.
SpongeBob:	 No, that's not what happened. It just disappeared. We're putting a team together to find it.
Patrick:	 A team? Oh, oh, pick me, pick me, pick me!
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Patrick, you're in.
Plankton:	 I don't know, SpongeBob.  What exactly does this clown bring to the te-am?
SpongeBob:	 He brings loyalty, Plankton, loyalty. Isn't that right, Patrick?
Patrick:	 Yeah, yeah, loyalty. I'VE GOT SPONGEBOB! HE'S OVER HERE! 
Mr. Krabs:	 LET'S GO GET HIM!! 
Plankton:	 Come on, SpongeBob. Let's get out of here!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick-  Patrick, why are you doing this?
Patrick:	 BECAUSE I...NEED...KRABBY...PATTIES!! Hurry up! I'm hungry! Over here!  Guys? Am I still on the team?  Hey, what are you looking at?
SpongeBob:	 Sandy!  Sandy?  Sandy. Sandy, are you home? Gee, Plankton, I wonder where she is. What is all this stuff?  Sandy? 
Sandy:	  Don't touch that! 
SpongeBob:	 Sandy, are you okay?
Sandy:	   Have you looked outside? Does that seem okay to you? I'm trying to figure out what happened to society. If we don't fix it soon, there won't be anything left to fix! 
SpongeBob:	 Sandy! The lack of Krabby Patties has driven her mad.
Sandy:	 And I think I figured it out. Look!  When this came down from above, I knew it could only mean one thing.
SpongeBob:	 And that would be?
Sandy:	 It means it's THE END! The sandwich gods are angry with us!
SpongeBob and Plankton:	 Sandwich gods?
Sandy:	 I just don't know how we're going to appease them! 
Plankton:	 You got any other friends who aren't dim bulbs and nut jobs?
SpongeBob:	 Well, I have one friend who's loyal to the very end.  Gary, I'm home.  Gare bear?  Gary? Gary?  Huh?
Plankton:	 Revolting!
SpongeBob:	 But it means Gary is close by. Gary, I'm back! Whoa.  Oh, hey, Gary. Plankton and I need you to help us find the Krabby Patty formula and fix Bikini Bottom.
Gary:	 
SpongeBob:	 What do you mean you don't have to do as I say anymore?
Gary:	 
SpongeBob:	 What do you mean king of snails? Gary the Snail, you get down here right now and join this team.
Gary:	 
SpongeBob:	 What do you mean seize them? 
Plankton:	 Why are you running?
SpongeBob:	 Because they're right on our tail.  Oh, right, snails.
Plankton:	 Well, so much for your te-am.
SpongeBob:	 Putting together a team is a lot harder than I thought it would be.
Mr. Krabs:	 This way!
Plankton:	 We better get out of here until things cool off. 
SpongeBob:	  Everything we know and love has been destroyed.
Plankton:	 Well, yeah, looks like they're gonna have to change the name of Bikini Bottom to Dirty Bottom  right SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 That's kinda gross, Plankton.
Plankton:	 Yeah, yeah, too soon, huh?
SpongeBob:	 This feels like it really is the end.
Plankton:	 Don't worry, SpongeBob. We'll find the secret formula and everything will go back to the way it was. You know, all happy and junk.  Now let's try and get some sleep.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, I guess you're right. 
Plankton:	 There you are, feel comfy?
SpongeBob:	 You know, Plankton? I think you might know a little bit more about teamwork than you lead on.
Plankton:	 Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Good night, Plankton. 
Plankton:	  Good night, indeed.  That's right SpongeBob, sleep. You're hiding that formula in there somewhere.  Huh?  Well, here goes nothing.  Huh? What... is this place? 
Ice Cream Boy:	 Fudge fight!  It's all over me.
Plankton:	 Ew! It's so sweet in here. I think my eyeball is getting a toothache.
Popsicle Twins:	 Hello, Plankton. Come and play with us  Hurry.  Before we melt. 
Giant Fluffy Cat:	 Meow.
Plankton:	 So much sweetness! I think I'm gonna be sick.  Huh?
Rainbow:	 Daddy!
SpongeBob:	 Plankton? Oh, Plankton, I just had the craziest dream, and you were in it.
Plankton:	 I'm sure it was nothing.  Now, go back to sleep.
SpongeBob:	 Were you in my brain?
Plankton:	 What? No! That's crazy talk!
SpongeBob:	 Then why is there cotton candy on your antennae?
Plankton:	 Because uh... because uh... okay, fine, I was in your brain.
SpongeBob:	  What were you doing in there?
Plankton:	 What do you think I was doing? Looking for the secret formula.
SpongeBob:	 What?
Plankton:	 Don't act so innocent! You know what I was up to. That's why you're pretending not to know the formula.
SpongeBob:	 I'm not pretending. I can't believe you thought I was lying.
Plankton:	 Hey, don't take it personally, I just assume everyone is lying.
SpongeBob:	 That is a horrible way to live your life.
Plankton:	 Whatever.
SpongeBob:	 It is. And if we're gonna be on the same team--
Plankton:	 MAYBE I DON'T WANNA BE ON A TE-AM! YOU THINK OF THAT?!
SpongeBob:	 But, Plankton, everything's better when you're part of a team. 
Plankton:	 You're not gonna start singing, are you?  Oh, brother.
Plankton:	 All right, you can put me down  Well,  that's one minute of my life I'll never get back.
SpongeBob:	 Not without a time machine.
Plankton:	 Wait a minute, hold that thought.  Now back up.
SpongeBob:	 Enihcam emit a tuohtiw ton.
Plankton:	 Slow down.
SpongeBob:	  Not without a time machine.
Plankton:	 Hmm. Yes.  SpongeBob, you're a genius!
SpongeBob:	 I am?
Plankton:	 If we build a time machine, we can go back to before the formula disappeared. Before society broke down. Before we became the hunted.
SpongeBob:	 That sounds great, Plankton, but how do we build a time machine?
Plankton:	 Well, first we'll need a computer powerful enough to calculate the intricacies of time travel.
SpongeBob:	 Where would we get one of those?
Plankton:	 Hmm.  There she is, my computer wife. They've got her tied up in the back room. I've never seen this many people at The Chum Bucket.
SpongeBob:	 I've never seen  there.
Plankton:	 Now was that really necessary?
SpongeBob:	 'Cause the food's really bad.
Plankton:	 Oh, come on, really?
SpongeBob:	 Shh!  How are we gonna sneak past those guards?
Plankton:	 Hmm.
Fish:	 Well, what do we have here? 
SpongeBob:	 We better hurry. Those guys really hate tires. 
Plankton:	  We'll never get in, the door's locked. 
SpongeBob:	 Hmm. Wait. The window is open. Come on, Plankton, it's time for some teamwork. Give me a boost.
Plankton:	  Okay. Wait a minute. No!
Plankton:	  Ya there? 
SpongeBob:	 Just a little higher, Plankton. Plankton? 
Plankton:	 Why don't  boost  up instead?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, yeah, good thinking. 
Plankton:	 Come on, SpongeBob, come on. 
SpongeBob:	 We're in. 
Plankton:	  There's a guard over there, camera pans to show Patrick sleeping on a chair]  [Plankton sneaks over while mildly loud notes are played, Patrick yawns while changing his sleeping position. The notes are heard again, then the scene shows SpongeBob playing a tiny piano]  [whispering] 
SpongeBob:	  Sorry. 
Plankton:	 Now just reach over and grab it. 
Patrick:	  What? Huh? Who goes there? 
Plankton:	 Stop! Pull it over his head!
SpongeBob:	 Oh. 
Plankton:	  Stop. Stop. Stop!  Let me get up there.  Help me.
SpongeBob:	 
Patrick:	 What? Huh?! 
SpongeBob:	 No! Plankton, help!  I'll rock him, you tell him a bedtime story.
Plankton:	 Uh, uh. Once upon a time, there was a big, fat, pink idiot who went to sleep. The end!
Patrick:	 Nice try, but it's gonna take more than that to-- 
Karen:	 I told you, I don't have the formula, you monsters.
Plankton:	 Hey, baby, how are you?
Karen:	 Plankton! My hero! You must need something, otherwise you wouldn't have come back.
SpongeBob:	 Plankton has a plan to save Bikini Bottom. 
Karen:	 Doesn't matter, Plankton. Krabs knows all your plans. He's been through my hard drive looking for the secret formula.
Plankton:	 Eh, I never had it, but we're going to get it. We're gonna go back in time and steal the formula before it disappeared.
Karen:	 Time travel. Where are you gonna find a computer that can do that? Wait a minute.
SpongeBob:	 I've never carried a head before.
Plankton:	 You'll get used to it.
SpongeBob:	 It's still warm. 
Fish:	 So you won't talk, huh? Let some air out of it. 
SpongeBob:	  Is this where we're gonna build our time machine?
Plankton:	  Sure. It's got everything we need. A photo booth, a cuckoo clock,  some day old chips. Now all we have to do is build it.  Oh, no, you don't.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, my pitch pipe.
Plankton:	 Uh, I need it for the time machine.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, okay. 
Plankton:	  Installed!  I did it!
SpongeBob:	 No.  did it.
Plankton:	 Wait. We  do it. As a te-am.
SpongeBob:	 A .
Plankton:	 Whatever.
SpongeBob:	  Okay, now for the brains. 
Karen:	 Okay, Plankton, this is it. It's gonna take all my processors and energy to power this time machine. So, if you have anything you wanna tell me, you better tell me now.
Plankton:	 Well, Karen. I know I've taken you for granted all these years and I... I just wanted to say... I'm glad you're on my te-am.
Karen:	 Oh, Sheldon. That's the sweetest thing you've ever s-- 
SpongeBob:	 Plankton, are you crying?
Plankton:	  No, no, no, it's just one of the hazards of having a giant eyeball.  There's always stuff getting in there. Anyway,  where were we?  Say "cheese."
SpongeBob:	  Cheese!
Plankton:	 According to my calculations, the Krusty Krab should be right here.
SpongeBob:	 What's that over there?
Future Patrick:	 SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Patrick?
Future Patrick:	 Is it really you?
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Patrick. It's--
Future Patrick:	 Finally! The Great Krabby Patty Famine is over!
SpongeBob:	 Great Krabby Patty Famine? Oh, what year is this?
Future Patrick:	 It's Thursday.
Plankton:	 According to my calculations, we've only gone 4 days into the future.
SpongeBob:	 Where is everybody?
Future Patrick:	 They all gave up on you but not me! 'Cause I'm not very smart.
SpongeBob:	 Where is the Krusty Krab?
Future Patrick:	 Right where it's always been. 
SpongeBob:	 I think we may be lost in time, Plankton. Maybe we should ask this guy for directions. Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us when we are?
Bubbles:	 Who dares disturb the one who watches?
SpongeBob:	 The one who watches? Your name is "The one who watches"?
Bubbles:	 No! My true name is "Bubbles."
Plankton:	 "Bubbles"?  Wha-what kind of a name is "Bubbles"?
Bubbles:	 It is my ancient dolphin name.
SpongeBob:	 So what's a dolphin doing out here in the middle of space?
Bubbles:	 My kind have been watching and protecting the galaxy for--  Hmm. 10,000 years.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, so you're the one keeping the meteors from hitting us.
Bubbles:	 Yes, I am. And I could really do with a potty break, would you mind keeping an eye on things?
SpongeBob:	 Sure thing but uh, what am I keeping my eye on? 
Plankton:	 What are you doing?
SpongeBob:	  I'm watching.
Plankton:	 We don't even know what we're even watching for.
SpongeBob:	 Maybe we should split up the work load.  You watch the one with the big red eye,  and I'll watch the one with the ringy thingies, like a team. 
Plankton:	 Okay, mine's moving.
SpongeBob:	 Mine, too.
Plankton:	 No, this doesn't seem right. Should we call Bubbles?
SpongeBob:	 Let's give him a minute. He's been holding it for 10,000 years.  I'm pretty sure that wasn't supposed to happen.  Come on, Plankton we gotta clean this up before Bubbles gets back! 
Bubbles:	  Much better, yes. You two are free to go.  What happened to Saturn and to Jupiter?!  You were supposed to--  keep them from smashing into each other.
SpongeBob:	 Sorry.
Bubbles:	 Now--  I am going to lose my job! And you... will lose your lives. 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, quarter me! 
Past SpongeBob:	  Plankton?!
Past Plankton:	 SpongeBob!
Past SpongeBob:	  Plankton?! 
Past Plankton:	 SpongeBob?! Who are you two supposed to be?
Plankton:	 I'm you from the future.
SpongeBob:	  And I'm  from the future!
Past Plankton:	 So you traveled back through time to help me? Great thinking!
SpongeBob:	 Nope. He's helping me.
Past SpongeBob:	  But he's the enemy.
SpongeBob:	  the enemy. Now we're a team.
Past Plankton:	 What, a te-am?
Plankton:	 A team! All right, go get the formula. 
Past SpongeBob:	 What have I become?
SpongeBob:	 All right, Plankton. 
Past SpongeBob:	 Do you have flying boat mobiles in the future?
Plankton:	 We only came back from the day after tomorrow, dim wit.
Past SpongeBob:	 Are there rocket packs?
SpongeBob:	 
Past SpongeBob:	 Did they outlaw clothes in the future?
Plankton:	 No!
Past SpongeBob:	 Then why are you naked?
Plankton:	 'Cause they don't make clothes in my size.
SpongeBob:	 Hold still you! 
Past SpongeBob:	 If you're from the future, what am I gonna say next?
Plankton:	 Something moronic?
Past SpongeBob:	 Wow!
Plankton:	 Hey, hurry up over there!
Past Plankton:	  Uh oh, that ain't good.
Computer Voice:	  Initiating Lockdown Sequence.
Plankton:	 Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get outta here.
SpongeBob:	  Got it!
Plankton:	 Come on! 
SpongeBob and Plankton:	 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, that was crazy.
Plankton:	 So  what teamwork is. All those years, I tried to make you mine and I finally did it. I mean,  did it!
Burger Beard:	 And so, it would seem that our heroes have accomplished all they had set out to do. 
Andy:	 Now that's an ending.
Seagull:	 Woohoo!
Kyle:	 Andy, cue the music.
Andy:	  ♪ Ooooh... ♪ 
Burger Beard:	 Oh, no. That's not the end.
Kyle:	 So, you mean the ending might be even happier? 
Burger Beard:	 Land ho!
Burger Beard:	 Yeah! All right, you feathered rats, time to shove off!
Andy:	 What? Why?
Burger Beard:	 Well, I can't have you pooping all over my restaurant, can I?
Andy:	 Restaurant? I thought this was a pirate ship.
Burger Beard:	 Oh, it . But it is also...  A-ha! My very own food truck.
Seagull #1:	 A what?
Burger Beard:	 Uh, you know, a restaurant on wheels.
Seagull #2:	 Like a garbage truck?
Andy:	 Hmm.
Burger Beard:	 No! Are you trying to scare away my customers?
Seagull #3:	 Well, we're not leaving until we see how the story ends.
Burger Beard:	 No problem. You guys like a little snack while you wait?
Seagull #3:	 Sure I'll take a curdled milk.
Andy:	 How 'bout a fish head?
Seagull #3:	 And a french fry covered in sand.
Burger Beard:	  Who wants some hot wings?
Andy:	 Wait a minute. Where's Kyle?
Burger Beard:	 Which one of you is next? 
Seagull:	 You're crazy, man! You're crazy! 
Kyle:	  Bye-bye, Mr. Poop. Now I can get my golden sticker.  Oh, hey, Mr. Piwate. I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
Burger Beard:	  Boo!
Kyle:	  I can't fly without my feathers. 
Cab driver:	 Where to, Mac?
Kyle:	 Just dwive.
Patrick:	 Uhh... Squidward?
Squidward:	 Still out of Krabby Patties.
Patrick:	  Does anyone have a picture of ketchup? 
Sandy:	 I done figured it out!  We have angered the sandwich gods and only a sacrifice will appease them!
Big Fish:	 Oh, that sounds reasonable.
Sandy:	 Soon, our post-apoca-whatchamacallit will be over and Krabby Patties will rain down from above!
Mr. Krabs:	 Rain down? Well that's no good! How will I get me money?!
Nat:	 Oh, you don't like that idea? Then we'll sacrifice 
SpongeBob:	 It's not a good idea to have a sacrifice on an empty stomach.  Who wants a Krabby Patty? 
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, is that me formuler?  Oh, happy day.  I've missed you so much. Where was it? Where'd you find it?
SpongeBob:	 Well, Plankton and I built a time machine out of an old photo booth and then we added--
Patrick:	 Cheese!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, wait! 
Mr. Krabs:	 It's okay, everyone. The post-apocalypse is almost over!  Ain't that right SpongeBob?  "Eugene, Eat my sub-aquatic air bubbles. Love, Plankton?" 
Plankton:	  You grabbed the wrong bottle!
SpongeBob:	  I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 That's okay, SpongeBob. We'll just have to sacrifice the two of you then! Prepare them for the sacrifice!
Patrick:	  I bring a message from the dawn of time!
SpongeBob:	 What is it, Patrick?
Patrick:	 Run! 
Squidward:	 Squidasaurus Rex!
SpongeBob:	 Well, Plankton, I guess we failed to accomplish our goals.
Plankton:	 
SpongeBob:	 But, even failure hurts a little less when you do it as a team, right?
Plankton:	  
SpongeBob:	 My fault?!
Plankton:	 You're the one who stole the wrong secret formula.
SpongeBob:	 I didn't know there were two bottles.
Plankton:	 Of course you didn't! 'Cause you got cotton candy for brains!  No, seriously, he really does.
SpongeBob:	 Well, we wouldn't even be in this mess in the first place if you weren't so selfish and evil!
Plankton:	 I  selfish and evil until you ruined everything with your teamwork!
SpongeBob:	  You take that back!
Plankton:	 YOU ARE THE WORST TEAMMATE EVER!!
SpongeBob:	  NO! 
Customer:	 Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing garbage and recycling!
SpongeBob:	  Look at me. Why, I've become like all of you. Savage. Fear-ridden. Selfish. An entire town of formerly good citizens, turned into heartless freaks, bent on their own self-prever...Self-preter...
Mob Member:	 "Preservation?"
SpongeBob:	 Yes! We've become alienated from each other. Each one an island unto himself, concerned only with ourselves. And in the name of all fishhood, I am not about to let that happen!  And so, if a sacrifice is needed to restore Bikini Bottom to its former glory...  then I am willing to take one for the team! 
Squidward:	 (gloats) You heard him!
Mr. Krabs:	 Let the sacrifice begin!
Squidasaurus Rex:	  And I thought my friends were primitive.
Mr. Krabs:	  Don't cry, me boy. Everything's gonna be fine. For us.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I'm not crying, Mr. Krabs.  I smell Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs:	 That's right. Keep thinking happy thoughts. Now!  The boy's right. 
Fred:	 My leg!
Mr. Krabs:	 I smell 'em, too. Ok SpongeBob, Go Get It! 
Squidward:	 Wait. You mean we can just take this stuff off? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Go find that Krabby Patty! 
SpongeBob:	  Come on, everybody! I've got some Krabby Patty orders to fill!  It's coming from over there!  Come on, guys! I think it's just over this hill! 
Squidward:	 How do you expect us to go up to the surface? We won't be able to breathe!
Customer:	 All right. All secondary characters, come with me. 
Squidward:	 Yeah, I'm with you guys. 
Mr. Krabs:	 No way, Squidward.  You're going up there with us.
Patrick:	 My feet hurt.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, you don't have feet.
Patrick:	  Well, it's not fair. You have feet. Sandy has feet. Squidward has feet.
Squidward:	 Actually, I have four feet. 
SpongeBob:	 It's not about feet. 
Squidward:	 What  it about then?
SpongeBob:	 It's about being a team and sticking together no matter what. 
Squidward:	 The only way we're going up there is if some fairy godmother shows up and helps us breathe air. 
SpongeBob:	 Bubbles!
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, you know this guy?
SpongeBob:	  Don't hurt us! We're sorry we got you fired!
Bubbles:	 Hurt you?  Why, I traveled back through time to thank you. I've been stuck in that job for eons. I needed a change, but I was too afraid to go for it.
SpongeBob:	 Well, Bubbles, I'm glad we could help.
Bubbles:	 Now, it is  turn to help. I can get you safely to the surface. Now--  Quick, all of you. Get in my mouth.
SpongeBob:	 Come on, guys. Let's go.
Squidward:	 There's no way I'm climbing into some dolphin's mouth.
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah, this guy just wants a free lunch.
SpongeBob:	 Guys, if Bubbles has the courage to quit his dead end nowhere job and travel back through time to help us, then we need to have the courage to-- 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, I never thought I'd be eaten by a dolphin.
SpongeBob:	 No, if he was eating us, he'd be chewing us up and we'd be going down there. This is what you call "riding in style."
Squidward:	  Not a lot of leg room in here.
Patrick:	 Well, maybe if you didn't have four feet!
Plankton:	  Note to self: Never stow away in a gym sock.
Patrick:	 What's happening? I feel tingly.
Squidward:	 Ow, my neck.
Bubbles:	 I've done all I can. The rest is up to you.
SpongeBob:	  Thank you, Bubbles!
Bubbles:	 Farewell, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	  Farewell, Bubbles!
Bubbles:	 Now, to update my--  Hmm-m-m  R-r-résumé! 
Sandy:	  Ah, fresh air. Oh, how I've missed you.
Squidward:	 Ugh! This place smells awful!
SpongeBob:	 Come on, guys. Let's get the Krabby Patty formula and save Bikini Bottom.  Whoa. What is this place?
Mr. Krabs:	 I have a bad feeling about this.
Patrick:	  Maybe this guy knows where we are. He looks smart. He's got five heads.
SpongeBob:	  Uh, Sir? Could you tell us where to find a Krabby Patty? 
Patrick:	 Hey, my friend's talking to you! 
SpongeBob:	  What?  A giant, hairy porpoise! It's beached! It's suffering. Poor thing.
Sandy:	 Y'all, those aren't porpoises.
Mr. Krabs:	 All hands on deck!
Sandy:	 Oh, brother.
Mr. Krabs:	 We need to get these guys back in the water!
SpongeBob:	 Come on, push!
Mr. Krabs:	 Put your back into it!
SpongeBob:	 Come on, push! 
Squidward:	 Well, I guess this is where that horrible smell was coming from.
Beach girl:	  Whoa!
SpongeBob:	 Excuse me, do you know where we can get a Krabby Patty around here?
Beach boy:	 Invaders!
SpongeBob:	 Uh-oh!
Beach boy:	 You get off of my sister's sand castle! 
Beach girl:	 Mom! 
Patrick:	  Ahh...Where have you been all my life? 
Squidward:	  Whoa! Whoa!
Female Sunbather:	  Oh Frank...that's so good.
Patrick:	 
Freckled Boy:	 Gross! 
Patrick:	 Oh, hey Squidward.
Squidward:	 
SpongeBob:	  Sandy! The Krabby Patty! I think I see where it's coming from! 
SpongeBob and Sandy:	 WHOOOOOOOOAAAAAA!!!!!!! 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, you would not believe the size of the ice creams here. [Squidward strides up] I wonder what other giant snacks they have.  Cotton candy!
SpongeBob:	  Wow.
Sandy:	 If you ate all that, you'd have enough energy to run around the whole world.
Squidward:	 [annoyed by their laughing] Ugh! When is the sugar gonna wear off?
SpongeBob:	 Hey guys. I smell Krabby Patties!  I think it's this way!  Now what?
Squidward:	 We're never gonna make it!
SpongeBob:	 We're doing it guys!
Sandy:	 Hold on!
Squidward:	 SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 [gasps] Lean!
Mr. Krabs:	 What the--?
SpongeBob:	 What? "Home of the Krabby Patty?" But the Krusty Krab is the home of the Krabby Patty! Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?!
Mr. Krabs:	  $8.99 for a Krabby Patty?! Why didn't I think of that?  You.  Cease and desist that unauthorized patty flippin'!
SpongeBob:	 Yeah. That's my job!
Burger Beard:	 How did you get here? You cannot breathe air.
SpongeBob:	 Well, there was this magical dolphin from the future who shot us out of his blowhole and then--
Burger Beard:	  Wait! Wait.  That's not in the book.
Mr. Krabs:	 Book?
Burger Beard:	 There's no magical dolphin in this story.
Mr. Krabs:	 What story?
Burger Beard:	  The story of how Bikini Bottom was brought to its knees when its beloved Krabby Patty formula was stolen by me, Burger Beard.
Patrick:	  How does it end?
Burger Beard:	 Well, let me see. It looks like, um, Burger Beard becomes the richest food truck proprietor in all of the land.
SpongeBob:	 But how did you steal the formula?
Burger Beard:	 That was easy. I simply rewrote the story and...  Poof!
Mr. Krabs:	  Me formuler!
Squidward:	 What do you mean rewrote the story?
Burger Beard:	 Watch this.  The brave and handsome Burger Beard banished...  our poor heroes to be stranded on Pelican Island!  The end! 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, this looks bad! And these guys look hungry!  Look out! 
Squidward:	 Nice. So this is what teamwork gets you.
Mr. Krabs:	 Here. Take Squidward, you vile beasts!
Patrick:	 I wanna be on a new team. This one's broken. 
SpongeBob:	 Sandy, you're smart.  You have any ideas?
Sandy:	 I ain't been too smart since I found this old piece of paper! 
SpongeBob:	 What?
Mr. Krabs:	 Incoming!
SpongeBob:	 [he jumps and plucks a feather from a passing pelican and lands][Squidward inks off-screen]
Squidward:	  [embarrassed] It happens when I'm nervous. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Whatever you're gonna do, make it quick! They're closing in on us! 
SpongeBob:	 I'm gonna write us an ending. 
Patrick:	 Will it be a happy ending?
SpongeBob:	 It's gonna be super-powered! 
Plankton:	  I'll show  a happy ending. 
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	  Da-da-da-daa!
SpongeBob/Incvincibubble:	 Patrick!
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	 Huh?  Hey, I got feet!
Customer:	  Ugh... what is in these things? 
SpongeBob/Incvincibubble:	  We'll take one secret formula...  ...to go.  Clear the area, citizens. There is going to be some serious...  ...aft-kicking here. 
Burger Beard:	 But... I banished you.
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Sour Note? 
Kyle:	 My tiny little eardrums!
Burger Beard:	  Hey, hey, wait! Hold on! Hold on! Wait! Wait! Customers!  
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Mr. Superawesomeness, take him down.
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	  Mmmmmmm! [giggles]
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Uhh, Maybe we should have picked a better superpower for you, Patrick. 
Burger Beard:	 Let's see you get out of this one! 
Mr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot:	 Ka-ching! 
SpongeBob/Invinibubble:	 Get ready for the Invincibubble! 
Burger Beard:	 NO! My book!
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 All right, team. Time for hands in the middle!
Mr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot:	 Yes! Huh?  Oh yeah. 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Great job, guys, we did it! 
Patrick:	 Huh? 
Sandy/The Rodent:	 What? 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Sandy? Is that you?
Sandy/The Rodent:	 You can call me The Rodent! Hi-yah! 
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness :	 Hey. Where'd the pirate go?
Squidward/Sour Note:	  Hmm. Uh... 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Hmm. It looks like Burger Beard forgot the first rule of mobile fry-cooking: Always batten down your grease traps.
Mr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot:	 Follow that grease, team! 
Burger Beard:	  There she blows. 
Burger Beard:	  Oh no, you don't. 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Whoa!  HE'S AFTER THE BOOK! Sandy, use your squirrel powers!
Sandy/The Rodent:	 Roger that! 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Oh, she's never gonna make it!  Huh? Everyone lean! 
Andy:	 That's what you get.
Burger Beard:	  Come here.
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 The book! Sour Note! 
Burger Beard:	 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 All right, Burger Beard, prepare to be teamworked!
Burger Beard:	 I'm going to scrub my armpits with you.
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Uh, I don't get it.
Squidward/Sour Note:	 Because you're a sponge.
Burger Beard:	 Duh.
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Oh. Get him, The Rodent!
Sandy/The Rodent:	 Consider him roasted!  Huh?  Aw, nuts, I'm all out of nuts! 
Patrick/Mr. Suerawesomenesss:	 Justice is best...soft served. 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Patrick, I should have never doubted your powers!
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	  I can't think of a sweeter way to go. 
Burger Beard:	  Ha! It's all MINE! 
Mr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot:	 Not so fast, Booger Beard!  Me formuler.  Huh?
Burger Beard:	  This will make you feel a little butter.
Mr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot:	  Not melted butter! 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Mr. Krabs! 
Burger Beard:	 !
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Uh-oh.  Huh? 
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	  They're beautiful. 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	  Patrick! 
Burger Beard:	 
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	  SpongeBob!
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	  Patrick?
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	 Talk to me, buddy.
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 I'm... I'm seeing a bright light.
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	  Is this better?
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Much. Thank you. But the discomfort I feel in my eyes is nothing compared to the shame I feel for letting down the Patty. For letting down Bikini Bottom.
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	 Yeah, SpongeBob, you really blew it.
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 No, Patrick,  blew it, as a team.
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	 Nope, this one's on you.
Plankton:	  Where do you think  going?
Burger Beard:	  Why don't you get going, little fella, before you hurt yourself?
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	  Plankton?
Plankton/Plank-ton:	 It's Plank-Ton!  Come on down from there, little fella. You wouldn't wanna get hurt. Huh?  Come out, come out wherever you are. Huh?  YAAAAAHHH! MY EYE!! 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 He's getting away!
Plankton/Plank-ton:	  Ready for a Plank-Ton of bubbles? 
Plankton/Plank-ton:	 The formula, please.
Burger Beard:	 Come on. Team up with me. We'll be rich and powerful! Huh?
Plankton/Plank-ton:	 No, thanks. I'm already part of a teamwork. 
Patrick/Mr. Superawesomeness:	 Can we do hands in the middle again?
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Yes, we can, Patrick. But this time there's one more hand to go in the middle.  Plankton?
Plankton/Plank-ton:	  Hmm.
Mr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot:	 [starts to whimper]
Plankton/Plank-ton:	  Here you go, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot:	 Huh?
Plankton/Plank-ton:	 She's all yours.
Mr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot:	 This doesn't have another insulting note in it, does it?
Plankton/Plank-ton:	 No, that's the old me. The one who turned his back on everything important just to have that formula all to himself. But I realize now that keeping something to myself is... ...selfish.
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Especially when that something is the Krabby Patty. Okay, everybody, let's get back to Bikini Bottom and...  Oh, no! I don't have the page!
Sandy/The Rodent:	 Oh, no!
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	  It must be back on Pelican Island!
Plankton/Plank-ton:	 Don't worry. I thought of everything.  All right, SpongeBob, take us home.
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Thanks. Squidward!
Squidward/Sour Note:	 Oh, yeah. 
SpongeBob/Invincibubble:	 Come on, it's time to go back and open up The Krusty Krab!
Squidward/Sour Note:	 Are you out of your patty-flipping mind? [Grabs SpongeBob by the collar] I'll never leave this place! I mean, look at me. I'm a god!
SpongeBob/Invinibubble:	 No, Squidward, you're a cashier. 
Squidward/Sour Note:	 Wait a minute! What?   Well, it was fun while it lasted. 
SpongeBob:	 Don't be sad, Squidward. I left you a little surprise under your shirt!
Squidward:	  Rock-hard abs!  Aw, SpongeBob, you're okay in my book.
SpongeBob:	 Aw, shucks.
Scooter:	 Excuse us! We'd like 3,000 Krabby Patties Please!
Squidward:	 That sound must mean things are back to normal.
SpongeBob:	  Who wants 3,000 Krabby Patties?  First one's for you, Gary. Extra mayo, just the way you like it.
Gary:	  
SpongeBob:	 A-ha! Caught you red-handed! Gary hates mayo!  Plankton!! Up to your old tricks again already, eh?
Plankton:	 Hey, I'm just putting things back the way they were.
SpongeBob:	 What do you have to say about this, Gary? 
Plankton:	  Oh, shrimp. 
SpongeBob:	 See you later, te-am-mate! 
Seagull:	 Now can we sing it?
Kyle:	 Pwease, Mr. Piwate?
Burger Beard:	 Oh, Kyle... How can I say no to you?  Are you ready, kids?!
Seagulls:	 Aye-aye, Captain.
Burger Beard:	 Uh, what did you say? There's sand in my ears and I can't hear you!
Seagulls:	 Aye-aye, Captain!
Bubbles:	 Stop it. That's enough!  SILENCE!!!!!
Seagull:	 Oh, man. I like that song. What happened?
Bubbles:	 I don't like that song and I put an end to it.
Seagull:	 Well, this music is terrible.
Bubbles:	 I suppose you're entitled to your... Wait! Why am I talking to you?
Bubbles:	 That was pretty good actually.
Patrick:	 Oh, yeah, sorry! 
Pearl:	 This dance is so last year.
Squidward:	 You know what this needs? A little interpretive dance!
