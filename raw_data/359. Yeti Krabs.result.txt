Mr. Krabs:	 Squidward!
Squidward:	  What is your problem?
Mr. Krabs:	 My problem is that you aren't workin'! Which means I lose M-U-N-E-E! Which means you lose your J-O-B!
Squidward:	 Remind me again, is that good news or bad news?
Mr. Krabs:	 Tentacles, I mean it!  You get back to mindin' that register!
Squidward:	 Minding it for  which customer?
Mr. Krabs:	 I see your point. But still, I'm not paying you to dream sweet nothin's! Do something! Pick up a mop, a broom, uh, a window wiper, a spatula, even!
Squidward:	 SpongeBob's got that covered.
SpongeBob:	  Dust specs on the window! Don't worry, boss man, I got it covered!  That's better! Oh, sounds like the dishes are done soaking! 
Mr. Krabs:	 That's a perfect example of what I'm talkin' about! Stayin' busy!
Squidward:	 I was busy, trying to forget about this place 'till you woke me up.
Mr. Krabs:	 Okay, have it your way, Squidward! Since you can't be bothered to take the initiative yourself, it's clear I must assign tasks to you. Hmm... Mr. Squidward, scrub the walls of the Krusty Krab 'till they gleam!
SpongeBob:	 Already done, sir! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, that's very nice, boy, thank you. But, you see, I'm tryin' to give Squidward a task.
SpongeBob:	 Hmm... well, the smoke duct needs sweeping!
Mr. Krabs:	 Excellent idea, Mr. SquarePants! Squidward, I'd like you to sweep-- 
SpongeBob:	 Done and dusted! 
Squidward:	 Nice working conditions, but, no thanks! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, is that so?  Perhaps you'd prefer scraping the gum off the underside of these tables!
Squidward:	 Oh, a restaurant employee handling chewed bubble gum? That's gotta violate a lot of health codes.
SpongeBob:	  Not if you wear gloves, it doesn't.  Mind if I take this to Patrick after work, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 I guess SpongeBob has a handle on all the Krusty Krab duties. Which leaves you with all the extracirculars!  Like shinin' me shoes!
Squidward:	 Sorry, all out of polish.
SpongeBob:	  Well, I'm not!
Mr. Krabs:	 Wash me boat!  Listen, Squidward, I'm gonna get a full day's work out of you one way or another.
Squidward:	 It doesn't matter what you "want" me to do, I won't do it!
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh-ho, yeah? Fine...if you refuse to work, then I can't be held responsible.
SpongeBob:	  Responsible for what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 For...for...  ...a visit from...the Yeti Krab.
SpongeBob:	  The Yeti Krab?
Mr. Krabs:	  Yeah. Everyone's heard of the abominable Yeti Krab...  ...with his long, wide hair, and six-pack abs...  ...and yeller' teeth! And everybody knows that he only comes out of his mountain cave to feed on lazy workers.  He's attracted to the scent, he can smell your lazy, lazy stench from hundreds of miles away!
SpongeBob:	  Oh, wait. What am I worried about? I'm a hard-working, self-motivated sponge.
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes, but that won't make any difference because of your proximity to Squidward's laziness. You  be eaten!
SpongeBob:	  Squidward and I are as close as brothers!
Squidward:	 Ludicrous.
Mr. Krabs:	 You won't think so if that big, hairy fellow wants to eat ya!  Yeah. Now, listen up, boys! Bossman Krabs is steppin' out for a minute.  But I want this tub of laundry done before I come back, or...
SpongeBob:	 Or the Yeti Krab will smell our laziness and eat us!
Mr. Krabs:	 Precisely. See ya, boys! 
Squidward:	 Whatever. 
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, what are you doing?  Oh, no! Your lack of work is taking on an odor!
Squidward:	  You sure it's not  you're smelling?
SpongeBob:	 If the Yeti Krab catches wind of it, he's gonna...  you know,  eat us!
Squidward:	 Oh, come on, SpongeBob. Krabs' Yeti story is a complete and total crock!
SpongeBob:	  Squidward, Mr. Krabs would never make up something like that!
Squidward:	 You can believe in whatever garbage you want to. Just do it away from me. Now, run along and wash Krabs' undies.
SpongeBob:	 You got it, Squidward!  Anything to keep that Yeti Krab at bay. 
Narrator:	 Just then... By sheer coincidence...
Yeti Krab's stomach:	 Let me out of here, you hairy brute! I can find my own food!
SpongeBob:	  Good day, sir. Are you  to order?  Oh, Squidward!
Squidward:	  What? What? What? Wha... huh?
SpongeBob:	 You are not gonna believe this! There's a Yeti Krab at table 7! And he is sniffing out the lazy!
Squidward:	  Of course, he is. Nice costume, Eugene. Couldn't you at least have it dry-cleaned or pressed?  Didn't brush this morning. Did we?
SpongeBob:	 Please don't eat us, Mr. Yeti! We're not lazy!
Squidward:	  Oh, yes I am.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, boy! I'll have to work twice as hard to make up for Squidward's laziness!  A wobbly table! Oh, we can't have that!  Come on. No.  There! Perfect!  Yikes! Time to top off the mustard!  See I'm busy! I'm organizing the spice racks! By color!  Well, I guess while I'm down here, I'll hit the old grease traps again.  I'm not lazy! Don't eat me!  I'm sorry, Mr. Yeti Krab!
Squidward:	  I almost feel sorry for the little nimrod.  What the? Do you mind?
SpongeBob:	  Sorry, Squidward! Just burnishing the ceiling!
Squidward:	  Oh, I hope you're happy, Mr. Krabs! You're driving him insane!  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll eat me if I'm lazy. Whatever.  Not the home and garden section! SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob:	  Huh? Oh, sorry. Just making all the rivets are securely welded.
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, we have no customers today! Ergo, we have nothing to do! No matter what that buffoon wants you to think!
SpongeBob:	 Shh! Squidward, he might hear you! Don't worry, Mr. Yeti Krab! We have plenty to do!  I can replenish the toilet paper!  And redecorate Mr. Krabs' office!  And refold the napkins into origami figures!  Knit straw cozies!  Clean the soap!  Re-clean the grill!  Washing inside the walls!  Sucking up every dust particle in the restaurant! 
Squidward:	 Have you lost it, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob:	 Lost it?  Lost it?  What a silly thing to say! 
Squidward:	  Guess I'm down to the comic section. 
SpongeBob:	 Squidward! You were right! There's no more work to do!  I have done it all!  Which means he is gonna eat us!! 
Squidward:	 That does it!  I have had it with this ridiculous ruse!  Using fear to prey on a feeble mind!  Even SpongeBob doesn't deserve that!  Enjoy spooking the witness, eh Krabs? Well, we'll just see how you like it.  Roar! See? I can dress up as a convincing Yeti Krab too! 
SpongeBob:	  T-T-T-T-T-T-Two Yeti Krabs! 
Squidward:	  Take off that phony suit, Mr. Krabs! You're not fooling anybody! 
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm back, fellas!
Squidward:	  Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm a little busy trying to pull off this stupid mask of yours.
Mr. Krabs:	 Uh, Squidward?
Squidward:	 What? 
Mr. Krabs:	 We're as good as Yeti food! I blame Squidward!
SpongeBob:	  Guys, do you hear that?
Squidward:	 You mean the sound of my own flesh sizzling to a crisp? 
SpongeBob:	 No, I'm talking about the sound of a hungry customer. He doesn't want to eat us for being lazy, he wants to eat us because he's hungry. Fellas, leave this to me.
Mr. Krabs:	 Way to go, boy! He loves it!  And look, he's a paying customer.  Come back and see us anytime, Mr. Yeti Krab!  Hey, what are you two doing standing idol? Squidward, sweep out the crow's nest!
Squidward:	 No.
SpongeBob:	  Done! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Refinish me floors!
Squidward:	 No.
SpongeBob:	 Done!
Mr. Krabs:	 Build me a new safe!
Squidward:	 Nuh-uh.
SpongeBob:	 Consider it done!
