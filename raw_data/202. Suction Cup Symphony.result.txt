Squidward:	 SpongeBob, will you keep it down? I am trying to hone my musical talent here.
SpongeBob:	 You mean that wasn't gastrointestinal distress?
Squidward:	 And you guys!  Do you really think that bill board is more important than my musical genius?
Worker 1:	 Well, sorry, but some of us rather enjoy the Bikini Bottom Symphony Orchestra.
Squidward:	  Bikini Bottom Symphony Orchestra?
Worker 1:	 And we find their public announcements to be quite interesting.
Squidward:	 Original compositions wanted? Me, a famous composer?  Thank you!  That would be nice. 
Worker 1:	 Ew!
Squidward:	 Whoo-hooo! Yeah! Yeah!
SpongeBob:	 You've really made him happy.
Worker 2:	 I know what I've done.
SpongeBob:	  Okay...
Squidward:	 Okay.  Get it together, Squidward. Put your game face on.  Heh, that's better.  Take your time with this one, Squidward, old boy.  Due tomorrow?!  Only one day to write my masterpiece! 
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Squidward, we'll do it together!
Squidward:	  No!  Get out!  Patrick, what're you doing here?
Patrick:	 Uhh... I don't know.  I'm funny. 
SpongeBob:	 Are you sure you don't want any help, Squidward?
Squidward:	 No, thank you.  I am a solitary artist.
Patrick:	 SpongeBob...
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Patrick?
Patrick:	 I think, I broke my bottom.
SpongeBob:	  Broke your bottom, oh, Patrick, you're a card!  Whoa! 
Patrick:	 Yeah!  Ah. Much better.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Patrick, I think you should see a doctor.
Patrick:	 I can't see a doctor. My job doesn't provide me with health insurance.
SpongeBob:	 What job is that?
Patrick:	 Exactly.
Squidward:	 I'm a genius! 
SpongeBob:	 The doctor will see you now, Mr. Star.  Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm.
Squidward:	 Can't you two be quiet for one day? My composition is due tomorrow.
SpongeBob:	 Oh no! No, no, no, no, no! My patient is very sick!
Patrick:	 Hey, I broke my butt.

Conductor:	  Hmm, ohh, very unusual. I think we have a winner, Mr. Tentacles! 
Johnny:	 Good evening, music lovers of Bikini Bottom. Tonight, is the premiere of a new symphony, written by one of our own, Squidward Tentacles. 
Squidward:	 I wrote down everything I heard? 
Pilar:	 Oooo! That's gonna leave a mark! 
Nazz:	 Poor little guy. 
Squidward:	 Patrick, get off of me! 
Audience Member:	 Oh, now that's what I call music!
Shubie:	 That little yellow guy is awesome!
