Narrator:	 It's time for another SpongeBob SquarePants special! But it's not an ordinary special,  because today we go to Encino, California, as it was…  …one hundred million years ago! So prepare yourself for…  SpongeBob SquarePants B.C.!  With your host, Patchy the Pirate! 
Patchy:	 Yee-ha! Hey kids! Now, you're probably wondering, "Hmm, what's Patchy doing in a cave?" good question, you little…  Well, it's because today's SpongeBob takes place in prehistoric times  …back when man struggled for survival  and dinosaurs ruled the Earth.  Isn't that right, Bronty? But I'm riding YOU now!  It's stuck.  Like I was saying, prehistoric times were the greatest.  It was a simpler time  with simpler pleasures!  Your clothes always match!  You can draw on the walls! And nobody yell at ya!  It was much easier to hit a baseball!  Oh yeah, prehistoric times were the best.  Hey kids! Are those pterodactyl wings I hear 'a flappin'? I think I know who that is! Please welcome the Potty-dactyl! 
Potty:	  Sorry I'm late.
Patchy:	 Potty! Why aren't you wearing your costume?  I stayed up all night making it!
Potty:	  You're wasting your time, old man. Prehistoric stuff is lame. Everybody knows the future's where it's at.
Patchy:	 What?!  That's not true! Don't mind him, folks. Why even SpongeBob SquarePants knows that prehistoric stuff is, what the kids say,  cool.
Potty:	  No he doesn't.
Patchy:	  Yes he does.
Potty:	 Nope.
Patchy:	 He most certainly does.
Potty:	 No he doesn't.
Patchy:	 Yes he does!
Potty:	 No.
Patchy:	  I know for a fact that he does!
Potty:	 …not. 
Narrator:	 Meanwhile. 
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob! What's wrong?
SpongeBob:	 I don't know, Mr. Krabs, but I've got this strangest feeling that somewhere a pirate and parrot are arguing about me.  And the parrot is winning. 
Patchy:	 Does.
Potty:	 Doesn't.
Patchy:	 Does.
Potty:	 Doesn't.
Patchy:	 Does.
Potty:	 Doesn't.
Patchy:	 Does! Uh, look, while we're arguing, why don't you folks go ahead and watch some prehistoric SpongeBob! Roll the cartoon! …does.
Potty:	 Doesn't. 
Narrator:	 Ah, dawn breaks over the primordial sea.  It's here that millions of years ago, life began taking its first clumsy steps out of the darkness, opening its newly- formed eyeballs to stare into the blinding light of intelligence, in order to- Umm... never mind. This happened a long time ago.
SpongeGar:	 Banooga ready! Tabonga, Gary.
Prehistoric Gary:	 Meow.

Patar:	 
Narrator:	 Hooray! It looks like our prehistoric pals have just discovered fire, but they will soon learn that when you play with fire, you may get burned. Stay tuned. 
Patchy:	 I told you prehistoric times were fun! Hey! How's about I teach you kids how a caveman makes a fire with  two sticks?  Yeah… Doesn't get any cooler than that, huh? Chalk one up for Patchy!  Rubbing…  I guess this is a type of wood that doesn't burn.  Potty! 
Potty:	  Laser technology. Score one for the future. 
Patchy:	 Well, I have something that you'll never find in your little  future: a real live caveman. Hmm…  Hey, there he is! Come on in, little troglodyte fella. Come on…  You see kids, I found him frozen in a block of ice and then I spent three days thawing him out with my mom's hair dryer. I call him Cavey.  Isn't he something? It's OK, Cavey. 
Potty:	 That's nothing, old timer. Make way for the future. 
Robot:	 Greetings. I am the X-29488. How may I serve you? 
Patchy:	 Where do you keep getting all this stuff?
Potty:	 Never you mind, pops. Let's go see what Cavey thinks. 
Robot:	 Attack!!!!!! Attack!!!!! 
Patchy:	 Potty!! You're ruining me caveman show!
Robot:	 Attack!!!!! Attack!!!!!!!! 
Narrator:	 Will Patchy ever get control of the special?  What will SpongeBob do with fire?  Stay tuned to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. and find out! 
Narrator:	 Welcome back to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. Sounds like things have gone from bad to worse for Patchy. Let's watch! 
Potty:	  This is great.
Patchy:	 Ahoy, glad you're back.  Let's watch the rest of SpongeBob B.C. while I get things straightened out around here. Whoa!  Or… maybe not. 
Narrator:	 When we last saw our hungry troglodytes, they just discovered fire. How long will it take for them to mess it up? Let's see. 
Squog:	 Bolapa. 
Squog:	 Ganoga, Patar. Ganoga, SpongeGar.
Patar:	 Ganoga, Squog. Ganoga, SpongeGar.

Narrator:	 Perhaps certain events in history are better left untold. 
Patchy:	 Now I know how Squidward feels… 
Potty:	  Why the long face?
Patchy:	 I think you know perfectly well, you little winged vermin. All I wanted was to show the nice people how great the cavemen were. But all they got was technology-induced chaos!
Potty:	 Come back inside. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Patchy:	 You got rid of the robot android cyborg?!
Potty:	 Nope, even better. 
Patchy:	  Potty, I guess I really misjudged you…  What the-?!! 
Song:	 "When Worlds Collide"
Potty:	 Pretty sweet, eh?
Squidward:	  Future!
Potty:	 Word!
SpongeTron:	  I am SpongeTron.
Patchy:	 Well Potty, I guess you were right. The future is cool.
Potty:	 Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I got you a present from the prehistoric times.
Patchy:	 Ooh! What is it? A new loincloth?
Potty:	 No.
Patchy:	 An enlarged forehead?
Potty:	 No. 
Patchy:	 Aww, what is it?  Potty!!! 
Potty:	  This is great. 
Patchy:	 Well, thanks for watching SpongeBob B.C. kids.  Bye!  Now he's tickling!  Cut it out, you rascal!
