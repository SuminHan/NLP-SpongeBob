SpongeBob:	 Ah, time for bed, Gary. 
Gary:	 Meow?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Gary.  You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary.  Hey! Over here!  Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license!  Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it!  I sure take a good picture.  Darn! I should have grown a mustache.  How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt.  Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here.  Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
Mrs. Puff:	  Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!
SpongeBob:	 No!  Ouch! Where am I?  Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
Gary:	 Meow.  Meow.
SpongeBob:	  This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look.  Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is.  Gary! Huh?  Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? 
Gary:	  SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Gary?
Gary:	 How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?
SpongeBob:	 Gary! You can talk!
Gary:	  In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
SpongeBob:	 What does that mean?
Gary:	 Come.  For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm.  "Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again." Emily Dickinson wrote that.
SpongeBob:	 Who?
Gary:	  Here's one you might know.  There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
SpongeBob:	  Gee Gary, you sure are smart.
Gary:	 Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
SpongeBob:	 Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. 
Gary:	 Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
SpongeBob:	  I wonder what Patrick's dreaming.  I can't resist!  Hey Patrick!
Patrick:	 Hi SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	  You know Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
Patrick:	 Yup.
SpongeBob:	 I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper.  Going up! Eh?  I can make...  A million of me! Eh? Eh?
Patrick:	 Yup. 
SpongeBob:	 Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. 
Patrick:	 Okay. Bye SpongeBob.  Oh!  Shoot, that was my last quarter. 
SpongeBob:	 Ooh, this is gonna be good!  Psst! Squidward!  Hey, Squidward!
Squidward:	 SpongeBob!
King:	 Ahem!  Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
Squidward:	 Yes, Your Highness.  SpongeBob!
King:	 Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play!  Oh do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
Squidward:	  Sponge-  Bob...
King:	  I came here here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
Squidward:	 
SpongeBob:	  Squidward!  Huh? Huh?
Squidward:	  No way.
King:	 Ahem! 
Squidward:	  Please SpongeBob, no tricks.
SpongeBob:	 Trust me, Squidward. 
SpongeBob:	  La la! La la la la la la la! 
Squidward:	  SpongeBob!
King:	  Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
SpongeBob:	 
Fish:	  His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
Squidward:	  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! 
Fish:	 What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
SpongeBob:	  So long, Squidward! 
Squidward:	 
SpongeBob:	  Hey! I'm at Sandy's!  Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... 
Sandy:	  Hey SpongeBob, what brings you here?
SpongeBob:	 Hey Sandy! What's going on?
Sandy:	  Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. 
SpongeBob:	 This seems kind of dangerous!
Sandy:	 Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
SpongeBob:	 Okay! 
Sandy:	 Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! 
SpongeBob:	 Gotcha! 
Sandy:	 Not a Parakeet! Para-  medic...
SpongeBob:	  Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams.  H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs.  Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
Pearl:	 Hello, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob:	  Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
Pearl:	 You're just in time for the tea party!
SpongeBob:	 Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
Pearl:	  Oh. He's next door.  Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
SpongeBob:	 Bye!  I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. 
Krabs:	 I've got you now, you slippery demon!  You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. 
SpongeBob:	 Whatcha doin Mr. Krabs?
Krabs:	 I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
SpongeBob:	 What are you talking about?
Krabs:	 I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash.  It's the mighty Moby Dollar!  Did you see her boy? I got her! Here she comes!  There she blows!
SpongeBob:	  Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
Krabs:	 Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
SpongeBob:	  This one?
Krabs:	 No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
SpongeBob:	  Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
Krabs:	 Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
SpongeBob:	  Net ready, sir!
Krabs:	  I did it!  I finally did it!
SpongeBob:	 Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.  
Krabs:	 No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
SpongeBob:	 Huh?
Krabs:	 Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey! Hey! I...!
Krabs:	 No! 
SpongeBob:	 This'll make a great fish story, eh Mr. Krabs?
Krabs:	  Oh SpongeBob...
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs:	  You're fired! 
SpongeBob:	  Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
Plankton:	 Zap!  I see you.  Zap! 
Fred:	 My leg!
Plankton:	 I see you. Zap!
SpongeBob:	 Plankton! 
Plankton:	 I see you...  Zap!  Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty.  Crush!  Lick, lick!
SpongeBob:	 This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
Gary:	 Meow! Meow!
SpongeBob:	  Gary! Gary! No!
Gary:	 Meow! 
Plankton:	 Here kitty, kitty, kitty.
SpongeBob:	 Gary!  I've got you, Gary!
Plankton:	 Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot!  Yeah! Huh?  Yow!
SpongeBob:	  I think he's got the point. 
Plankton:	  Waaaaaah!  Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh?  No! No! No! Not the face! 
SpongeBob:	  Ooh!  Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud.  Ah... 
Squidward:	  SpongeBob! 
Sandy:	 SpongeBob!
Krabs:	 SpongeBob!
Patrick:	 SpongeBob!
Plankton:	 SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	  What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no! 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	  Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
Squidward:	 No. We are not having a slumber party!
Sandy:	 Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!
All except SpongeBob:	 
Plankton:	 Take a hike!
Squidward:	 Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Gary:	  Meow!
Patrick:	  Does anyone have a quarter?
