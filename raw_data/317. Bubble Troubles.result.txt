Patrick:	 After you.
SpongeBob:	 Ah, thank you Patrick. 
Patrick:	 My turn. 
SpongeBob:	 Neato.  Watch this. 
Patrick:	  Wow.  Medesonium prodamy! 
SpongeBob:	 You know, Patrick,  we should spice up our bubble blowing.
Patrick:	 Yeah, yeah. Spice.  No spice. Hmm...  Hot sauce!  Spicy bubbles. ]
SpongeBob:	 Hmm... 
Patrick:	 I wonder if hot sauce is bad for our eyes.
Both:	 Nah. 
Squidward:	   20 years of paint-staking care, and my bonsai portrait is almost complete. Oh! Oh, my. What's this?  I missed a spot. Not to worry. You'll be perfect soon, as perfect as me. Hmm...   Oh. Look what I've done.  Oh, no!
Bonsai Squidward:	  Squidward.
Squidward:	 What? What? Who said that?
Bonsai Squidward:	 It's me, your bonsai Squidward. Will you grant me my final request?
Squidward:	 Of..of course.  What...what...what is it?
Bonsai Squidward:	 Avenge me.
Squidward:	 "Avenge me?"  SpongeBob!
Patrick:	 I must have more.
SpongeBob:	 You want more? 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob you moron, you ruined my bonâ€¦  ...sai. 
SpongeBob:	 Let's go to Sandy's.
SpongeBob:	 Sandy, Sandy, check out these new spicy bubbles that Patrick invented.
Patrick:	 Yeah, I thinked it up with my own head. Now I'm as smart as Sandy
SpongeBob:	 Maybe even smarter.
Sandy:	 Smarter, huh? Well, I'd love to try out your new-fangled bubbles, Patrick, but I've got to fix these air lines to my treedome. They're all clogged up and the lack of fresh air is making me woozy.
Patrick:	 Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person?  Guess you're just too dumb.
SpongeBob:	 I know Sandy. I'll use these spicy bubbles. They'll clean out your pipes for you. 
Sandy:	 That's sweet of you, SpongeBob, but a bunch of little old bubbles ain't gonna clear these air lines. 
Sandy:	 
SpongeBob:	 Oops.
Sandy:	 I'll tar and feather you nincompoops later. My suit's air supply is nearing empty. Luckily, I have just enough air in my submarine to get to the surface and refill my air tanks.
SpongeBob:	 Phew! Thank goodness. Allow me to get the door. 
Patrick:	 Even I knew that was dumb.
Sandy:	 Oh, no! I have only a few minutes of air left! I'm far too dizzy already. You'll have to drive, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Whoo!  How's Sandy doing back there?
Patrick:	 I'm not sure. Let me check.  Oh!
Sandy:	 Hey there, Patty-Pat-Pat-Pat-Patrick. Careful where you're breathing. You don't want to disturb the subatomic particle rodeo. Yee-haw, micro-dawgies! Rope them molecules.
Patrick:	 She's totally losing it.
Sandy:	  Are there cobwebs on my face? 'Cause it feels like there's cobwebs on my face.
Patrick:	 Never mind. She seems fine.
SpongeBob:	 Hold on just a little longer, Sandy, we're almost there. I can see sunlight..  ...horrible dehydrating sunlight. 
Sandy:	 Gimme that wheel, SquareButt. I know a shortcut. 
SpongeBob:	 Make sure and hold her tight, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Don't worry. She's not going anywhere.
Sandy:	 Ahh...  You taste like glass. 
SpongeBob:	  Blah! Fresh air. Let's hurry up and get this over with.
Patrick:	 Get what over with?
SpongeBob:	 Where's Sandy
Patrick:	 I thought she was with you.
SpongeBob:	 Uh-oh. 
Sandy:	 Hang on, fellers! I got a hankering for a Krabby Patty 
SpongeBob:	 Sandy, what are you doing? The air is up there.
Sandy:	 Yeah, yeah. Right after I grab a quick bit at the Krusty Krab. Yee-haw.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 No! 
Sandy:	 Oh, well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore. 
SpongeBob:	 No Sandy, you need air, not food! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey! What's going on out here?
SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs, Sandy's run out of that crazy air stuff that she needs to breathe. We have to find some right now or she'll be headed for the last roundup.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, okay. I suppose I can't have her croaking at the Krusty Krab. That'd be bad for business. All right, let's see here. Hmm... Oxygen. "02," I believe. Good old atomic number eight.
Sandy:	 
Patrick:	 Uh--uh--  Hey, everyone. Look! There's some air bubbles trapped on the ceiling.
Mr. Krabs:	 But how are you gonna get them down? 
SpongeBob:	 Never fear. I know what to do. We can use these straws to suck the bubbles down.
Mr. Krabs:	 Wait a minute. Those straws cost me money!
SpongeBob:	  Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll put them all back. 
Patrick:	 Hurry up, SpongeBob. I'm no doctor, but I don't think squirrels are suppose to be blue. 
SpongeBob:	 Okay, I'm ready. 
Patrick:	 Just a little bit further. Okay, got it. 
SpongeBob:	 Hurry up, Patrick. 
Sandy:	 Hm-mmm. 
Patrick:	 Looks like her color's coming back. 
SpongeBob:	 That's good, but is it gonna be good enough? Mr. Krabs, you must have some spare Squidward always says you're full of hot air. 
Squidward:	 I said what? 
Mr. Krabs:	 So you think I'm full of hot air, do ye? Well, in this case, you're right. There's usually an air bubble or two trapped inside me shell.  Go ahead. Don't be shy. 
Pearl:	 Daddy, there's a submarine on the roof. Oh, you seem kind of busy. Maybe I should come back later. 
SpongeBob:	  No, Pearl. Don't go. You're a mammal, right? 
Pearl:	 Yeah, I guess so. 
SpongeBob:	 And you breathe air, right? 
Pearl:	 Sure, my nose is full of it.
SpongeBob:	 You've got t.o help Sandy. She needs to share your air.
Sandy:	 
Pearl:	 I guess us mammals have to stick together.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, hold still. This may pinch a little  Okay, Pearl let 'er rip.  Now just keep breathing, Pearl. Come with me, Patrick. I have an idea that'll fix everything.  I'm gonna go up to the surface to get some air.  When I tug on this rope, you pull me down.
Patrick:	 But how are you going to get up there?
SpongeBob:	 I'll use this tank of oxygen as a makeshift rocket.
Patrick:	 An oxygen tank! Great idea, buddy.
SpongeBob:	 I know. Wish me luck, old friend. 
Patrick:	  SquarePants, I salute you.
SpongeBob:	  Okay, SpongeBob, it's time to catch a breath for Sandy.  So fresh it hurts.  Okay, Patrick, pull me down. 
Patrick:	 Hey, who did that? Hey! Oh! Ghosts! 
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, here we go. 
Patrick:	 Ah, ah! Oof! 
SpongeBob:	  Welcome back, Sandy. 
Sandy:	 I'm alive? And the treedome's full of air? And sort of dry? How'd you fellers pull it off?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, you could say we had a little help from a big bubble. 
Sandy:	 Hmm... In case you forgot, it was bubbles that got into this mess in the first place. I don't want you blowing any more bubbles around my house.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Uh-oh.
