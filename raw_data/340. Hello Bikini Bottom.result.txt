Squidward:	 Ah-he-he-hem. 
SpongeBob:	 Kind of sounds like Squidward's practicing his clarinet over there. Doesn't it, Gary? Gary? Well, I can't just stand by and let him practice alone. Then what kind of a friend and neighbor would I be? Not that kind that I... ...would want.

Mr. Krabs:	 Roadie! Check!
Mr. Krabs:	 Here we are boys! Our first gig! All those people are lined up to see you!
Squidward:	 Sounds like a load of hooey...
Mr. Krabs:	 Alright roadie, start unloading the hooey! 
Patrick:	  Uh, Mr. Krabs? Where do I put this?
Mr. Krabs:	  Anywhere is fine.
Patrick:	 Then what about this? 
SpongeBob:	 Hey! Look! It's Ned and the Needlefish!
Colonel Carper:	 Well, well, well! If it isn't that guy that stole my band! I hope you all aren't here to steal THIS band, too! Because THIS time around, I'll be ready for ya!

Colonel Carper:

Colonel Carper:	 You are! And the fact that YOU think you have any idea what it takes to put on a musical tour!
Mr. Krabs:	 We have a tour bus, sound equipment, a roadie!
Colonel Carper:	 You call THAT a tour bus?  You call THIS sound equipment? That's not a roadie, THESE are roadies! 
Mr. Krabs:	 AHHHHHHH!!!!
Colonel Carper:	 I'll tell you what, I'll let you open for Ned and the Needlefish on one condition: My roadies get to sabotage your sound equipment and have it blow up during your soundtrack!
Mr. Krabs:	 Wait a minute...what's that gonna cost me?
Colonel Carper:	 Oh, that will be free!
Mr. Krabs:	  Deal!
Mr. Krabs:	 Ok Mr. Squidward. Take it from the top!  Doggonit...
Colonel Carper:	 Hah hah hah! Now you don't have ANY sound equipment! Unlike me who has this ENTIRE wall of speakers you see right behind me! HAH HAH HAH!!! Now your whole tour is RUINED!!! Hah hah hah hah!  Seriously! I can't! I can't take it!It's too much! 
SpongeBob:	 It sure was nice of that Colonel Carper guy to let us borrow his entire wall of sound equipment! Wasn't it Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, here we are! Our next gig! 
Squidward:	 We're performing at a supermarket!? Driver, turn this bus around! The tour is canceled! Head straight back to the Krusty Krab!
Mr. Krabs:	 Sorry Squidward but that is physically impossible!
Squidward:	 What!?
Mr. Krabs:	 Because it's not there anymore!
SpongeBob:	 The Krusty Krab's not there anymore!? Where'd it go?
Mr. Krabs:	 I pawned it! To raise the cash for the concert tour!
SpongeBob:	  YOU DID WHAT!?!?
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah...hard to believe, I know! My heard aches when I think of me old girl cold and lonely. Just sitting in the front window of that dirty pawn shop at the mercy of any random joe who just happens to pass on by.
Plankton:	  Gasp!  Hopping Hamburger Stands! I gotta go home and get my wallet!
Squidward:	 It's not even my restaurant and somehow I regret that decision...
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey! Now quit your worrying back there! With the success we're about to have, we'll be able to buy ten Krusty Krabs!
Squidward:	 A one! And a two! And a one, two, three, four!  Thank you! Thank you very much!  Oh come on! Nothing!?
Mr. Krabs:	 What a happy celebration!
Dwight T. Wad:	 I most certainly agree!
Mr. Krabs:	 Thank you Mr......Supermarker Manager.
Dwight T. Wad:	 Here you go! 
Mr. Krabs:	 What's this? Our pay check?
Dwight T. Wad:	 Nope! It's a bill! 
Mr. Krabs:	 WHAT!?
Squidward:	 You're kidding me, right!? We're performing at a retirement home!?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh don't worry Squidward! These geezers really know how to party!
Squidward:	  Oh yeah...they got one foot in the rave. Heh heh...reaper jerks!
Squidward:	 Two, three, four!  Two, three, four!

Squidward:	 Supermarket openings, retirement homes! What's next a child's birthday party!  This is our WORSE gig yet: Children parties! Well if this is the way this tour is being organized, then I would like to...OOOOOOOOW!!!!  I AM NOT DONKEY-FISH!!!
Squidward:	  Mr. Krabs, how much farther is it to the next town?
Mr. Krabs:	  Uh...not too much farther Squidward! Uh...oh in fact, we're just entering it now! 
Squidward:	 Well if this concert is anywhere near terrible as the other ones, then it's gonna be my last!  What the...Electronics Outhouse!? Good bye! 
Mr. Krabs:	 This ain't our next concert!
Squidward:	 Well then, where is it!?
Mr. Krabs:	 It's uh...uh...um... Well it's right over there obviously!  I'll just leave the three of you right here to set up! I some important tour management business to attend to if you know!
Squidward:	 Hold it! This better not be one of your tricks Mr. Krabs!
Band Member 1:	 Hey look, man!  "Ned and the Needlefish, Next Turn."
Ned:	 Woah...it's like a sign from....sign man... Wow...we have really moved down in the world...
SpongeBob:	 Isn't this the most exciting experience in your entire life Squidward?
Squidward:	 Yeah...I've never thought I get to perform for so many fans!
SpongeBob:	 Oh? Are there people showing up?
Squidward:	 Isn't that...what you were talking about?  Ah...just soak on in Squidy old boy! Pretty invigorating isn't it? Wait a minute...why are they chanting "Ned and the Needlefish?"
SpongeBob:	 No, can't you hear them Squidward? They're saying Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward and SpongeBob! Squidward...
Harold:	 That does not look like Ned and the Needlefish! 
Squidward:	 Wait! I know what you came here for!  Well?
Harold:	 CHASE 'EM OFF STAGE!!!

Mr. Krabs:	 Wait a minute! Where'd you think you're going with your own equipment!?
Patrick:	 Hey thanks again fellas! Nice guys like them don't come around much these days. They even redecorated the tour busmobile for us! 
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	' ' How'd the show go boy?
SpongeBob:	 Oh the crowd went wild sir!
Squidward:	 In fact, they're still going wild...

Squidward:	 Well, that wasn't a complete waste of time...Oh no wait, it was...
Mr. Krabs:	  Now I'll never get me ol' Krusty Krab out of hog! 
SpongeBob:	 MR. KRABS!!!
Mr. Krabs:	 Good news boys! We only sustained a flat tire! Patrick, go get the spare lad!
Patrick:	 Uh...oh! Yeah, I can't.
Squidward:	 What do you mean you can't?
Patrick:	 Well...
Squidward:	 No no! Wait! Let me guess: You ate the spare tire?
Patrick:	 Wow...you're good at guessing...
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, why didn't you just ask me?  You know I always bring tiny, snack size tires for in-between meals! You know, I'm kinda hungry now actually.  Hmm...Squidward? They're fat free!
Squidward:	 Mr. Krabs, I'd like some money for cab fair.
Mr. Krabs:	 But Mr. Squidward!
Squidward:	 But nothing. I'm going home. Now put some cash in my hands so I...
Mr. Krabs:	 WAHHH!!!!!  But I don't have any money lad! Not even a nickel! It's all gone! Me Krusty Krab is gone!!!
Squidward:	  Forget it! I'll just walk! 
SpongeBob:	 Wait! Squidward! Squidward! You can't go! Please! Don't you see? The Krusty Krab needs us more than ever!

SpongeBob:	 Squidward! Are you okay?
Squidward:	 Get your hands off me!  OWWWW!!!! 
SpongeBob:	 Squidward?
Squidward:	 Don't...
SpongeBob:	 ♪Squidward...you must look inward. And then I'm sure that you will see what an awesome band we still could be! Please! Oh please don't quit on us now!

Squidward:	 ♪How did I not see this plan was a failure from the start? Being around SpongeBob is bad for my heart! And that's not even the worse part! Supermarkets, retirement homes, birthday parties for kids! My career in music really feels like it has hit the skids! I give up! There is no point! I give up! Mr. Krabs will have to go bankrupt while I'm busy, bittering giving up!♪
SpongeBob:	 ♪Don't you see? Mr. Krabs needs us terribly! We got it in us to be a huge success! You and I can't settle for less! I promise myself not to shed this tear!♪
Squidward:	 ♪It's getting really cold out here and I'm four hundred miles from home it will appear! And my feet are hurting oh dear I fear this tentacle-itis is pretty severe!♪
Squidward's Foot:	 ♪WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH!!!♪

SpongeBob:	 ♪This is the part where I stand up and play!♪
SpongeBob and Squidward:	 ♪Take a deep breath in an emotional way! 'Cause with my instrument is how I SAAAAYYYYY!!!! 
Squidward:	 Wow! That was actually, kinda good! 
Harold:	 Amazing!
Male Fish:	 Fantastic!
Mr. Krabs:	 Unbelievable! They actually gathered a crowd! To think that all of these people came out to the middle of the desert to see Squidward and SpongeBob!
Patrick:	 Or...they came to see the meteor shower that passes through the Aurora Borealis generating a stunning, once-in-a-lifetime light show.
Crowd:	  Oh....ah....
Mr. Krabs:	  Thank you! Come again please!  He he he!
SpongeBob:	 Look! It's Mr. Krabs! Squidward and I just performed for an crowd of adoring fans!
Mr. Krabs:	 That's nice! I just made more money than I know what to do with!
Squidward:	 Well it looks like they could help you figure it out...
Mr. Krabs:	 Who?  Get Paid Back from Mr. Krabs Line starts here...
Narrator:	 One long angry line later...
Colonel Carper:	 Well well well! It looks like this is the end of the line for you! Both literally and figuratively! Hah! Hah! Hah!
Mr. Krabs:	 Why'd I owe you money for!?
Colonel Carper:	 Well let's see: How about damaged sound equipment, loss revenue, and JUST BECAUSE!
Mr. Krabs:	 I don't owe you a nickel!
Colonel Carper:	 No! You owe me a MILLION nickels! Roadies! It's collecting time!
Mr. Krabs:	 Collecting time!? 
Colonel Carper:	 HAH HAH HAH HAH!!! YEAH!! AH HA! Okay boys! Our work here is done!

Mr. Krabs:	  Well, SpongeBob! You ready to get back to doing what we do best?
