Narrator:	 Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends. 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
SpongeBob:	 Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine. 
Mr. Krabs:	 They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes.  The hooks! The hooks!
Fred:	 How about a mint?
Mr. Krabs:	 The hooks! The hooks!
Tom:	 Can you make that to go?
Squidward:	  You don't know how lucky you are.
Mr. Krabs:	 The hooks. So there I was minding my own business...
Squidward:	 I'd love to hear one of your riveting sea tales, but I have to do my waste basket inspection.  Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one.
Mr. Krabs:	 Fine, but don't say I didn't warn ya.
SpongeBob:	 Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 The hooks, me bucko. They're back. Beware the hooks.
SpongeBob:	 The hooks?
Mr. Krabs:	 Aye.  The hooks. They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey they grab you by the britches...  ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher   until you're hauled up to the surface flopping and gasping for breath. And then they cook ya, and then they eat ya, or worse...
SpongeBob:	  What could be worse than that?
Mr. Krabs:	 Gift shops. 
SpongeBob:	  Don't let em get me, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen. Time is money.
SpongeBob:	 Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. 
Patrick:	  Good morning, Krusty Krew.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Guess what? The carnivals in town. Come on, let's go.
SpongeBob:	 I can't leave now. I'm working.
Patrick:	 It's not leaving. It's just taking a break.  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni...  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town.  I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
SpongeBob:	 Where is everybody?
Patrick:	 I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier.
SpongeBob:	 Doesn't look like any carnival I ever...  Excuse me.  Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs said they were really dangerous.
Patrick:	  Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!
SpongeBob:	 All I know is that Mr. Krabs said...Patrick, don't do that!
Patrick:	 Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it.
SpongeBob:	 But, Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, let me ask you something.  Does this look dangerous?
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, don't!
Patrick:	 Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel... 
SpongeBob:	  Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend.  Patrick, you're alive.
Patrick:	 Am I ever. You should try it.
SpongeBob:	 But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops.
Patrick:	 You just jump off before you get too high.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
Patrick:	 Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? 
SpongeBob:	 Well, no.
Patrick:	 Wheeee.
SpongeBob:	 I guess he didn't. 
Patrick:	 Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away! 
SpongeBob:	 Ready?
Patrick:	 Ready.
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 Geronimo! 
SpongeBob:	 This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab. 
Ivy:	 P.U.,  you call this food?!
Harold:	 My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!
Another Harold:	  My sandwich IS a fried boot!
Fred:	 Hurry it up, will ya? Were hungry over here. Look at us. My kids haven't eaten in three days and I'm dying. That's not how you're supposed to flip it. 
Squidward:	 Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!
Mr. Krabs:	 Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
Squidward:	 It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break.  What?
Mr. Krabs:	 I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taking a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59.  Now, what were you saying?
Squidward:	 He took a break.
Mr. Krabs:	  Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues.  Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget.
Squidward:	 But Mr. Krabs, I still need help! 
Mr. Krabs:	  They should be right here. 
Patrick:	 Again?
SpongeBob:	 Again!
Mr. Krabs:	 The hooks! No! No! No!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	  1, 2, 3...
Mr. KrabsÂ :	 Wait! Wait!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 ...blastoff. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! [] If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd...  ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
SpongeBob:	 I...I...I...
Patrick:	 I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down.
Mr. Krabs:	 And do you know what happens when you  float back down?
SpongeBob:	 Gift shop?
Mr. Krabs:	 Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna.  With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise. 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
SpongeBob & Patrick:	  We promise Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 I need a sailors promise. Repeat after me: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks we'll never go.
Mr. Krabs:	 Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Ahh! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck.
Mr. Krabs:	 Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. 
SpongeBob:	 Ok, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 I'm ready!  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready. 
Patrick:	 Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way. 
SpongeBob:	 I always go to work this way.
Patrick:	 You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!
SpongeBob:	 But, Patrick, we promised.
Patrick:	 Well, I had my fingers crossed.
SpongeBob:	 You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.
SpongeBob:	 But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick:	 Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
SpongeBob:	 Umm...
Patrick:	 See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm going to go have some fun.  Come on SpongeBob. You know you want to.
SpongeBob:	 Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs that I wouldn't go near another...  ...hook!  Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar. A deceiver. I'll never fall for your tricks again. Never!  Is this seat taken?  Whew. Glad I got that out of my system.  I'm...hooked! And that means...  Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
Mr. Krabs:	 Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
Pearl:	 Thanks, dad.
Mr. Krabs:	 Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob:	 Psst, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
SpongeBob:	 Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
Mr. Krabs:	 Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
SpongeBob:	 Umm...no.  I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you lade?
SpongeBob:	 Of course not.  I mean, not exactly.  I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it!  Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
SpongeBob:	 What am I going to do?
Mr. Krabs:	 There's only one thing to do, boy. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls.  Doh, ok. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off.  There.
Mr. Krabs:	 Uhh...lad?
SpongeBob:	  Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!
Mr. Krabs:	 I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob.  But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob:	  Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise.  Please save me, Mr. Krabs!  I promise I'll be good!  Whew. 
Pearl:	 Ooh, look!  It's SpongeBob NudeyPants. 
Squidward:	  Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
Mr. Krabs:	 Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
Squidward:	 Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. 
Patrick:	  Hello? Does somebody have a can opener?
