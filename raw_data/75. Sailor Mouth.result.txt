Mr. Krabs:	 Well, it's the worst time of the day once again.  Closing time!
SpongeBob:	 Well, see you in the A.M., Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hold on there, SpongeBob!  Take that pile of filth out with you. 
SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs, you shouldn't talk about Squidward like that!
Squidward:	 He means this filth, you loon. 
SpongeBob:	  Takin' out the trash, takin' out the trash.
SpongeBob:	 Hmm...dumpster writing! The voice of the people! "Up with bubbles, down with air!"  "Nematodes are people too!"  Ha, those Nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells.  Good.  Hmm, what's this one? Krabs is a... hmm? Krabs is a .
Garbage Man:	  Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
SpongeBob:	 Well, sometimes, but not... Recently.
Patrick:	 Hi, garbage man. Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Hi, Patrick! Hey, Patrick, do you know what this word means?
Patrick:	 "Krabs..." Uh, isn't that the red sweaty guy you work for?
SpongeBob:	  Nah-uh, not that word, that word.
Patrick:	 Hmm... ! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers.
SpongeBob:	 Sentence enhancers?
Patrick:	 You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-o! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I get it! Let me try.  Hello, Patrick. Lovely  day we're having, isn't it?
Patrick:	 Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This  day is particularly  lovely!
SpongeBob:	 How  right you are, Patrick!
SpongeBob:	 Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation.
Patrick:	 Oh, mine too!
SpongeBob:	 It tingles when I laugh!
SpongeBob:	 Hello, customers, nice  day we're having, uh? 
Harold:	  Did he just say?!
Pirate Fish:	 Aye, he did.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Patrick, how the  are ya?
Patrick:	  Pretty  good, SpongeBob.
Old Man Jenkins:	 I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention.
SpongeBob:	  Attention, customers, today's special is a  Krabby Patty served in a greasy  sauce and grilled to  perfection.  And don't forget to ask us to  the  fries. It will be our  pleasure.  Hi Squidward, how the  are ya?
Patrick:	 Nice  day we're having, isn't it Squidward?
Tom:	 I don't understand. That guy's talented, he doesn't have to work blue.
Evelyn:	 Let's go somewhere more family oriented. 
Female Fish:	  I'm never eating here again.
Male Fish:	  Those foul-mouth bottom feeders.
Mr. Krabs:	  Huh? Ah! The Krusty Krab, she's empty!  All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?
Squidward:	 Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, what was it? What'd he say?
Squidward:	 Er...he said...um, well he said...
Mr. Krabs:	 Huh?  SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!
SpongeBob:	 But Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers.
Patrick:	 Yeah, it's fancy talk.
Mr. Krabs:	 There ain't nothing fancy about that word!
SpongeBob:	 You mean ?
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes, that one! Now quit saying that! It's a bad word!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Bad word?! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.
Squidward:	 Don't you mean there are only 7?
Mr. Krabs:	 Not if you're a sailor! 
SpongeBob:	 Wow, 13!
Patrick:	 That's a lot of  bad words!
Mr. Krabs:	 OK, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 We promise.
SpongeBob:	 Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!
Patrick:	 Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.
SpongeBob:	 Yea, verily! Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators.
Patrick:	 Oh, boy, my favorite! 
SpongeBob:	 Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes! 
Patrick:	 Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel.
SpongeBob:	 Darn. 
Patrick:	 My turn!  Hooray! Escalators! Yay!  Up, up, up!
SpongeBob:	 Come on, escalators, escalators, escalators!   Eels again.
Patrick:	 My turn!  Escalators!
SpongeBob:	 Escalators, Escalators, Escalators!  Eels?
Patrick:	  Es-skee-lators!!  Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!
SpongeBob:	  Escalators, escalators, escalators!!  Ha! Escalators! 
Patrick:	 Eels...
SpongeBob:	 Ah, ! 
Patrick:	 Ooooh...! You said number 11!
SpongeBob:	  I didn't mean... you gotta understand, Patrick, I was trying...what I meant to say was...some things just slip out. You gotta understand!
Patrick:	 Don't worry SpongeBob, I understand.  Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! 
SpongeBob:	  No wait, Patrick!  Patrick, no, please don't tell!
Patrick:	 But, you said ""! 
SpongeBob:	 Aha! Now I'm gonna tell Mr. Krabs on you!
Patrick:	 Not if I tell first!
SpongeBob:	 I can run faster than you! 
Patrick:	  See ya at the Krusty Krab! Ha, ha, ha!  Oh no!
SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 What, what, what?
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, Patrick, Patrick!
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes, yes, yes?
SpongeBob:	 He said, he said, he said!
Mr. Krabs:	 Out with it, boy!
SpongeBob:	  Me and Patrick were playing Eels and Escalators, and Patrick was going up-up-up, and I had to ride the eel and then we ran and Patrick, he said some things.
Mr.Krabs:	  What kind of things?
SpongeBob:	 Well, he said...
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes?!
SpongeBob:	 Well, uh, let's just say he said a certain word that you said we shouldn't say, and this particular word happens to be number 11 in the 13 words you said shouldn't be said.
Mr. Krabs:	 Uh... Right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?
Patrick:	  Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs! 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 He said that word that you said we shouldn't say...!
SpongeBob:	 ...number thirteen...
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Mmm-mmm...!
Mr. Krabs:	 Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Mmm-hmm...  He said ""!
Mr. Krabs:	  Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash.  You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back. 
Patrick:	 What's going to happen to us?
SpongeBob:	 We'll probably get 40 lashes!
Patrick:	 Oh, no! 
SpongeBob:	 I'm sorry, Patrick. Mr. Krabs was right. There's no need for words like that.
Patrick:	 I'm sorry too, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr.Krabs.
Patrick:	  Agreed!
Mr. Krabs:	 All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for FOULING the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom.  Ow, Ooh! Ow! My  foot! What   genius puts a  rock in a  path?! Can't you see I got a  foot here?! Oh! 
SpongeBob:	 Five, six, seven...
Mr. Krabs:	 ...a whole lotta  and with a side of , a heapin' helpin' of  and a boatload of  ...
Patrick:	 Nine...
Mr. Krabs:	 ! 
SpongeBob:	  That's all 13, Patrick!!  We're gonna tell your mom, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	  No, please, not me mommy!  Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	  Mama Krabs, Mama Krabs!
Mama Krabs:	 Why, hello there!
SpongeBob:	 Mama Krabs, he said  and then he said  again and said  and then he screamed at the top of his voice ! And he----Mrs. Krabs, he didn't care! Such a stream of  I have never heard in my days!
Mama Krabs:	  Oh, dear! My poor old heart. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you?  You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!
Mama Krabs:	  You should all be ashamed! And if you're gonna talk like sailors, then you're gonna work like sailors!
Mama Krabs:	 I guess you three scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade! Ah-ga-ga-ga-ga!  Yeeeoww! My  foot!
Mr. Krabs:	  Mother!
Mama Krabs:	 What? It's Old Man Jenkins and his jalopy.
Old Man Jenkins:	 Howdy, Mrs. K! 
SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Mama Krabs:
