SpongeBob:	 Patrick! Tee time, Patrick! Patrick!  Tee time, Patrick!  Patrick! Wake up!
Patrick:	  Ready to lose? Weather permitting, of course.
SpongeBob:	 Aw, how are we supposed to golf in this this downpour? Our putters are getting waterlogged.
Patrick:	 Dumb rain! Doesn't anybody know I'm the sheriff in these parts? Hey, rain! You better stop that! 
Patrick:	  AAAAAAHHH!!!!!
Squidward:	  If you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble?
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Sorry, Squidward.
SpongeBob:	 I guess we were just too upset about the rain and how...
Squidward:	 Don't care.
SpongeBob:	  I was really looking forward to a day of sportsmanship and male bonding. Thanks a lot, rain! Hey, that gives me an idea.
Man with French accent:	 What follows is a brief construction montage.
Man with French accent:	 We hope you enjoyed this brief construction montage.
Squidward:	  Hey! Hello?! Nitwit, morons.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, hi, Squidward. Up from your slumber, I see. Well, you're just in time to endure in a friendly game of  indoor miniature golf!
Squidward:	 I will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two! Presently, I am heading to enjoy a well-deserved morning nap!
Patrick:	 But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five.
Squidward:	 I don't care! Listen up, I will not be woken from my nap again, and if I am, I'm gonna...
Patrick:	 Join us on the back nine?
Squidward:	 Just don't let it happen again! Or else. 
SpongeBob:	 Let's get this game teed off.  You're up first, my good man.
Squidward:	 Would you two KEEP IT DOWN?!
SpongeBob:	 Better tone down the calisthenics, Patrick. Don't wanna upset Squidward.
Patrick:	 Can't wait to lose, huh?  NO! Ooh. If you would just let me finish my stretches, I wouldn't have missed my first shot!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, don't worry, Patrick, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it.  Besides, we're just playin' for fun, right? And back, and- 
Patrick:	 Nice shot. 
SpongeBob:	 What are you doing?
Patrick:	 Moving my ball.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, you have to play it where it lands.
Patrick:	 Fine. Have it your way.  Ready to give up?
Patrick:	 Ha! Let's see how you do against the windmill. You haven't got a chance.
SpongeBob:	 You know, Patrick, this is just a game.
Patrick:	 Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win.
SpongeBob:	 I think you're missing the point. 
Patrick:	 Speaking of m-m-MISSING!  Ha! Gotta play it where it lands. Watch and learn, SquarePants. Watch and learn.  YES! See if you can top that!
SpongeBob:	  Okay.
Patrick:	  SpongeBob readies the approach shot. He's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey. A pressure-packed shot to be sure. 
Bikini Bottomites:	 Aw. 
Patrick:	 Looks like we're tied, three shots to three.
SpongeBob:	 Shots.  They're called strokes in golf, Patrick. Not shots.
Patrick:	 Whatever.  AND HE SINKS ANOTHER HOLE IN ONE! That's two in a row!
SpongeBob:	 All right. You wanna play competitive, eh? Observe.  Right between the old wickets. Come on bally, don't fail me now.
Patrick:	 Watch out for the water hazard.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, the only hazard I can see is you standing in my shot.
Patrick:	 I have no idea what you're talking about.
SpongeBob:	 Fine. Be that way. I'll just go around you. Oops.
Patrick:	 Show-off. I can do that. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, where did our balls go?
Patrick:	 Well, how do I know? I was just copying you.
SpongeBob:	  Uh-oh. Oh well, I guess that's game point.
Patrick:	 Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella. It's not over yet.
SpongeBob:	 But remember what Squidward said? We can't make any noise!
Patrick:	 Who said anything about noise? We're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course!
SpongeBob:	 Hey! Patrick. Patrick! What's the big idea? I thought we were in here to play golf, remember?
Patrick:	 Okay, okay!
SpongeBob:	 Now where is that darn ball?
Patrick:	 Oh!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, have you seen by ball?
Patrick:	 Was it a red one?
SpongeBob:	 M-hmm.
Patrick:	 It might have been in the kelp salad.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, you ate my ball?
Patrick:	 Don't worry, I'll get it.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, no!
Patrick:	 No?
SpongeBob:	 I have to play the ball where it lies.  You'll need to leave this open.  Now, let's see, if I was a golf ball, where would I-oh! Next to the gallbladder, of course. Fore!  Where's your ball?
Patrick:	 I don't know. Gotta be around here somewhere. 
SpongeBob:	 There it is!
Patrick:	 Uh-oh.
SpongeBob:	 Play it where it lies.
Patrick:	  Hole in one! Top that!
SpongeBob:	 I could do that blindfolded. 
Patrick:	 Wait up! Warmer. Warmer. Red hot!
SpongeBob:	  Aha!
Patrick:	 Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Red hot! Red hot!  Wait, My mistake. You're right. Oh, Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hot. Red hot. Red hot! SpongeBob, red hot!  Wrong again.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick... 
Patrick:	 Stop peeking! Hotter. Hotter! Hot! Hot! Cold. Hot. Cold. Hot! Cold.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick! This is ridic-  -ulous. Wow. Squidward's really let this place go. Patrick!
Patrick:	  AAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!
SpongeBob:	 What are you doing?
Patrick:	 I was just freshening up. These fancy fixtures are touchy  Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold!
SpongeBob:	 Would you please get back in the game?
Patrick:	 But I wanted to try his loofah.
SpongeBob:	 Those balls have gotta be around here somewhere. Oh, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Uhh, look a little closer, buddy.
SpongeBob:	  Play it where it lies?
Patrick:	 Play it where it lies.
SpongeBob:	 But how are we gonna hit our balls back to my house from here?
Patrick:	 All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob. All it takes is a little finesse.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, you're good to go.
Patrick:	 Fore!  It's all yours.
SpongeBob:	 This one's for all the marbles.
Patrick:	 But I thought we weren't betting.
SpongeBob:	 No, I mean whoever wins this hole wins the game. 
Squidward:	 What's going on here? 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Hole in one! 
SpongeBob:	 Good morning.
Patrick:	 Sorry we woke you.
Squidward:	  Wha-What? 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Squidward, what happened to your dentures?
Patrick:	 Good game, pal.
SpongeBob:	 Rematch next Saturday?
Patrick:	 Rain or shine, SpongeBob. Rain or shine.
Squidward:	  SpongeBob?!
