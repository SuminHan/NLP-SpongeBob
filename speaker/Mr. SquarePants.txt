Come on, SpongeBob, hurry, hurry, son, your mother has dinner waiting.
Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you we're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours?
Even Patrick has a license.
[angered] What's going on in here?!
Now if your klutzy mother can stop dropping her punch glass like she dropped that picture frame...
the only crime that ever happened at our house was the infestation of those worthless krill but they should be gone by now.
No, SpongeBob, your Cousin Blackjack has paid his debt to society and renounced his criminal ways. Never again will he litter.
Who ever knew he had such talent.
Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family.
Ahem.  Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!
Ta-da!
You took quite a buster there, Son.
We're gonna hafta hold off on the driving there for a while, son.
