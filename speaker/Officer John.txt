Well, well, well. What do we have here? A burglar bunny. Why do they do it, O'Malley?
You criminals make me sick.
Well, why didn't you say so? What a terrible misunderstanding!
Hey, wait a second, if you're throwing a party. Why weren't we invited?
Huh, can't bring him in in broken cuffs. I got an old pair in the car we can use.
Have you seen this man?!
And, uhh, take that cone off your head.
Hey, what are you kids up to this late?
A band, huh, well, that's, uh Oh.  Uh, you've got a, uh
Uh It's right
Just keep your nose clean, kid.
Litter!...  Ah Ha!
Hey you! Did you throw this gum away?
Ah... So you admit that you are a litterbug?
Oh, you sure did buddy. You disgust me... Maybe this will teach you not to treat the world as your own personal trash can!
Is this yours?

Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?
So you have the kicks to put your trash in other people's bins eh?
This is your statue?
Ready for duty, sir!
Stop thief!
Don't move!
Stop thief!
Well, well, well. If it isn't the art thief himself. Drop the spoon.  You're all under arrest until we figure this out.
Thanks for clearing this whole mess up, Mr. Krabs.
Wow, really? You are?
Hey watch your head. Oh, I never guess it.
Oh, uh nothing. Just with the rubbery arms and the doughiness in the midsection...
You sure are! And you have the right to remain silent! Or not silent...
Heads up! We got a live one...
Hold it there laddies, break this nonsense up right now.
Not so fast there, boy'o. There won't be a showdown. You lads know that's our turf.
We told you to stay off our turf lads!
Oh no, it's internal affairs!
What's the problem here?
Aha! A confession! Next time, think before you litter.
