The big guy.
What?
Quick, everybody into the...  Quick, everybody into the squad car.  Oh, darn it.
We shall have to chase him on foot.  It's headed straight for town.  There, by the magazine stand. Hold it right there, bub.  This is a newsstand, not a library.  Okay, one more step, and I'll sneeze.
We're prepared to do that.
You mean, that thing can speak?
That was...  beautiful. We still gotta run him out of town.
Hmph, snitch.
Let's get em, boys!
