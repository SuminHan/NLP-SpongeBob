Who is that little fellow with SpongeBob?
Yeah, he is handsome.  Ahem.
No. I don't like your attitude, bub. Is this what the Krusty Krab calls friendly service?
Now that's more like it. Finally, a server with a good attitude.
I'll take eight dozen of your finest patties, please. But don't let old chowder pants over there touch them. He might taint the patties.
Wow, honey, this new Mini Squid is such a card!
Yeah. You're right. So much better than that old, lousy, larger-scale Squidward.
