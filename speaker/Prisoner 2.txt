Kid's wasting his time.
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
It's a boat, you simpleton! What do boats do?
No!  You knucklehead! They float, away from this island, with all of us on board!  Now, here's the plan:  Hey, buddy! Need some help?
Sure!
Like a boat, upon the sea!
Ok, let's do it!
We're breaking out of here, yeah, that's what! Escapin'! Oh, uh thanks for the convincin' stage craft!
Turn the ship around!
Me, too! I'm innocent!
