Now, wait just a darn minute.
I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty. I want an adult size Krabby Patty.
Don't you see what you're doing. You're treating me like a child.
And that's another thing, I'm not a boy! I'm so old I got hairs growing out of the wrinkles in my liver spots.
I'm 68 years old and I want a Krabby Patty!
Feed this, old man!
I'm tired of playing second banana to a man who wears a bra! From now on, I want to be called Barnacle Man! And, I'm through protecting citizens that don't respect me!
Hey, who are those guys?
What do you want?
Well, we used to be. But now we're retired.
Would you please stop saying that?
Careful! Don't run!
What do you want from us?
Will you cut... will you stop calling me "boy?"
What's your point, kid?
Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when his nap is disturbed.
Confound it, get away from him!
It's not me, you ol' coot!
This better be good.
Gah! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. It's time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
There it is!  You know what this means?
Oh, brother.  Say the oath.
Mumbling mories. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
We did it, you ol' coot.
Remind you of what?
It's "bingo".
What is it this time, kid?
They can't be making a movie about us!
You bet it does, kid.
I knew this was a bad idea.
Well, our big moment, us up on the big screen.
Well, at least some of them.
I think it's time to go home, Mermaid Man.
I'll tell you about it in the morning. Now, drive!
Yup.
And a decent latrine.
There you are, young man.
Next.
Of course.
There you go.
Anytime, boys.
It's stay away from the path of evil.
Oh.
Hello.
Hey! Those aren't super villains.
Those aren't super villains. It's just that kid, uh, SpongeBob and his goofy friend. Hey kid, can you give us our Mermerang back? We only got the one.
Oh don't throw...
Ya, it does that.
No! Ahhh! Umph! Oh!
Look I'll just come and get...
What is wrong with you?
Would you get off of me?!
Umph! What are you two doing here anyway?!
Barnacle Boy here.
Yes but...
Yes, yes commissioner... But, uh.
The police commissioner needs us to be celebrity contestants at the Bikini Bottom Shuffle Boarding Competition. But there's no way we can do it in this condition!
What!? Why should we trust you two!?
So!
Ohhhh... All right. I suppose they can't do too much damage. It's just shuffle boarding... umph!
Would you cut it out?!
Now listen up! Here, take these rings.
And when you touch 'em together, you will be instantly transformed into our duplicates.
When you're through with shuffle boarding, you are to bring those costumes right back here! And don't do anything else! Don't go home first, don't show your friends, just come right back here! You got it?!
This'll never work.
You are to bring those costumes right back here! Don't do anything else!
Faster you ol coot!
Hey were stuck here remember?
Because you forgot to fill up the boat mobile before we left. See?
Yes. Thank you boys we dont usually do this but in term for pushing the invisiboat of those hills. Theres something I'd like you to see, but you must promise to not touch anything.
[sighs] It contains all the member billion up from our super human adventures.
Correct!
Scared boys?
Well don't be.
And this is our time machine. This device allows us to transport into the future or past at a date or destination of our choosing.
Unfortunately, the consequences of altering the order of history are so dangerous; we chose it to leave it alone so you mustnt touch...
No!
You fool you realized what youve done?
Maybe as you knew it, but this is a different Bikini Bottom of another time. Maybe if they've hadnt touched the time machine like we told you Patrick, we wouldnt be in this mess. Hopefully we hadnt changed anything with our presence.
What went wrong?
When are we going to have those two classified as villains?
Thanks I... uh...
Yes?
Im just taking stuff in a wasted life.
I hate to break up the memorial service but were out of tartar sauce out here.
The Dirty Bubble? What's he doing at the bus stop?
That's right, Mermaid Man!
Holy...
Great Guppies, Mermaid Man! We gotta do something!
Greet the hottest crime fighter in the country!  Professor Magma!
Step aside, you copious cod! My beef is with the bubble!
Nuclear Touch!
Great Gravy! What just happened?
Oh, boy.
Do you mind telling us what you're doing here?
I hate to break it to you kids, but you'll have to go somewhere else. Our power got knocked out in the storm.
Not the beginning of time, Mermaid-Brain. They want to know how we became a crime-fighting duo.
What are you talking about?
You're supposed to be telling the story of how we became superheroes!
Wake up, you old coot. Finish the story.
No, no, no...  the reason I teamed up with this joker is because I was stuck breathing underwater for the rest of my life.
Anyway, from that day forward, we became
Oh yes it did!
Oh, ha ha, lot you remember. You don't even remember where you live.
Oh, feels just like yesterday, doesn't it, Mermaid Man?
Hmm... Oh, so what do you boys think? Boys?
All in a day's work ehh, Mermaid Man?
Uhh, Mermaid Man?
We're not in the invisible boat mobile, are we?
I told you making the boatmobile invisible was a stupid idea.
It's gotta be around here somewhere?  Ow! Oh, Mermaid Man, I think I...
Ignition...on.
...and Barnacle...  ... Boy.
Oh, please. He's not disfigured. He's-he's just that sponge kid again.
Look, there has to be danger. You blew the Conch Signal. When you blow the... where'd you get that thing anyway?
Look, Spongy, that ain't no toy.
But you only blow it when there's trouble, or there'll be trouble. You got that?
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. They're serving meatloaf today.
Will you hurry up in there? And save me some hot water!
[Crushed] Coming! [they both jump on couch where it lunges them on their faces. Later, shows SpongeBob lying on the floor, Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy arrive, Barnacle Boy sees that Mermaid Man's towel is gone so he gives him a new one]
What? I come down in my underwear to open a jar of mayonnaise?
But nothing. We can't go around socializing, we have to be prepared for, uh, emergencies.
Alright, O.K. You can blow The Conch every once in a while. Just give us something to do when we show up.
That's it. Gimme that.  You're running us ragged.
We're exhausted.
It's too late for that, Mr. Contest Winner. I'm gonna destroy this thing with my sulfur vision.  Well I'll destroy it when I get back to the, uh, Mermalair. Uh, and as for you...
You don't even remember breakfast, you old coot.
What?
Drive? What do you know about driving the Invisible Boatmobile?
Don't touch that button, that's the...  ... Origami button.
Uh, uh, say, kid, why don't you take this nickel and go up there and see if our theme song in on the jukebox?
Let's ditch him.
Oh, it's there all right.
Dagnabbit.
Where did we park the Invisible Boatmobile?
It's the Dirty Bubble!
Yeah, you're a hero.
Watch Out!
But how?
I dunno.
No.
Yeah, yeah, follow me.
Now, we want you boys to keep an eye on the place. Water the plants, and make sure that...
Especially not the invisible boat mobile. When we say don't touch anything, we mean don't touch anything. Do you understand?
Well, great. Here are the keys.  We'll see you in a week.
I told you I'm not hungry, Mermaid Man!
What a dive.
It's not for the toy, I just...I've gotta fit in the tights, y'know?
Listen big nose,  this guy has been saving your butt since before you were born. Don't you got a living legend discount or something?
Well next time danger threatens, don't expect any help from us!
Holy sea cow, it's that Sponge-kid!
Where'd we park?
Eee-Ow!  I told you we shoulda' got the automatic!
Floor it!
You're Mermaid Man, you old coot!
But this is ridiculous!
