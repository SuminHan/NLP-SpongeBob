Drum Solo!
Drum solo!
Nosy neighbors. A Krabby boss. Squidward needed to leave this town.
So Squidward packed his clarinet and for days could not be found. His Krusty friends were so upset. What's that sound? That's nasal sound? Wait a minute turn around! Squidward's back! Squidward's back with his very own show and this time it's all about the squid! He's gonna teach an art class, take a bubble bath. Shake his Tentacles, take another bubble bath! Happy days at the Krusty Krab. Hey there Squid, you're looking totally fab. Squidward's back! Squidward's back! You thought that he was gone, but oh, no, Squidward's back! Squidward's got his own show. Save some room for a clarinet solo!
Squidward's back!
Squidward's back!
Squidward's back!
Squidward's back!
Squidward's back!
Squidward's baaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
