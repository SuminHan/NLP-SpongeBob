Afternoon, son.
Son, we're looking for the maniac.
Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy, understand?
Okay.
Stay indoors, son.
Hey you! Yeah, you in the chair!
: You have a visitor.
:  What happened to prisoner 665321?!
Hey, Twinkle Toes, you're in a no dancing zone. Now beat it.
What can I do for you, boys?
Well, it appears these two stole a balloon.
Okay, follow me.  If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.  Okay, time's up.  Now, get out.
Yeah, on Free Balloon Day.
