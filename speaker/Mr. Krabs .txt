Oh... that's ok, honey. We weren't going there anyway. THAT'S where we're going!
Shoes...
Oh, give me a break, Mr. Complainsalot! As if you would know anything about running a restaurant!
See you fellows tomorrow! Gourmet know-how!
I don't value you at all!
This is mutiny! And the public is actually eating it! Well, at least our loyal clientele haven't jumped on the chum wagon.
Well, I could be asking you the same thing, boy.
Never noticed it.
Say, kiddo, why don't see if you can't get old Kenny and his throng of fans to visit the old Krusty Krab for a while?
One at a time, one at a time, please! Kenny the Cat will have time to meet each and every one of you's. And I will have time to take each and every one of your dollars. Look at myself. I'm not being a very good host. Uh,excuse me. You just make yourself at home, Kenny. I mean, Mr. the Cat. Here you go! Condiments. On the house. Don't tell anybody. Welcome to the Krusty Krab family.
No! Come back! Aw, thanks a lot, you air-breathing charlatan! And you can forget about these free condiments too!
SpongeBob, me boy! It's time to give them a crash course in Krabby Patty making.
