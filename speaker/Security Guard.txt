Come on, boy. Let's go. The store is empty, so go ahead and lock 'er up, Frank.

Sir, may I help you?
Uh, yes. SpongeBob is not here right now, sir.
Sir, please step away from the gate.
Uh huh.  Oh. You're here for the Casting Department.
In that case, please step right inside sir.
I'm not sure, sir.
This way, sir.
This way, sir.
This way, sir.
Walk this way, sir.
Here you are, sir. Please wait here while you wait.  Can I get you anything, sir?
This way, sir.
Ahh. Don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Uh... yeah.
Eh, barnacle nickels! Uh, can I help you ladies?
There ain't no tellers. ATM's outside.
Wait a minute! I don't care if you are ladies! Nobody pretends to rob my bank!
