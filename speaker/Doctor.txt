Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery.
Your butt's all better. It's really quite amazing.  It took 20 hours to put it all back together. We actually ran out of staples and had to use a glue stick. Yep, you're a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, luck boy. But from now on, Id like you to be more careful. One more injury like that and you could wind up like that poor creature there. In the Iron Butt.
Mr. Krabs is in a cash-coma. Only the return of his money can save his life.
Oh no, this is horrible.
This man has no insurance.
You're right, nurse. Extract the patient to the hallway. Stat!
Administrator Flotsam, what can I do for you?
Yes, yes he is.
Not to worry. Nurse!
Nonsense. Your laugh should be stronger than ever.
Yes, but uhh, one of your friends generously allowed us to transplant part of theirs to you.
Congratulations, Mrs. Smith. You gave birth to a healthy baby boy.
Of course.
Theres no easy way to say this. SpongeBob, if I were you, I would give serious consideration to start thinking about a replacement spatula.
Go home. Get some rest. Well try to do everything we can.
Oh, I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor whose searching for a role. Yes! Woohoo! I am so totally gonna get this part.
I would give serious consideration to...  a replacement spatula.
SpongeBob, I-I hate to tell you this...
Actually, it's not that. I didn't get the acting part.
Oh, by the way, that's not your spatula. Your buddy's all patched up in the infirmary.
Well, that's odd. Who's that?
What's he got there?
I don't know how he got in there, but the gases inside this shell are making the little guy hallucinate. He would've smelled the gases if he had a nose like most good-hearted people.
What happened?
Boo-boos, eh? Hmmm... I think you guys want that hospital.
