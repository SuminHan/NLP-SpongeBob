What was that?
Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?
A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge.  Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny!  Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook.  No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no...  Ah!
A purveyor of foods.  Yes, you must be my new fry cook.
Then who pulled out the spatula?
It is even funnier a second time!  You there, crustacean!
You have the physique of Atlas!
Make poses with me!
You pulled the spatula from the grease!
This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook?  Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know how to cook a burger to suit a royal palate!  What? Am I expected to believe that this creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof?  Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.
The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed.
Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear.  No, blue.  Uh, The royal fry cook's wallet contains...  His big toes are...  Uhh, he has six...
Silence!
So, little one, you think you have what it takes to become my royal fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!
Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.
Three challenges!
Enough!
There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!
Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him.
And now, see the fate that may lie ahead.  For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great.  Behold!  Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold!  My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!
But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?
Very well then. To the Poseidome!
I win!  Loser!  Free patties for everyone!  Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious!  Ooh.
Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better?  Give me that!  Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time!
Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win.
You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?
No, of course not.
Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.
Come SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart...  to Atlantis!
It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it!  Maybe we do have a problem.
The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thy own wrath, stove!  Haha!
Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic.
So I say, "Look, Zeus, either you come up with more money or Neptune walks."
Let us battle!  Take that!
"Property of SpongeBob?"
Uh-oh.
Well, maybe I can help. I believe I have something of yours.
That is my trident!
You have been one naughty trident!
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
Now let's see if we can fix all of this.
You know, SpongeBob, your spatula is just as powerful as my trident.
Ha! Not even close!  But it's still pretty great.
Well, there is one way.
There they are!
Prepare to burn, Krabs.
Very well, then. Before I turn this conniving crustacean into fishmeal, who here has anything to say about Eugene Krabs?
Anyone else? No? Well, then.
And now, Eugene Krabs,  you... will...
Quiet, fool! Mr. Krabs stole my crown, and now it's in Shell City. That's why he must die.
You don't understand. My crown is a symbol of my king-like authority. And between you and me... my hair is thinning a bit.
[] All right, all right.
You, go to Shell City?   No one who's gone to Shell City has ever returned. What makes you think you could? You're just a kid.
Run along. I have a crab to cook.
Very well, then. I'll have to fry you both!
Mindy, I told you to stay in the carriage.
But, daughter, I...
All right. Very well, Mindy. I'll give him a chance. But when your little champion fails to return, I get to splatter this crab all over the walls.
And as for you, be back here with my crown in exactly 10 days!
8!
6!
Six it is, then.
Until then, the crab shall remain frozen where he now stands!
Come along, Mindy.
