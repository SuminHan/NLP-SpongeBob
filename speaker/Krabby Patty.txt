What?
Hey, SpongeBob. I heard your brain was sick, so I brought you this cookie pizza.
And here's some chocolate milk.
Just remember, SpongeBob, I'll always be with you right here  .
Actually, in your arteries. Now, do me a favor and wake up. Wake up.
Hey! Psst! It's me! The patty!
It's just me and you out here, now. So, just do it. Eat me.
Oh, forget Food Con. You're starving and I'm right here.
Of course, I'm right. I'm a talking sandwich.
