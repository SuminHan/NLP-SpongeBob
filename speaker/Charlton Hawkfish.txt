I designed every pipe, gasket, and cesspit beneath this stadium.
Crupski, you told me you wouldn't cut corners on my plans!
What's this?  You've added the reducer into a five-foot main line!
That pipe's to small! It'll never hold!
And what's this? The pipe is made out of cardboard?!
It's five minutes 'til half-time! Do you know what that means?
The half-time wave man! When every toilet flushes at once, the sewers can't take it! It's madness!
Egads!
Too much flushing! She's gonna blow!  How's she holding up?
The pinch point!
Gaskets blown, manifold mangled, backflow everywhere!
You flushed it all away, Crupski! You two better hope that fail safe I installed works!
Good thing today was Free Axe Day at the stadium.
This is what you get when so-called fish kind and all its humorous and ignorance stooped so low!  As to cut corners and its plumbing system! Extinction is the result of being cheap!
At least we didn't waken the great sewer snake.  Check that?
