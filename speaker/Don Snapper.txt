Hello, I'm Don Snapper. And welcome to Fish Food Rescue, the show where I snap on disgusting food establishments. Today, we're going somewhere we've never gone before. The Krusty Krab. Let's see how krusty this place is.
Wow! This place seems spotless from bow to stern! How about the krustomer's satisfaction?
Satisfaction duly noted. But how about the busyness of the business?
Holy fishpaste! You keep selling those and you'll never go out of business!
But how about your competition?
Barnacles! This place is serving plank-tons of filth!
I don't embrace excuses. We need to shut it down!
Shut it down! I'm Don Snapper. Tune in next time when we try and save the Chum Bucket. Trust me. I'm a professional expert.
