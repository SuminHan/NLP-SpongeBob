Who dares trespass upon me haunted houseboat?
Aye. And what man or beast might you too be?
Robots? Puppets? Pizza parlors?!
What? Sing for ye?
So you want me to sing ye a shanty, eh?
And you do not think I'm a real ghost, do ye?
Oh, oh, oh, I'll sing ye a song, all right! A song so terrifying, you'll have to believe I'm a ghost!
Hit it, fingers!
Do you believe we're real ghosts now?
Pizza? I'll give you a pizza!
Ha-ha-ha-ha! So ye finally believe, eh? Cursed swabs!
Eh, great friend you have here!
Eh, that's funny you should ask. Usually, when I come to town, it's to terrify the population and enslave their souls in eternal torment! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Yeah, but this time we just blew a head gasket.
Not us, you imbecile! Our engine room broke down.  Hey, Charlie, you got the busted head gasket out yet?
Say, maybe you two morons... Um, fine gentlemen, could pick up a new one for us!
Yes, you! And just as a little incident to make you return , I'll take your souls as deposit!
Here's a shiny doubloon to buy a new gasket. Succeed and maybe you'll get another doubloon! If you aren't back in 24 hours, your souls are mine and you'll be part of my ghastly crew, um, , let's see here, three weeks from Thursday... forever!
Oh, why certainly!
Such a polite lad!
Who dares touch me gold?
A deal's a deal and I'm a man of me word. Here you go, square one.
Think fast, pink one!
Har-har-har. Those weren't your souls. Those were just a couple of old orange sodas that have been sitting in the sun too long!
Eh, I never had 'em. Everyone knows you can't hold onto a wild soul. Well, now that that's settled, there's still a little matter of...  Me gold! Stop right there! No one touches me booty and gets away with it.
Ha-har-har-har. Welcome to the Void! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-har-har-har-har!
Ha-ha-ha... And if I don't, what'll ye do about it, me bubble-headed lassy?
Oh! The big chipmunk's gonna get us! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Not so fast! That there booty be mine!
You mean my gold!
Nah, nah! We used to be part of the Dutchman's crew. We stole his gold hundreds of years ago! But the Dutchman hasn't found us yet. And he never will!
The Dutchman! How did he track us down? Unless, thar be a snitch aboard!
Why, you scurvy little scum-scrubber! You've ruined everything!
Dutchman! Boy, am I glad we finally found you!
Stole your gold? We just went out to get pizza!
Um, we got lost? But we've been looking for ye ever since... to give ye back your treasure!
Ha-ha-ha! Eh, that Dutchman was always a sap!
Eh, now that the engine's fixed, the Dutchman will never catch up with aye.  Boiler room, we're losing power! Report! The engine's on fire, sir!
We're going down! Brace for impact!
Welcome to the Kursed Krab! How may we serve you this eternity?
Aargh, it's right over there.
