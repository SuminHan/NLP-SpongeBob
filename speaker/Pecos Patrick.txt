He's a' coming! Dead Eye's a' coming!
I'll tell you who Dead Eye is! But I shall do it through song. Maestro, if you please.  Oh, Bikini Gulch was a purdy place with sweet water and blue sky. 'Til one day a beast 'come a-riding from the east by the name of Ol' Dead Eye.
Oh, he's robbed this town, he's pulled my pants down!
And if you think that's funny, let me tell you, sonny, you won't be laughing when you SEE...  HIS...  BIG...  RED...  DEAD EYE!
Ooo...
Aw, again?
Oh, hey SpongeBuck! Those guys are a barrel of laughs, huh? But lazy! Anyway, you've got to get back and save the town, sheriff!
Out west, a man gets right back up on his coffin and faces his problems with the help of his idiot sidekick friend! That's me!  Duhhh...
Hop on, buddy!
Don't worry. I got a short-cut. He-ya!
We're heroes!
Why are you all standing in your pajamas? No, don't tell me. Oh, I know! You're throwing a slumber party! Pillow fight!
It's made out of wood,  like all pillows in the old west. Round 2?
Looks like it's just you and me, kid.
Uh huh,
Uh huh, uh huh,
Three yee-haws for SpongeBuck!
Well, sheriff, you beat Dead Eye Plankton and saved the town.
Come with me, I want to show you something.
So, what are we gonna sing about, SpongeBuck?
What kind of friends, SpongeBuck?
Who picks you up and slaps you all around?
Idiot Friends, Idiot Friends--
Duh, duh duh duh du duh duh do.
Dah de da da da da da do.
De da da da-doodle, duh do. You know SpongeBuck, all we've been singing about is what I've done for you. Well, what have you done for me?
Thanks, buddy!
Only an idiot friend would do that!
Okay.
Who slaps you hard and often?
What'd you say?
