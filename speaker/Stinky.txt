Now, what can I do for you young 'uns?
Oh, now, now, kids. There's plenty of burgers for everyone.
Well, which one is it, kids? Do you like me or respect me?
Ok, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me.
Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night? If it's burgers you want, go around back.
Ok, that's enough, kids. Gather around, children. There's something I want to tell you. What I have to say is very important. If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy.  Do you two have kelp for brains? Don't you understand? If you two yahoos come around, you'll drive away all the normal customers. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a li-spectable business. As it is, I can barely afford the essential things in li...  Is it quitting time already?  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy some of life's essentials.
