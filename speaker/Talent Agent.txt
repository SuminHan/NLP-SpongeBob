Stop, stop! Don't gnaw on the head of my new client, please? You don't know what you're doing. Are you mad? Have mercy!
Salutations! I'm Milo J. Finkerfish: manager for "Curly Bubbles Records".
That was very cute, girls.  In fact, it's too cute. You're out.
Let's see who's next. Hmm...  SpongeBob SquarePants. Oh, SpongeBob SquarePants!  SpongeBob?! I guess he's not here. It's too bad, he was good. But who could replace a dancer of such high-caliber?
Really?  Well, I'll be  judge of that.
Oh, sweet sassafras! Do mine eyes deceive me? That was the greatest routine since the greatest thing since sliced bread dancing routine!  Congratulations!  You got the gig!
I don't think you'll be sorry either, because you'll be dancing in...  ...Squilliam's show!
