Hello.
Who is this?
Oh, I don't know any pirates anymore. Are you sure you have the right number?
Sure.
I'm not much for singing, but I love SpongeBob. Who else is going to be performing?
Oh, Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob?
Well, you said SpongeBob is going to be on the show.
But, he's a cartoon, so you mean the guy who does the voice, right?
Mrs. Turner? Oh, no, this isn't Tina Turner. This is Tina Fey.
