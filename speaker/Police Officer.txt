Not so fast!  This card says "This was all my idea. Love, Squidward." If Mr. Krabs doesn't pull through, you're going to jail.
Why? What he'd do? Rob a bank?
Oh-kay.
He could be right under our noses!  Umm Frank, where's your mustache?
Oh, no, you're not. We've got a special cell for you.
Then you're gonna love this one.
What do you make of it, Sarg?
Don't worry little girl! We're working as fast as we can!
I don't know, slow day at the office, huh?
Ok, forget what I just said.
Sponge, pull over!
All right, kid, what was that all about?
Yeah. I never even knew some of those things myself.
Wait, wait, Miss Chuckles, did you say you were his boating instructor?
Under meanal code 26-1 quote, "The boating instructor is responsible--"
Unquote. I'm afraid we're gonna have to take you in, ma'am.
Sir, is this your vehicle?
And did I just see you let a snail negotiate this vehicle through a dangerous intersection?
By putting a snail behind the wheel.
Are you a licensed driving instructor, sir?
No, I'm married to my job.
Well, we've had our ups and downs, but after some couples counseling, we think we've worked out our issues.
Oh, this is going to require something more than money, sir.
