Oh, I think there must be something wrong with me, Thomas.
Nope. The Christmas Channukah, Kwaanza, and Winter Solstice are coming but I'm not happy.  I just don't understand Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, and Winter Solstice, I guess. I like getting presents, sending cards and decorating trees, and spinning dradles, and getting chocolate money, and having harvest feast, and...
Ok, guys. I gots a tree, a menorah, and corn. But I still gots one question: Isn't there anyone who knows what Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, Winster Solstice is all about?
