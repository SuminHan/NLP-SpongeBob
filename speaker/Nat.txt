Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our live coverage of this year's annual spring classic, the 102nd Running of the Snail. And what a beautiful day for this sport of kings, of which I am a huge fan. Seriously, I'm just a fan. I was on my way to my seat, the door was open.
We all had dreams.
Good riddance, dreamer!
They're floating in midair!
Sure.  It's, uh, ten to three.
Don't mention it.
Uh, who said that?
Ghosts!
What?! You mean you kidnapped us just to sell us your fast food?
You little twerp.
She looks so peaceful.
Oh, brother, I hated the real version of this song.
Help! Lunatic driver!
Hold on a second, there's your tickets in your back pockets.
Is he hurt?
Neptune's turned up quite a gale tonight. He must be mad about something.
Nooo!  Why, Dear Neptune?
I wasn't shoving. I was going like that and you happened to be standing there.
No, it isn't.
Nope.
Nope!
Boo!
Excuse me, sir, but, um, I ordered a couple Krabby Patties a while ago, and I'm wondering when they'll be out.
What's your secret Larry?
Larry, how can they redeem their worthless lives?
Huh?
Oh, don't pretend you don't love it.
Craig Mamalton?
Dust my attic?
He helped me build a... a...
Hello.
Sorry, I just wanted a Chum Stick.
Yes, I'd like one of your Chum Sticks.
No, I'm serious, I want a Chum Stick.
Now this was so good. I'm going to have to come back, tomorrow.  Here you go. See you in the morning.
Hey.
I came back like I said yesterday.
I'd like another Chum Stick, please?
Oh, boy!
Okay?  It's perfection!  Hey, how about I have another.
Whoo, boy! I can not believe how good these things are.
All right, see you tomorrow.
Oh, you know it! And the day after that, and the next week after that! You've got a regular customer on your hands!
Hey Plankton, can I get another one of your delicious Chum Sticks?
No thanks.
Yeah, do me a favor.  From now on, keep those Shabby Patties to yourself.
Nope.
Hey, this doesn't look like Chum.
How many times do I have to tell you? I don't want to eat your trash! Plankton's chum is my favorite breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I LOVE CHUM! So forget it! I don't want to eat anything else!
Yeah! That's right!
A shortcut to the Chum Bucket? Hmm. That must be for me.
This isn't the Chum Bucket.
That's okay, I only eat Chum Bucket brand Chum.
It's...
It's...
It's the second foulest thing I've ever tasted!  I'm going back to Plankton's Chum.
Not this time!
Not ever again! The deal's off, computer! I can't eat another bite of that slop, no matter how much you pay me!
I have eaten ten of those things, and I've all ready had to go to the doctor, twice!  If you need me, I'll be getting my stomach pumped, again.
Ha! Nobody reads the Examiner, bud. It's all full of boring charts and facts!  The Bottomfeeder's where it's at! It's got like interesting stories and stuff.
I don't know. But they're selling!
Whoa!
You hear a noise?
Next time i'm picking the restaurant.
I paid to see two guys get maimed.
Wait a minute, eating chum? Do people do that?
Yeah. I'll gonna have two Krabby Patties.
We couldn't find parking over at the Krusty Krab.
All I know is: Chum is Fum.
Yeah, but the slogan is so catchy that we can't stop eatin' it.
Uhh...something's not right.
I'm outta here.
I'm so happy that they changed that old tired slogan, "Chum is Fum".
Way cooler!
What?
Where? I don't see anything!
Oh okay, I see it!
That sounds delicious!
Hold it, what's that sign say?
I'll tell you what it means! It means this!
Hey, my Krabby Patty doesn't have ketchup.
Yeah, me too!
He's done. Order.
Oh, there's furthermore.
I wanna throw something at him!
Excuse me, I think your ice machine's broken.
Uh, you're the owner here, aren't you?
Well, I think your ice machine might be broken.
Excuse me, the ice machine's broken.
What? Where?  Hey, thanks buddy.
Boy, good thing I remembered my umbrella.
I'm holding the door for the nice lady!
Mount Bikini Bottom's erupting!
Me too!
It's so expensive!
It's such an honor to meet you!
I heard they have better weather over there.
Hey, what did he just say it was?
Oh... I thought he said freaks. In that case...  So glad I actually left my house today.
Hey, he's making a run for it! We can't let him get away with this! Let's get up and... ..get him.
Hey, what's all the hubble?
You!
Let him go, it's too late.
Wow, Frank never dances, it must be good!
These are my savings! Just give us more Krabby Patties!
Wow, new approved.  Wow, that's fantastic!
I refuse to be served by a sick fry cook.
42?
Hey, Mr. Krabs! Why are your patties dangerous?
Kid's got a point.
I'll give you $1,000 for the stench-vision goggles.
FREE MONEY! [Angrily, he turns a boat to the other side then joins everyone else. The boat catches on fire and explodes.
My face! My face! Also my leg. But mostly my face!
Hey, Squid guy! Where's my lunch?
Oh, it's great! Just great!
I just love this Krabby Patty!
My Krabby Patty is a Krabby Patty and both buns are also Krabby Patties!  So luxurious!
No extra. It's the same low price as a regular Krabby Patty.
Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.
Well, I didn't see anything.  Hey, where'd that other guy go?
Hey, that was pretty good.
Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown?
Morning.
Oh, you don't like that idea? Then we'll sacrifice
Oh, isn't this cooking? Sorry.
You!
You think this is funny?
Well, Mr. Funny Man, is this how you get your sick kicks?!
Dude, put that thing away. There are, like, children here.
Hey, SpongeBob, I.
I'll give you $100,000, in cash, for said hat.
Hey! The poor sap's not kidding. Didn't you hear? They found a whole warehouse full of them. They're worthless.
Now that's worth a million dollars. Hey, kid, wait up!
