Hello.
Phew! Cramped in there.
Cousin SpongeBob!
Uncle Sherm said I should come visit you. I have a note from him somewhere. Oh, right. It's in here.  Here it is.
Wow! You've got your own refrigerator. I'm not allowed near the fridge at Uncle Sherm's.  Whoa!
Yahahaahoo!
Your toilet is so cool! Is that what I think it is?
TV...
Uncle Sherm never let me watch TV at home.
That's why... What's that?
You work at the Krusty Krab!?
Oh! Who's that!
I wish I had a calling.
You really think so?
We're related.
Your friend Squidward seems busy.
Nice to meet you too, Sa...  Whoa!
Nothing.
Yep.
Clear my mind. Do nothing.  I can't do it!
Can I try?
I can even do nothing right.
No!
No.
Ooh! Can I touch it?
Hey, my first customer. Hi, I'm Stanley! Ohhh! This is so exciting!
Wait! Wait!  I don't want to ever forget this moment! That's gonna be a keeper. Now let's do one with funny hats!  Ooh! Let's pretend we're mad at each other!
He's right! I ruin everything I touch!
Thanks! I bet I'll be even better in this one!
Morning, boss.
Sorry, boss.
