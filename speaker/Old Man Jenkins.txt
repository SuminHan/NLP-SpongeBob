Wait, what's going on? Whoa, whoa!
If you could pull out your eye and put it on him, wouldn't that make... you a zombie too?
Who's to say we're not all zombies?!
I hope so. Neptune knows I did.  Oof!
Oops.  I missed a spot.
I just been looking for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie.
Why, I'd be happy to!
I just can't decide what to order.
Don't rush me, young lady!
Oh, why thank you very much, young man.
Locked in again.
I want my Krabby Flabby!
Delicious!
Oh why, why, why?  Why won't you let me on the ride?
But it's my birthday!
Don't rush me, woman!
Don't start.
I like it.
Hello.
Where are we goin' now, boys?
What the?
And that old whip shhhhooo the coins just flew from the machine!
Why are you two asking about the Main Drain?
Ohhhh, it exists alright. But it's been...uhhh... hushed up.
I have no idea.
My spine!
I'll sue!
:  Hey, I'm still here.
I'll have me a Rusty on Rye please.
Stop giving me the round around city boy! I want a Rusty on Rye and nothing less!
Huh? Oh, let's see, um, I think it was on rye bread, it was #9 on the menu, it came with a side of something or other...
This ain't no kinda way to treat a loyal customer!
I'm not a very strong swimmer.
Oh, dear, where is that nickel?  Huh? Why are you laughing?
What's the holdup?
And mine!
I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention.
Howdy, Mrs. K!
Oh! Pardon me, young lady.  What a fox.
Eh, eh... I hope I don't miss again.
I don't want to be a burden.
What did I miss?
Hey, you!
Hey! I saw you on TV last night.
Yeah. You were on a commercial.
Yup. See ya later, Bran Flakes. What a nice cereal box.
