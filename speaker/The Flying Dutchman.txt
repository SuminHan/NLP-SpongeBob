Excuse me, Davy, I've got my first blind date in 400 years, and I've got to look good.  It's a little torn. Of course this was the shirt I was buried in. Ahhh, memories!  Bleah!  Okay, that one's a bit ripe. Stained. Too itchy! Hey, there she is! I've been saving this beauty for a special occasion!  Sssss! Looking good!  Who dares--  Who--  --disturb--  --The Flying--  --Dutchman?!  My beard! Hey!  Who dares disturb the Flying Dutchman?!
I don't look like The Flying Dutchman, because...  You morons cut off my beard!
I don't want to look younger! I hate youth! I'll probably get pimples again.
You know nothing about me facial hair. It'll take a thousand years for my beard to grow back!
Well, now's the time you've learned. Until my beard grows back, I'm going to turn you two fools into ghosts. Prepare to be ghostified!
Okay, you're having too much fun. .
You're ghosts!
This isn't really working out the way I imagined.
Well, at least I still have my personality.
Hmm, I guess you feel my pain. Well, I'll lift the curse from ya.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The curse will wear off when my beard grows back.
Well, I want to be on my date, now! But, you knuckleheads loused that up, too!
Thanks, fellas! I love the new beard. Well, I'm off on my date. Don't wait up.
I can't do it. She wants to marry me! I ain't the marrying type.  Aaaahhh!
