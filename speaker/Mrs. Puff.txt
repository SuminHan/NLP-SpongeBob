No.
Oh yes, everything is quite lovely.  Eww, although I don't care for his taste of paintings.
Hello class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?
Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous.
We just want to know your name.
Oh great, another genius...
Today's first lesson will be on turning.
That's enough! Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention.
Now then, "Turning"; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least...
What about the teacher?  As if I really look like this!  SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions.
I'm sorry SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle.
You'll get this star back when you earn it...
SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room.
Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go!
Perhaps this would be a good time for recess.
What's going on here?!  Well?
Fighting?  Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend  to detention!
May Neptune have mercy on your souls.
Good job, boys!  I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork! I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School.
Double-dark deep-sea light diet cake!  You will soon be mine.  Oh!  Ghosts!
Oh!
That's impossible. In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class.
You don't understand. SpongeBob is unteachable.
Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school. Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating?
Then what do you do?
Yes.
Drive the boat.
No, SpongeBob, you failed.
I won't be teaching SpongeBob anymore?  No more... SpongeBob? I thought this day would never come. Goodbye, SpongeBob! Have a nice life. "[Flies away]" Free at last, Free At Last!
Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob.
It's okay. Mr. Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back.  And your dossier was destroyed in the explosion,  so it's as if you never failed.
I wish I had a snazzy new boat. I wanna be a hot rod momma.
What do you think of my new hot rod?
No.
Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day!  Let's see here. This weeks hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm...  ...SpongeBob.  It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor.
Ohh... Phil?
Uhh, Tina, you're the hall monitor.
B...uh...B-Beth!
Henry?  Vera?  Clayton?  Alright, I guess I have no choice.  The hall monitor of the day is  SpongeBob.
Okay! Just take the hat and belt.
You can't make this easy, can you?
Give me a break.
SpongeBob, are you okay?
I'm afraid so.
Uhh... SpongeBob?
I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.
What are the consequences of what I've just done?
SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself!
Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility.  Uh-oh...  And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...
I'd like to see you after class. Six months from now.
Good morning.
Actually, I am. Let the testing begin!
Certainly.  SpongeBob?
SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late?  Whatever this is...  ...it's going on your permanent record!
Good day, future motorists. I'm Mrs. Puff, state accredited boating instructor. Today, we'll be discussing the differences between a driver with boat smarts.
And a driver without boat smarts.
Let's see some examples, shall we? Tire Pressure.  Before you can even think about boating, the boater who uses boat smarts always fills his tires to the appropriate level.  While this driver pays no need to boat smarts. [cut to Squidward putting on safety belt][drives off but stops slowly at a stop light][cut to SpongeBob driving his boat through town destructively without wearing his seat belt and laughing][Squidward screams as SpongeBob slams into the backend of Squidward's boat, sending him flying into the air still in his seat and buckled up with the steering wheel in his hand. Squidward screams more as he sees a spiky steamroller driving on the road he is flying into. He tries to get his seat belt off but squeezes through the spikes anyways][The boat, now cut in half, comes out of the steamroller and in it is Squidward, all injured. His seatbelt pops off.] Adjusting Your Mirrors. What's our boat smarts boater up to now?  You guessed it. He's adjusting his mirror before he begins boating, unlike this degenerate boater.
Finally, and most importantly, a driver with boat smarts always pays attention to his surroundings and avoids distractions. Notice how this driver's eyes are locked firmly on the road.  And here we have the epitome of a driver who is carelessly distracting himself from the road and safety.
SpongeBob, I mean, a boater without boat smarts shows contempt for his boater brethren and the law.
Never mind.
Oh, there you are.
And here's the last one. Now, just give a nice smile to the camera, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob, please stop crying so he can take the picture.
Remember, class, there's only one way to park a boat: the safe way. You now see the importance of proper steering and a properly calibrated anchor...  ...which brings us to the subject of rudder maintenance.
Wait a minute, class!  Remember, we will not be here tomorrow. We will be going on a field trip to the Boating Museum. Now run along, kids.
Neptune, give me strength!
Nothing, uhh, just keep driving.  Step on it!
Phew.
SpongeBob, you look terrible.
Yes, SpongeBob?
Made what?
Thank you, SpongeBob.
Yes, SpongeBob?
Well, that would be...
Wasn't that the...
Welcome, class, to the Boating Museum. This enormous vessel was once the largest in all the seas, but now that has been converted into a museum, it no longer moves.
If you don't mind, SpongeBob, I'll be doing the teaching today.
Here it is, class. The most extensive collection of seafaring history ever assembled, from giant naval vessels to more modest craft like this clamming boat.
Uh, sure, SpongeBob.
Moving along.  Over here we have the Sandy Nub. It was a cargo ship used to bring back exotic spices from faraway lands.
Thank you again, SpongeBob.
This, class, is the Lady Scallion.
Oh, you're going to get it all right.
Okay, this is the end of the tour. Anything to add, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?
That's not a projection screen!  SpongeBob, stop it right now!
Good morning class. Would everyone please take a seat?
But there's one right next to SpongeBob.
Quiet in the front please.
Okay class, how about we get to know our new students, by telling each other why we were sentenced to I mean why we are enrolled in boating school.
Very good. Next.
No, I didn't mean very.
Next.
We all know why you're here, SpongeBob. What about you, sir?
Yes. Would you like to tell the rest of the class, why you're with us today?
Your's too? Uhh. What I meant to say was, please come up to the chalkboard, and draw a diagram of the incident.
Why, certainly. And perhaps now, SpongeBob would like to come up, and illustrate his side of the story.
Okay class, it's time for our behind the wheel lesson. Squidward, you'll be riding with SpongeBob.
Now, we're going to take this nice and slow. SpongeBob, what do we do when pulling away from the curb?
Good. Nice and easy. Now let's slowly...
Okay class, it's time to take our final exam. Please have your pencils ready.
3 more minutes class.
2 more minutes.
1 more minute, class.
Okay class, times up.
You do the same thing that everybody else does who failed the test, you take it again next week.
: I can't believe such a little news story could have ruined my business!
: And I've had to go back to watching...  daytime television!
Can anyone tell me what the hand signal is for a left turn?  Something the matter, SpongeBob?
I'd say so.  Here.
And make sure you return that bathroom key to my desk, or you're in big trouble mister.
And hurry back. No dilly-dallying.
Make sure you return that bathroom key to my desk or you're in big trouble mister.
I haven't the foggiest idea what you're going on about, SpongeBob, but I don't have time for it. I've got my own problems.  Johnny Law finally caught up to me for ditching jury duty. Let this be a lesson to you, SpongeBob...never ditch.
That's a good boy, SpongeBob. Never di... Again?! What do you mean, again?
Yes? Oh, it's you, SpongeBob. What are you, uh, doing here? And not that the teacher's most enthusiastic student isn't welcome in her house.
It almost was.
A what?
I hate Mondays.
Must protect garden.  Only thing that makes life worth living.
Who's there? I'm warning you. I have a blunt instrument here, and I'm not afraid to use it.  There you are, sucker!
There, there, my darling, the bad man is gone now. And if he comes back, we'll make sure he never walks again.
I said he went that way.
No.
Happy Halloween, ScaredyPants.
Have a good summer vacation, I'll see you all next Fall!  Well... Hopefully not all of you.
Time to vamoose!
Where are my keys!?
Come on!
I gotta get out of here!  Phew! I lost him.
WHY CAN'T YOU TAKE A HINT?!
OH DEAR, OF COURSE I'LL HELP.
I WON'T READ THI-  Oh no! Not again! If my parole officer finds out, I don't stand a chance! I'll be sentenced for life this time!
Please, don't tell the police, I'll be dead man if I get caught! I'll do anything!
Oh, gracious meat, I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF CASH!
Huh? You mean we should go out on a date?
Thats right.
Yeah.
OH, I GOT YOUR NOTE ALRIGHT.
WHAT DID I THINK!? I THINK IT CAUSED ME TO- Lets just say, it changed my life.
Patience is a virtue.
Why don't we just start with my basic duties?
There are many like it but this one is mine.
I KNOW, SpongeBob. I TAUGHT YOU THAT PHRASE!
Forceful but not too forceful.
Fine...
Heh, funny costume SpongeBob.
Of course Mr. Fydmuffin. What would you like to eat today?
You mean to refer to  as Duke
Okay,  what will you have?
All right, one beans on toast coming up!
THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS! WOULD YOU SIMPLY EXPLAIN MY DUTIES
Oh dear.. Message received, Mr. Krabs.
Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I take your order?
$1 please. Thank you.
ONE KRABBY PATTY!
What?
FINE! HERE'S YOUR WRITTEN FORM!
What now?
I'LL GIVE YOUR BARR-
THAT'S IT! I DON'T CARE ANYMORE! THIS ISN'T WORTH IT!  I WILL NOT BE HUMILIATED ANY LONGER!
YOU! IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU I GOT STUCK IN THIS MESS!
I. You did?
Littered? Your absolutely right officer! Yes! I sure did litter! That's what I did!
No problem officer, time by myself in the stoney lonesome is just what I need!
1 day down, 2,528 to go! That's just shy of 4 years without SpongeBob! I'm going to enjoy this!
Oh Wow! A Driver's Education class! This is just how I made a living except without HIM. Delightful!
I MUST BE HAVING A NIGHTMARE! WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?!
Where could that awful noise be coming from? It's been going on for hours now. SpongeBob?
What are you doing? My class can hardly hear me teach.
Why would he be doing that?
Me? Why no I I couldn't
Yes
SpongeBob, that warm welcome wasn't for you.
No!
Ahem! While Tony Jr. is a student here, he will receive NO special attention! He will be treated just like the rest of us! No exceptions! Now Tony, report to the obstacle course where I will access your abilties!
Hold it!  Not until you've signed my lunchbox!
He is good... GASP! If he's really that good, maybe there's a chance, just a chance, some of that good could rub off my incorrigible student SpongeBob SquarePants!  YES!
Yes SpongeBob?
That's it.
That went better than expected! Oh! If Tony Jr. can keep this up, then SpongeBob might even graduate and I'll be rid of him forever! Forever!  FOREVER!
Well class, I regret to inform you that Tony Jr. is no longer with us...
He was transferred to another school. However, I would think that Tony Jr. taught us all a valuable lesson...
Close...the lesson is: Never let YOU drive!
Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!
Thank you, Billy. That was an excellent report. Next we have--  --SpongeBob SquarePants. Ugh.
Well, SpongeBob? Do you have your oral report ready?
The assignment I gave you. The one where you talk in front of the class.
What are you DOING?!
No. Only if you want to pass this class!
What's all this laughing about?  Well, SpongeBob?
You can't take my boat! SpongeBob!
Get back here with my boat!
Aha! Finally! The long arm of the laws caught up with you! I guess I won't be seeing you in my driver's education class for the next 5 to 10 years! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Yes. Why?
What?! Nooo!
We have
"A quiet evening studying the rules of the road!?"  Oh! ehem... That sounds too good to be true.
No, SpongeBob, not again.  Oh no! We're airborne!
No, SpongeBob! Don't touch that! Oh, dear!
Oh my. What happened to me?Source
Oh no! Will I ever be my old self again?
Gasp!
This is all your fault!
Why can't you just graduate out of my life?! Oh. Ohh.
Yes. I'm alligeric to them and you!
Ouch.
I'm not leaving this bed! Woah!
Risking their lives for our amusement? I could finally be rid of SpongeBob! Forever! Ha ha! And I mean that in the worst possible way!
I just thought of a way that you could earn extra credit!
Yes, hooray indeed!
So what do you say Captain Lutefisk? Will you enter him in the derby? For old times sake?
Looks can be deceiving! Observe! Here SpongeBob Hold this.
Heh heh, yes! "Extra credit!"
I can't look! Wait, yes I can!
What? This is not going well...
What is wrong with you guys?! Squash the Squish! Yes!
Why... are you still... ?!
Curse you, SpongeBob!
This is it! Ha ha! Yes! Huh?
If you want someone demolished, I guess you have to demolish them yourself! Not so fast! There's one more challenger! I'm The Huff! You're blocking my view! Hah hah hah! Huh?
Yes, perfectly normal.
No! Stay away! I can't afford to go back in the slammer!
Why would I care about that?
Not particularly.
Yes, that's me.
NOOO!!
Phew...changing the oil in the school busmobile sure is a pain in the......What?  STOP! THEIF!
Huh? (Patrick-Man throws a net around Mrs. Puff.)
Boat thief?! Heavens no! My poor student is trapped inside this boat! The doors are jammed!
Ah, merciful Neptune! The authorities are here. You'll be outta there in no time.
But, I didn't do anything!
Felony?! Oh, ugh. Patrick-Man...
Oh, nothing brings me more joy than teaching. I can't wait to pass my next student.
Just start driving.  Turn this boat around immediately!
All right, class. Please say hello to our newest classmate...Mr. Krabs!
Lock your doors, barr your windows, it's the end of the world!
I don't know what that was all about, but I'm glad it's over.
Yes, Eugene?
Oh!  Oh, Eugene! I thought you'd never ask.
Oh, Eugene!
Look out! Oh!
Calm down, SpongeBob!
No blowing bubbles while driving!
Phew!
Get out! You're never getting a boating license!
Never! Never!
Greetings, class. My name is
Mrs. Puff. Oh, now that everyone's driving bubbles, they don't need licenses.  I guess there's just no place in this world for an old driving instructor.
Oh! Bah!
Ah!
Ohwah!
You ran my plates and saw my rap sheet?
But I've never driven a bubble!
Bubble boating school?
Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob.  Please don't be SpongeBob.
Of course.
Great.
Oh! Ooh! Oh!
Oh! Fire!
Oh! Ah! Hmm. Hah. Eeh.
I did it.
Really?
Oh.
You know, this whole bubble boating thing isn't so bad.  Maybe I could
Eeh! Oh!
Ah!
Oh!
Oh!
No more bubbles. Get them off me!
Oh, joy.
Thanks for watering my flowers, boys.
SpongeBob!  Oh SpongeBob, why?!
We paid $9 for this?
Well, someone had to do it.
Oh, nothing SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian.  Minus 20 more points.
Negative 224.
The test is over.
No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me!
6.
Six.
Hundred.
600. You need 600 to pass. You got 6.
Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out: a teacher's ace in the hole!  Extra crediiiiit!
Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit!  I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.
It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.
Now, are we ready for that extra credit?
That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a 10-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.
Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started.  "What I learned in boating school is" There! That's already 7 words! Only 3 more!
What's wrong?
Give me that! Here's a pen.
Fantastic, let me see it.
I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see.
It's so simple, only 10 words! "What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity,  Blank!"
"What I learned in boating school is!" "What I learned in boating school is!"
You only need 3 more words!  OK, let me see what you've written.
It's OK, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written.
Give it to me!
Let me see it!  "What I learned in boating school is" Uh  Well, the rest doesn't matter!  You pass!  You pass!
That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.
Besides, here's your license.
Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!
That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive.  Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.
Well, I...Okay.
See what?
What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name! No. Not again. I've got to end this before it begins.
I hope I still remember how to do this.  Oh yeah
No, you don't! You don't know who I am!
Sorry SpongeBob, but it was for your own good.
Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes.
Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.
I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.
What's that?
And be forever adored by thousands of people you don't know.
Hit the brakes, SpongeBob! Watch that tree! Left! Left!
Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't expect to see you here.
Well, I'm not...
Uh, hello.
Hmm, perhaps another time would be...
Mr. Krabs?
I don't understand.
Goodness!
Well!
Is that true, Mr. Krabs? Do you want to take me on a date?
What do I say?  I say, you have a way with words, Mr. Krabs.
Oh, Mr. Krabs, this dinner has been so wonderful. The coral was cooked to perfection. I don't think I could eat another bite.
You're spoiling me, Mr. Krabs. I mean, foot rubs between courses...  Caricatures...  Imported music...
Uh, what I'm trying to tell you, Mr. Krabs, is...
Well...
Who is it?
Just a minute!
Almost ready!
That's funny, I thought I heard SpongeBob's voice.
Oh, e-excuse me. I have to call my insurance agent.
Here I come!
Oh, flowers! Oh, how thoughtful!
Oh, Eugene!
Actually, a walk in the park sounds perfect. It's a beautiful day. I'll just need to get a sun hat and...
Oh, well thank you. But you didn't need to buy one. I have a hat in the closet.
Are we going to the park soon?
I didn't know SpongeBob had such a colorful vocabulary. Actually, there's something I'd like to say too, Mr. Krabs.  I'm afraid I just don't feel comfortable accepting all these gifts. I'd rather go Dutch, if you don't mind.
You're a very sweet man, Mr. Krabs.
Ok, class, quiet, quiet. Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment.
Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight.
In no less than 800 words.
Due tomorrow. And remember class: work hard and no goofing off.
Oh, there you are SpongeBob.
I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you.. I have to go to a teacher's convention!
I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!
Good morning class. Sorry I'm late. I got caught in traffic on the way in here when that whole 'I'm-going-to-be-doing-this-for-the-rest-of-my-life' thing reared its ugly head and I...  Anyway, we have a new student starting today, so let's all put on a happy face for Flats the flounder.  Tell the class something about yourself, Flats.
What a card! Now Flats, it's time to pick your seat. Just go ahead and sit anywhere you'd like.  Okay class, as you remember last week...
Yes, SpongeBob?
Why no, SpongeBob. I'm in the middle of a coffee-fueled sermon right now. You can't afford to miss this information.
Now, can I please have a volunteer to come up to the board? How about you, Flats?  Please draw for us a diagram of a basic four-way intersection, Flats.  Please turn and show the class what you drew, honey.  My, how very creative! We have an artist in the class.
Come in, SpongeBob.
But why?
Why ever not?
SpongeBob, you can tell me anything. You've got to believe that.
Of course.
What? There shall be no butt-kicking in any class of mine! This is an adult program. SpongeBob, just leave it to me.
Have a nice lunch, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob, I talked to Flats for you. I used your name. It was all a big misunderstanding.
He was never going to kick your butt at all! You see SpongeBob, Flats is from a town where kicking someone's butt means that he wants to be your friend.  And maybe play some sports with you on weekends.
Sorry I'm late, class, I...  SpongeBob! I can't believe you beat up a new student!  I'm going to kick your butt!
Hello, SpongeBob.
I'm not ready.
We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must...
I know. Okay, #1: What is the front of the boat?
What is the back?
#3: Right is...
You've passed the oral test. What a surprise!  Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat.
Get in the boat, SpongeBob.
All you have to do is get on the track.  Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do?
No, no. First thing is to start the boat.  SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat.
Okay, now what do you do next?
Yes... no, no! Don't floor it.
No, no, don't, don't floor it.
No! No!  Oh, SpongeBob, why?
Let's get this over with.  What's the first thing you do?
Whoa-ho! Huh? What?
The boat? You started the boat?
Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do?
Yes, yes, yes!  Put it in drive. Then what?
No!
Oh gracious. Oh gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven't crashed yet.
Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn.
Oh!
Oh! Oh my, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You're doing fine.
Splendid! Wonderful!  There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head?  Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna?  And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers?  Oh, yes, but that would be cheating.
Yes, my star pupil?
What's that, dear?
You've... you've let go of the wheel.
The wheel, SpongeBob! The wheel...
No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat!
At least, SpongeBob...
Cheat that way!
It's okay to cheat today!
That way! Cheat that way!
Oh, SpongeBob, why?
It's okay, SpongeBob, you didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away.
The driving test is over, SpongeBob. Stop the boat!
The road, SpongeBob, get back on the road!
Look out!
Look out!
Where did I go wrong?!  With the opening of my new boating school, I pledge that as long as a student is willing to learn, I shall never give up.
Alive! I'm alive! Oh, thank Neptune, I'm still...
Ow. SpongeBob, are you okay?
Hold it, you can't arrest him! He's just a student driver!
But I don't belong here! It's all a big mistake!
Okay, you can do this, Puff. You can get through this without losing your sanity. Oh, that's a road we don't want to go down again. Positives. Think of the positives. Let's see...I've got no more papers to grade. Yeah!  In fact, no more work. No more boating school classes. No more driving, no more SpongeBob... ...no more phone solicitors, no more SpongeBob, no more company potlucks, no more SpongeBob...  ...no more road rage, no more SpongeBob, no more insurance payments, no more SpongeBob, no more SpongeBob,  no more SpongeBob,  no more SpongeBob!  I think I'm gonna like this place.
Smelling the pretty roses.... haaapiness is just two kinds of ice creeeeam!
That's funny. For a second, I thought that yellow rock talked to me. And its voice sounded a lot like...
It's you. What are you doing here? Why did you follow me in here? Why?!
Yes, it must be the heat. Yes.
Hi, Donna. It's chili, same as always. Let me get you some.
When are these horrific hallucinations going to end?
Why?
No, I mean, why'd you bring him?
SpongeBob, I am not going with you.
He's right, SpongeBob. I'm staying.
I like it here. These are my people!  And besides, if I'm in here, that means I won't have to deal with yooou...  ...uranium in the water supply.  See? Crystal clear!  Aahhhh!
For the last time, no!  I'm not going with you and that's final!  Oh.
Guards! Guards, come quick.  There's a crazed ex-student of mine and his overweight friend here to break me out!
Guards! Guards, come look!
Guards, guards! They're back!
They're back!
Get away from me! Get away!
You can't fool me! You're SpongeBob and that guy who likes the chili.
Oh well. Let's look at the positives again. I'm finally away from those two. Yes. All alone in my nice, soft room.
No! What?
I can't believe it. It was all a dream. I'm not going to jail!
Oh, it's just my imagination again.
Huh? What? Huh? Ah, forget it.
