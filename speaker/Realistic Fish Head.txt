We interrupt your bleak and meaningless lives for this news report.  Man Ray,  the Dirty Bubble, and now, playing for the dark side, Barnacle Boy...
...have been committing a series of crimes throughout Bikini Bottom.
These three have named their new alliance: Every Villain Is Lemons, otherwise known as E.V.I.L.! What can we do? When will this crime wave end? How will we defeat the evil? Why am I asking  all these questions? Mermaid Man, where are you?
Hey kids, are you ready to hear the winner of this week contest?
Our winner will receive a special secret collector's item from The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.  And the winner is... [SpongeBob chatters his teeth] SpringBoob SquirePin.
... for these Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
What's that? Oh. It appears I've made a slight error in pronunciation. The real name of the winner is... SpongeBob SquarePants!
Attention, attention! This just in!  A giant monster is attacking Bikini Bottom.
