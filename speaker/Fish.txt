Sure. I don't know. Why not?
Oh, O.K. Sure.
Mind if I test it out?  Yeah, this does feel comfortable.
The power within. The power within.
Welcome to my island, SpongeBob-san.
Jeepers, what's with all the lunatics?
Come here, little buddy.  He's just adorable.  Mad snail disease is real! I'm a zombie. I've been bitten by a mad snail. I've got mad snail disease!
Hey!  Hey, you there!
Yes, you.  Get outta town!  Get outta town! And take a vacation to beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort.  Here ya go, sir.
Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test.
Uhh, no.
You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.
Women will want you.  Men will want to be you.  You'll be the envy of your friends.
I finally did it! At long last, I've acquired issue #2 of Wonder Space Fish, and in mint condition. Now my 40 year-old life and my comic book collection are complete. Mom's gonna be so proud of me.
But, I've spent my entire life collecting those.
I will cry about it.  Cry right to my mom!
The Wild Ones?! Tar nation! Don't you know who the Wild Ones are, son?!
Why, they're the most ferocious, bloodthirsty biker gang under the sea. They've destroyed entire cities in an afternoon!
Huh?
Who are you? Where did you come from?
Oh, thank Neptune. Hey, guys, I found a way out. Come on!  I'm free! I'm free! I'm sugar-free!  At last!
My ears!
Clear!
40 years I've been here. There's ain't no way out of this valley. You're stuck in here' with me for the rest of your lives!
Hey, watch where your stepping!
I know what you was doing. You was doing the old "bump into the sucker and reach into his pockets and take his change" routine, but it ain't gonna work this time. You want money? Get a job, you deadbeat!
Real drag, isn't it? Having to stand around the fire for warmth every night?
You can't do that here!!
What the?!
She's not lying.  She speaks the truth. Someone wicked has disturbed our peaceful city, Frank.
Squidward! Squidward Tentacles! He lives on Conch Drive!
Yes, we must capture him. He must pay for his wrong doings!
Oh, no tears son, we'll get in next year.
Ow...
Who me?
Oh, boy. Signed by Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Now I shall be the envy of the Superhero Fan Club! Ohhh...
Aaahhhhhhhhh!
What has happened to the theater?
Get in the car, kids!
No! It means-
Um, I'd like a Double Krabby meal with extra kelp...
Yay-hey!
He's headed straight for the Barg'N-Mart!
His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
Yes! We do!
He's insane! Run for your lives!
One Krabby Patty, please.
I am Agent Twirp of the Bogus  Business Bureau.  Are you the proprietor of this...  establishment?
But I'm wearing sandals!
You call that a castle?  This is a castle.
Duh. Here, let me help you do some remodeling.  What are you smiling about?
You spilled my juice!
Man, these patties sure are delicious. I wonder what's in that secret formula.
Everyone at the head enhancement clinic said nobody would notice.
Mm-hmm.  And now, with the addition of two, count 'em, two marshmallows.
No, I am. I got sand in my buns.
It's love!! The secret ingredient is love!!
Well, what do we have here?
So you won't talk, huh? Let some air out of it.
Ow!
That's true.
Hurry up with that truckload of fruit punch! The seniors are getting cranky!
Hey, there's a couple.
Yeah, I'll give you a buck-50 for this umbrella.
Ten bucks?  It's full of holes!
A queen you say? That's-- Wait a second... they don't have a queen!
Deal!
Squidward Tentacles?
