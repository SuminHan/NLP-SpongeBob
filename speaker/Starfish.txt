Good day, sir. I am...
Salutations, young one. Say, you wouldn't happen to know that starfish that lives under this rock, would you?
Well, it's too bad you don't know Patrick Star, because I am from the Royal Ministry, and have a gift for him.
That's because you're suppose to wear it, not eat it. Allow me to show you something.  Let's see here. Aha! What I hold in my hands is a family tree that goes back centuries. It starts with the marriage of King Amoeba and Queen Mildew. Then, through a few inbred generations, ends at you, Sir Patrick, which makes you a descendant of royalty. You are a king. And now it's time I adjourn to the Royal Ministry, where I should be at your service. Your Highness.
Oh, I think I know what's going on here. Patrick, with great power comes great responsibility.  You haven't a clue what I just told you, do you?
Oh, just as well. I've come to take the crown back, as it seems that you aren't royalty after all.
I've discovered this coffee stain, which upon removal, reveals that Sir Gary is the true heir to the king's crown.
