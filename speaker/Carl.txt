Hi, gentlemen, I'm Carl. I'll be your new manager.
I think you'll find working at the Krabby O' Mondays to be a both learning experience and enjoyable one.
You won't be needing these anymore.  Now here are your new uniforms and here are the...  new manuals. See ya first thing tomorrow.
Uhh, Squidward, can I talk to you for a second? What's our motto here at Krabby O' Mondays?
Well, yes, but with the Krabby O' Mondays spirit. Now, Squidward, you wouldn't want to have to talk to human resources...  ...would you? So, what's our motto again?
Now you're gettin' it.
Hey, fellas, what's going on over here?
Cut the chatter, and pick up the platter! Great job, Squidward.
The less you know, Eugene, the better.
Look around you. our customers are quite content with the contrived and the mediocre.
Eugene, you're in violation of your contract.
Mr. Blandy? Code red! Free thinker!
Oh, my.  Does this mean I won't get that raise, sir?
Say, Andy, you gotta try these patties. They're delicious.
You're not the boss of me.
It's perfect!
Ow.
Woaaw! Man, I'm glad I'm not in that thing.
