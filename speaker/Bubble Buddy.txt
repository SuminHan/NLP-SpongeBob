The Mrs. and I have to go away for a few days, and our regular bubble sitter is sick. Could you please watch our son, Shiny, until we get back? I owe you one! Your pal, Bubble Buddy.
Hey, SpongeBob. How's my son been faring?
I see you've grown a second head, again, son.
Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'll take care of it.  So, did my son behave himself?
Well, see you later.
Whoa!  Hey, don't I get a say in this? I'll see you later, SpongeBob. Things are getting a little weird around here.
Happy Leif Ericcson Day!
