Are you ready, kids?
I can't hear you.
Oh...   Who lives in a monument under the sea?
 Obnoxious, abrasive, conceded is he. 
 If practical common sense be something you wish, 
Are you ready, kids?
I can't hear you.
Oh...   Who lives like a barnacle under the sea?
Are you ready, kids?
I can't hear you.
Oh...   Who lives in an anchor under the sea?
 Crusty and red and greedy is he.  
 If stingy and greedy is something you wish, 
Arr, I be just a painting of a head.
Are you ready, SpongeBob lovers?
Are you ready kids?
