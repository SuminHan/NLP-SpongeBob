Hey! Who blew this bubble?  You all know the rules!
That's right! So who blew it?!
So... Nobody knows?
Shut up!  Somebody in here ain't a real man.  You! We're on a baby hunt. And don't think we don't know how to weed them out. Now, everybody line up! DJ! Time for the test.  No baby can resist singing along to this.
It was you! You're the baby!
DJ! Turn it up louder!
I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah! You're a Goofy Goober, yeah! We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah!
Well, well, well. Which one of you babies was it?
Well, looks like we got ourselves a double baby!
