Gee, SpongeBob really knows how to throw a great party!
Open up, it's time for the pill!
Well, of course I do! But that's okay. Daddies are supposed to be old.
See, no one says cool anymore. That's such an old-person thing. Now we say "coral," as in, "That nose job is so coral."
Eww, when you say it, it sounds so uncoral.
Don't you have to go to work or something, Dad?
Jenny? It's Pearl. "Coral" is definitely out.
Stop it, just stop it! You're embarrassing me, Dad! [sobbing]
Did you see the shoes she has on? So last year.  Hold on, Gina. Yeah, Dad?
Fine.
I'm talking on the phone!
Really.
Dad, isn't there something you need to do?
Get out! That's it, Dad. Get a job, get a hobby, or get some friends. Because I can't take it anymore!
Father, what art thou going on about now?
Father, remember your blood pressure. You wouldn't want another leech treatment, would you?
Father, you must spare them. Hast thou forgotten about the prophecy.
The one right above your head.
The story tells of two brave knights who fall from the sky, and are sent by the king to rid the lamenting town of the evil dragon controlled by the one-eyed wizard. Father, don't you get it? It's them. These strangers have come to rescue us, like in the prophecy.
Daddy, help!
The prophecy is nigh!
I be-eth ok.
I'm gonna be a movie star.
Oh, daddy, you said I was going to be a star!
Yeah!
Yeah! It's all about me On my 16th birthday I want music, clothes, and shiny things So give it up right away Everybody in the whole wide world They have to pay attention to me It's all about me, me...and guess who? Me!  Oops!
Morning, daddy!
Oh, daddy. I'm just excited because tomorrow's a very special day.
You have no idea what day tomorrow is, do you?
IT'S MY 16TH BIRTHDAY!
I'm going to be 16! It's only the most important birthday in my entire life. If I don't have a completely awesome party, my whole high school reputation will collapse. I'll have to drop out, I won't go off to college, I'll never leave home. You'll have to support me for the rest of my life.
Then promise me you'll give me a real party this year. And don't be cheap!  Hi, girls.
Are you guys coming to my totally coral birthday party tomorrow?
Daddy!
Tell me you've got something totally coral planned for my birthday party.
Daddy, you ruined all my birthday parties. But you better not ruin this one. Now promise me you won't be cheap.
Good, because I made a list.  Now I want everything on this list at my party.  Bye. I'll be at the mall with my friends.
So, that's when Marcy told me that Julie said that Angela did like Brad.
Oh my gosh, this is the greatest thing I have seen in the whole world.
Wow, this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in the whole world. Glitter gloss!
Coming, Judy.
This is the greatest thing in the whole world!
This sea pony is the cutest thing ever. Do you want to come home and be my pony?  Whee!
Oh my gosh, it's Billy Fishkins.
Wouldn't it be cool if my dad got me this for my birthday?
Yeah, he probably got me another box of staples.
Daddy!
Is that supposed to be me?  It's made out of Krabby Patties! Gross.
Well, the cake does look good.  It's made out of cardboard?!
Wait, don't leave. My dad got Boys Who Cry to play. You did get Boys Who Cry, right?
Daddy, how could you? I gave you a list.
You ruined everything! You couldn't stop being cheap, even for me.
You bought me a boat?
Oh, daddy, I don't know how it could get better than this.
Oh, daddy, you got me everything I wanted.
What are you talking about, Dad?
Once you taste the secret goodness of a KelpShake...  You can't have just one.
Buy your own.
I feel sorry for you.
Dad, you're embarrassing me.  Oh, get away.
Thanks for the show, Dad. Now can we open the presents?
Oh you shouldn't have. What is it, Daddy? It wouldn't be those totally hip new flipper slippers all my friends are using, would it? Everyone wants them.
Whee!  Oh, you shouldn't have, yay, you shouldn't have.  I mean, Dad,  you really shouldn't have!
Dad, you ruined me!
Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!
Daddy, the house is full of burglars.
Give me a K-R-U!  Give me a S-T-Y!  Krusty Krab!  Krusty Krab!  Krusty Krab!
Thank you! Thank you, thank you!
Unacceptable!
My friends will be here in 20 minutes for my slumber party and you're laying around in your tighty-no-longer-whities.
If you trusted me you would leave for the night.
Dad!
You promise?
Good night, daddy.
Dad!
Crackers and tap water? You are the cheapest crab alive!
Well, yeah. Yeah, we would.
Ketchup?!
Oh! They're here!  Hi! Dad?
No dancing, no loud music after 7: 30, no touching the root beer cellar?!
Youre not coming back in this house until after my slumber party is over!
What are you gonna do about it? Take away my allowance?  Here you go!
Hello?
Do I know you?
Uh-huh.
I know its you, SpongeBob SquarePants!
You were sent to spy on me by my dad! Get him, girls!
We didnt order any pizza!
Id sooner believe space aliens sent me a free pizza before Id believe my dad would! Now, who are you?
SpongeBob?!
Get him!
Oh, big surprise. Dad was too cheap to buy real pizza!
Who is it?
Okay! Well be right out!
Have it back by tomorrow, OK?
Whoever could it be this time?
Hold the boiling oil!  What do you want, SpongeBob?
No!
I can give you a hundred million billion reasons!
Reason number one: youre just like my dad!
A no-good, dried-up, old fuddy-duddy!
Sure, SpongeBob. If you can prove youre the most fun person on the planet in the next ten seconds, you can stay.
Five seconds.
Two seconds!  OK, OK, I got to admit. That was kinda fun.
Hes not hurt.  See?
This movie isnt all that scary!
Trusted me? Your employee destroyed this house!  The only boy at the party!
Its your fault my party is ruined, and now all my friends have zombie shock syndrome!
We were fine with a nice simple slumber party. But now, its gonna cost you!
Money...
Everyone having a good time?  Well, you can all thank my dad for making this possible! Thank you, daddy!
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!
Dad!
Open up!
Dad! Dad!
Daddy!
What's with the lame outfit?
That's because there's only one fish in the sea that's long, tan and handsome as he is. And that's him!
Ahh, the fry cook? Do you know what that would do to my complexion? People would mistake me for a planetarium?
I don't know. But I can't take him, daddy! They'll kick me off the most frequently pictured in the yearbook committee.
Just don't be late, SpongeBob.
Well, at last no one will recognize you. Now listen, SpongeBob, I just want to get through this with my social status intact.  I want to go to the prom, get my picture taken, and I want to dance...  ...I want to drink punch with my friends and don't do that other thing you're always doing...
A limo! Why didn't you say so?  I love limousines!
Yay! My first prom picture!
Let's get this over with.  Come on, SpongeBob!
Will you hurry up?
SpongeBob, here come my friends. Uhh, go get me some punch!
Hi girls.
Hi Brian.
He's over at the punch bowl getting me some punch.
Oh yes!  I mean... Oh no.  Oh, quick, let's go see how ugly Cindy's dress is!  SpongeBob, what are you doing?
You look ridiculous.
Stay down, he'll see us! It's my ex-boyfriend, Octavius Rex, a.k.a. long, tan and handsome.
SpongeBob, what are you doing? Can't you see everybody here is doing 'the whack'?
Are you sure you can do this?
Well, I guess you can take me home now, now that you've ruined everything!
Sponge, are you okay?
Don't worry SpongeBob, ya didn't mess everything up.
Actually, it was pretty funny when that hot dog landed in Judy's hair.
But I am having a good time! Ya know, we haven't finished our dance yet.
Yes, you can still wear the wig.
Get lost, pizza topping! Can't you see I'm doing the Sponge?
Oh, don't worry SpongeBob, I knew it would be a total disaster all along. But as long as disasters go, that was really fun.
Oh, Daddy! Well goodnight, short, yellow and spongy. SpongeBob?
Daddy! I'm borrowing your wallet!  Line dancing? Eww! That is so lame. What they need is my way cool cheer routine.  Give me a K!
Go, team, go! Go, team, go! Go, team, go!
Fight, team, fight! Fight, team, fight! Fight, team, fight!
Daddy!
What's happening to me?!
So did I.
It means I need food!!
Daddy!
Well, you're just gonna have to go buy some.
Wait, what's that green stuff in your pocket?
There!
I'll just have to eat this.
More Daddy, More!
More!
Oh, Oh! So hungry, not gonna make it!
Daddy, I'm not hungry anymore, and I've stopped growing. I feel great. Heh, Heh!
Oh, dad, you're embarrassing me again!
Daddy!
Did he just go into the freezer?
I prefer salad over Plankton anyway.
Mall money.
Double my mall money!
Hey, this isn't money!
No way! The Chum Bucket is, like, totally gross!
Oh nothing, SpongeBob. Just trying to juggle schoolwork, having a social life, and running a family business. That's all.
I don't know. When I went to get my allowance this morning, he was gone.
Daddy!
Get me out of this trash heap!
Enough with the hugging!
Should we help?
Daddy! Daddy!
Can I go to the mall now?
I wanna go to the mall!
Wait what? You seriously don't know what a mall is?
Well, the mall is only like the most awesome place to get the best, super-coolish, glittershly fabulous new stuff you want!
You ready for the mall, girls?
No?!
Barnacles, SpongeBob why are you talking to me?
Quiet! He is not my boyfriend!
Ugh, I will put my arm in the boat. But don't touch me, don't talk to me, don't even look at me!
BORING!
Ugh, this ride is lame! Hey! You're allowed to speak now!
You are making this ride even more boring! Is such a thing is possible!
What was that?!
Oh great! Just great!
That wasn't me, that was SpongeBob!
Well, whatever SpongeBob, I'm gonna find my way out!
Fine. After you.
Those are streamers!
Oh, grow up, SpongeBob!  There aren't any creepies, there aren't any crawlies, and there aren't any snakes! So stop whining so we can look for a way out of here!!!
SpongeBob!
SpongeBob!
SpongeBob.
Okay SpongeBob. Okay.
That's enough, SpongeBob!
Now I'm scared, SpongeBob!
But there's no such thing!
I don't know. Hold me SpongeBob
Pssssst. I imagined it bigger.
I guess that turned out to be pretty fun.
How many times to I have to say it. Eww! Gross!
You understand girls. For posterity!
I am sure in a jovial mood! How about you guys?
Hey you guys. It sounds like that weird guy Squidward. What do you say we play a prank on him?
Hello, SpongeBob!
You're just in time for the tea party!
Oh. He's next door.  Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
You bet your bottom dollar!
It's just an expression daddy. I just mean I'm really excited!  Gasp!
Daddy! One of your employees is in the back seat!
Daddy! I thought this was supposed to be OUR family vacation!?
You know, SpongeBob. We got an old family tradition of having our guests ride on the floor with the luggage until we leave town!
Just the sound of this vacation dying!
Sure, why not? Join the funeral. SUPER MEGA MALL WORLD? Is that where we going?
Holly molly! We're going to Planet Rollercoaster!  But, daddy? W-why aren't we stopping?
Yeah! He's a real chuckle factory
Teenage Boy Museum! Teenage Boy Museum!
YAY! The Teenage Boy Museum!  It was right there!
Gasp!
There is NO way I'm going in there! I rather sit in through the rubble of the Teenage Boy Museum!
Huh? Ah! An autograph-  NOOO!
And I haven't charged YOU yet for taking me on this terrible vacation!  Here's the two dollars I was short on those shoes. I must've maxed out daddy's credit card!  Yay! Shoes!
Boy, do I love high school. . You know what? Someday we're gonna remember all this, and we're gonna look back and say... Remember?
Of course I didn't forget. I'm so excited.
What!?
Where!?
Oh, Daddy! It's terrible. The school dance is this weekend.
No, daddy! Don't you understand?! The terrible part is that I can't go to the dance!
Because I have a hideous barnacle growing on the !
We have to get rid of it, no matter what it takes!
Oh, okay. I need an appointment with a dermatologist, a trip to the spa, expensive creams and lotions, and probably some other kind of...
I don't know, SpongeBob. The school dance is right around the corner, and this barnacle seems to be getting bigger by the minute!
Are you sure?
How?
You took Patrick to a hypnotist?
I thought you said it was a barnacle.
Pelican.
Are you really going to use hypnosis to get rid of the... barnacle?
Is everything okay?
Did it come off?
SpongeBob, how much longer?
Good idea. I'm going to scrub my face with some soap and water.
There's more!
All I did was wash with soap and water!
Yes, but why?
No.
I'm not going to the dance!
And what exactly would that do to me?
How?
In the basement. Duh, where else?
I've been using soap made out of KRABBY PATTIES?!
That's
DADDYYYYY!
I'm never gonna be able to get these barnacles off! My young life is ruined forever.
The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle, my--
Okay. The Bikini Bottom High School Dance was supposed to be my chance to sparkle.
Are you done yet?
I don't know, SpongeBob -- what would my friends say?
Are you sure?
I do?
Whee! To the Bikini Bottom High School Dance!
Daddy, there's a submarine on the roof. Oh, you seem kind of busy. Maybe I should come back later.
Yeah, I guess so.
Sure, my nose is full of it.
I guess us mammals have to stick together.
Um...Dad?
No.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, my, gosh.
Oh my gosh!  Call him on my cell!
Hi, Daddy! I need money for shoes.
Thanks, Daddy!
Daddy, I want to...  Are you kissing a locket with a woman's picture in it?!!
No way!  I have seen stepmoms in movies, Dad. She'll make me sweep up the cinders, and then she won't let me go to the ball!  And then I'll  meet my Prince Charming!
Okay... then what's she like?
Blech!
It's actually a rash.
I'm not wearing shoes. Those are barnacles.
Stop trying to mom at me, lady!  I don't need youuu!
You'll  understand me!  In fact, I'm going to make it a point to never be understandable again!  Blarb snobble goober
Oh, you wouldn't get it, Dad. It's a " thing."
Ooh!
...
Hey, girl! Let's hang out!
I guess I'll see you later then.
Hey, girl! Want to come over and make fun of boys or something?
Oh! So heinous. See ya later.
Nixie! My bestest friend in the whole wide world. You should come over. We can watch TV and eat cheese!
Oh, you don't work at the mall, do you, Derek?
Daddy! Guess what?
Dad, I'm getting a job today.
I'll be a independent working woman, blazing my own trail and standing on my own two fins.
Oh, can i borrow $10?
Oh, Daddy, you'll see me after work.
Hey, Marina! I'm here to apply for a job.
Ah!
I-I don't think he's in there.
I would like to apply for a job, please.
Ah!
Oh, Nixie, I need to work at Dangles and Bangles.
This is my last chance. You gotta help me out here.
Oh, please, please, please, please, please!
You don't understand. I have to work here!
Oh, bangles.
Ah...
Oh, this is the worst.
If i don't get a job at the mall,
I'm gonna have to hang out with my dad.
Yeah! I need one as soon as possible.
It's a life or death situation, actually.
In danger of never seeing my friends 'cause I don't have a job.
Weird.
I've never been in this part of the mall before.
Ugh! What's that smell?
Oh, this is the best day of my life!
Yeah, I got a job at Grandma's Apron.
Old people aren't that bad. Are they?
Well, we are having a sale on them. They're 25% off today.
But it's not fair.
Who would even take a picture of that?
Wait, but who took that picture--
Whoa, come back here, yarn!
You guys just don't get it. Being a grandma is fun.
I get to sit in a rocking chair, dust tchotchkes, bake cookies, knite mittens, hats and scarves.
It's actually, like, the most coral store in the whole mall, so you can all just...just... eat barnacles!
Hi-ya!
Well, I don't care what you think anymore anyway. I'm being true to myself, and--and that's all that matters!
I'm a grandma now. Right, Beatrice?
I guess you're right. Being a grandma is nice and all, but i do miss being a super hip young person.
Hey, wait up, guys! I want to be friend while i'm still young!
Oh I'll miss you daddy! But I really can't wait to spend your hard earned money on shoes!
Yes, Daddy, and stop babying me!
Oh, I really hope people like it!
Oh!  "This picture looks like it was drawn by a Brine Shrimp!" Oh, Daddy!
Thanks, dad.
Ooh, look!  It's SpongeBob NudeyPants.
Hello? Daddy?
Hi guys.
Great dad, because I have so many new ideas.
It's a surprise.
Great, then close your eyes.
Ta-daaaaaaaaaaa...  It's the new Krusty Krew uniform. I designed it myself.
Oh SpongeBob, you look so adorable. I could just eat you up.
Don't feel jealous, Uncle Squiddy. I made one for you too.
Squidward is such a barnacle.
But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style.
Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me.
Why, with my girlish instincts and your um... sponginess,  we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise.
SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?
Our new name for our new look. I mean, "The Krusty Krab" has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh!
Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab?
The Kandy Krab!
Aaah! No!
Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision.
SpongeBob, order up!
Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments.
Exactly.
Come on SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!
Check out this new menu I came up with.
Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore.  I've got something more fun for you to do anyway.
Totally rude, SpongeBob.
Sure, SpongeBob.
Oh, SpongeBob!
I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working!
No, don't you get it! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh SpongeBob, what should I do?
Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!
Deal.  Oh, boy! ,
Thanks, SpongeBob.  Come on gang, the mall awaits!
It's the world-famous surf punk, Grubby Grouper!
Oh, I'll never wash this flipper again.
He washed my flipper!
No. "Go" as in...
A goofball?
This dance is so last year.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
Could I please have a um... an advance on my allowance?
One dollar? You hate me!
Okay, Daddy. I've decided I'm gonna run away! Run away and find a new daddy!
He's the saltiest of all the sea dogs.
Oh, Jen. I've got a real problem.
I've got all this money and I don't know what to do with it and I'm hungry.
Who's there?
