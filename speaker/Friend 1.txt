Hi, Pearl.
I don't know, Pearl. Is this going to be as totally coral as last year, when your dad passed out paper clips as party favors?
I can't wait to see how he ruins this year.
Oh.
It sure would be. If he was cool, which he's not.
Stale popcorn.  It tastes like dishwater.
Well, Pearl, 16 lame parties in a row. Must be a new record. Let's get out of here.
What a rip-off!!
