Well, I'm afraid it doesn't look good, Spongebob. It seems you've severely damaged your ulnar collateral ligament, possible from some kind of repeated action.
Certainly that is one possibility. Hitchhiking could be another.
Spongebob, I can't say that for certain. I'm only a board certified thumbologist. I don't know everything. I can only say that we must give it time and see. There are limits to science. But you should prepare yourself for the possibility that you may never regain the use of your thumbs again.
