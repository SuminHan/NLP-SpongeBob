I don't know, but isn't he handsome?
And a great waiter, dear.
Yeah! Bring that little fella over here and let me give him a $300 dollar tip!
These things are so cute!
Isn't he just adorable?
Oh, thank you very much, darling. And your dance moves are pretty cool, too.
That's right, kid. You got the dazzle, dazzle, dazzle. I love how you did that shuffle into the moonsault, and then stuck the landing!
Wait! I'm not finished speaking words. I'm a high-class talent agent and I want to invite you to an audition. I have a very talented client who needs a backup dancer and you got what it takes!  Come down to my dance studio tomorrow afternoon. You're goin' places, kid.
Hey SpongeBob, thanks for the bike!  Can you believe this guy? I just met him this morning!
Look, there he is.
I'm never eating here again.
