Stop!
I am the spirit guide of the salmon people! I am the Shalmon!
Why do you dump your nuts on my people's land, SpongeBob?
Allow me to give you some sage advice. You must not squander nature's bounty. Nuts are meant to be eatin'.  It's all in my book.
Of course! The earth provides our food and we must care for her in return.  It's all about balance, my friend. Look at my garden.
Over there!
The boy is right! Why do you hurt your tree? The tree would never hurt you.  Ouch! Dang splinters!
Indeed. But to feed so many from a single tree... Let me share with you a story. Long ago, before fish walked the seas, there lived in the sky one sun.
One star.
And one moon.
During the day, the star would play with the sun.
At night, the star would play with the moon.
The star did not want to let his friends down. But he alone could not keep up with both the sun and the moon.
That is when the star had an idea.
By creating many copies, the star was able to keep the sun and moon happy without wearing himself out. Do you understand why I tell you this tale?
Hello? Wake up!
Perhaps with many trees, you can continue serving your community in a natural and sustainable manner.  I mean pretty much anything is better than this mess! Yeesh!
Well, my work here is done. It's time I return to my people.
Let me offer some sage advice. You must listen to the earth and the stars, for only they can guide you!... To my stop at the corner of Olive and Victory.
Typical. It never ends!
