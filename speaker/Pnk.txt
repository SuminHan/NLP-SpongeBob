Well, there's no use sitting around like a bunch of barnacles on the bottom of a dry dock dinghy. Let's do some practicing!

 We need a lemon tree. 
 We just chillin' on the sea.   Let's get this scurvy started.   A pirate ain't worthy  til he's got scurvy. Since you got your scurvy, oh, you unnerve me when you sing that song. Scurvy! 
 We got scurvy! 
 We got scurvy! 
 We got scurvy.
