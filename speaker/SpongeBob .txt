Hi Pearl! Looks like you and I get to spend some quality time together!
It's ok sir. I'm sure I...
We can play fetch when I get home, Gary. Right now Mr. Krabs needs me. There's leftovers in the fridge if you get...
Yeah. That's exactly right, Gare-bear. I can't go to work today. The Krusty Krab is closed on Sundays. Gee, Gary, I was really looking forward to work. Now what purpose could today possibly have? Yeah, Mr. Krabs, did you me to come into work today? Oh. Hi, Sandy. Yeah... No... No, just me and Gary... No. I don't know yet... No, I'm not sick... You... need... a house-sitter?! Today?!
Uh-huh.
Well, this looks easy to remember. It's just a little black smudge.
Oh.
Wow...!
"Nor... mal." Got it.
That stands to reason.
I respect your meticulous nature.
What's next on the list?
Trust me, Sandy. You've got nothing to worry about. Your beloved treedome is in my capable hands.
Yep.
Really sure.
Normal.  2,692... 2,693... 2,694...  Sandy said this collection of rare fragile artifacts needs to be gently cleaned twice daily. There we go. Not a speck of dust anywhere. Wait a minute.  Aha! There... we go. Worm incubator. Well, looks like everything's fine here. What the...?  Ohhh!! Sandy said these wouldn't hatch for... ...weeks! What is going on?! Oh! Patrick?
Oh, what a relief. I thought you were a horrible mutant worm who was about to soak me with digestive juices and slowly consume me over a period of weeks.
Why are you wearing that funny thing on your head?
Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me. I almost for...P-P-P-Patrick! Help me! I-I can't b-b-b-breathe!
Thanks, Patrick. You're a life-saver. Now that I haven't suffocated, it's high time I got back to this list of house-sitting duties. So without further ado, Patrick, I'd like you to please immediately exit the treedome.
That's right. Exit the tree...
Well, Lucky Larry's sounds fun.
I'm trying, Squidward, but clocking out is the most upsetting part of the day!  At least soon, I'll be home where I can relive allthe wonderfulmoments from my day at work.  I'm all over it, boss man! Order up, Gare-ward!
It's just so hard to leave, even for one night!
Don't you think that working at the Chum Bucket the Krusty Krab is a conflict of interest, Squidward?
Psst! You missed a spot!
That's okay. I'll tell you.
Patrick and I are gonna see
Ahem. We'll show Squidward. We're not afraid of any old movie.
Seats taken, sir. Ooh, the movie's starting! preview  all audiences -"Fisherman 4: Attack of the Hook."
Uh, hold on, I'll take a peek
Patrick, it's okay.
Uh, sorry, sorry, sorry!
Aww, the movie's over.
Well, we'll watch it again. And this time, all the way through. Okay. Keep your eyes open.
Patrick, I'm getting scared. Hold my eyelids open.
D'ohhhh!
Must close eyes! Too scary!
Oh, no, we missed the movie.
It's okay, we'll just see the next one.
Yeah. We looked fear right in the face and... avoided direct eye contact.
Okay, buddy. Sleep tight. I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, it's just Slasher McGee. Okay, I guess I'll just go home now. It's right over there. Just a few steps that away. In the dark? All alone?
Aw, thanks, old pal. But then, who's gonna walk you home?
We're too scared.
Oh, yeah. Here. [gives Squidward's nightcap back. Squidward pulls SpongeBob's legs, which shoots him through his mail slot and into his bed]
I think so! Goodnight!
Oh, no, I will not think about the Fisherman! Sleep tight!
Not Gary. Think it'll hold?
Here.  Die in mine.
That thing's eating Squidward!
Don't worry, Squidward. We'll get you out of that old monster. Let's get to the window. (Patrick throws heavy objects onto Squidward) Okay! I think you got it! (Sirens) (Squidward grumbles) There, there, no need to digest. We're only doing what friends to for the bestest buddy. We don't have to be afraid of that old monster anymore.
:What's going on?
Maybe even a thousand!
Gee, Kenny, I sure am sorry if I ruined your career.
Welcome, Trainee! The foundation of the Krabby Patty is as follows: bun, lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce, and secret recipe patty.
But like anything in life, it's not complete without a pickle. Hey! The last one! Come on little fella. Fulfill your destiny.
Come back! Fulfill your destiny! Patrick! Stop that pickle! Weird. I didn't even know Patrick owned a pogo stick.
Not yet it isn't for you see, this patty is incomplete! Come on new guy. We gotta get that pickle for the customer! Get on! In the history of The Krusty Krab we have never served an incomplete patty and we're not gonna. Not on my watch!
Now let's see, if I'm going to catch Patrick, I must first think like Patrick. Look, Jellyfish! Try to say 'hi'. Aren't they pretty? You know, if you're gentle, you can pet them. Look it's Patrick! Hey Patrick, I need that pickle to complete the patty! Hey, that looks like the back of the  sign. ?!!! Neptune on a needle! This is gonna get a little vertical! You OK new guy? Well, at least the bubble bike made it. Hey! Let go!
Not yet. No! Don't pop the bubble bike! By the way you're doing great for your first day. Hey look, there's Patrick. He's going into the Chum Bucket!
Patrick!
Why did you steal my pickle?
Am I seeing double? What's going on here?
Plankton!
Never! You can't make me!
No!
I don't like it! I don't like it!
No! You can't have it! You can't have it! No! My baby!
Come on little fella.That's right. Complete!
Yes sir!
No pickles. Ha ha ha.
Well that was 'pickle-culiar'.
