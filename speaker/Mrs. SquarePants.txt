SpongeBob! Hi, honey, we're here!
That's great, Patrick.
Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.
Oh, hello.
Oh!
Oh, darling, it's so nice to spend quality time with you what with you in the office all hours of the day.  I got a new outfit for ya.
Help me!
Oh, but if we leave now, we'll miss the party.
Oh, why yes. We're celebrating your Cousin Blackjack's release from prison.
I told you, Harold, that was the fumigator's fault.
Oh, well here comes the man of the hour now. He's been talking all day about playing with his little cousin again. He mentioned something about jumping rope with like the old days.
Oh, my son's a star!
I think you made your point, Dear.
We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...
Don't worry, Mrs. Puff...He'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!
That's right Honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat!
SpongeBob. You need to admit your mistakes.
