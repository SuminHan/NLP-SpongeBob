: I think not. I'm Health Inspector Yellowtail. I'm officially closing down your restaurant.
:  That's not what  says.
Did somebody call a... Health inspector?
Well! I thought I recognized this horrible stench. But I thought that maybe just one of you two hadn't showered in a while.
Oh really? Well in that case you'll be happy to know I'll be ordering BOTH of your restaurants to be closed down until the two of you slime balls can clean up your act!  Good day.
I'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu.
Please, gentlemen!  Leave me to finish my work in peace.
So far, so good. I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.
Hey, hurry up with that patty!
Ah, hello, delicious. Come to papa.
Uhh, where am I?
Hey, you guys...
Yes. And at the risk of being hit again, I'd like to present you with this.
Oh boy, I'd like a Krabby Patt...
