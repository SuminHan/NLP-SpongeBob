Greetings. I am the X-29488. How may I serve you?
Attack!!!!!! Attack!!!!!
Attack!!!!! Attack!!!!!!!!
What a quaint restaurant. I think I will sample their wares.
Yes please. I'd like an order of chili coral bits.
No thank you.  Will this cover it?
Good day.
Greetings. Welcome aboard the seaship Atlantis. This is a nonstop trip, so please take a seat, relax, and we'll be on our way.
Attention passengers, regretfully we lack the fuel needed for forward motion.
We Atlanteans find the use of fossil fuels to be counter-intuitive, and have developed an alternative source we call song.
The engine of this vessel is fueled by song, the more you sing of you desires, the closer to Atlantis you will get. Let us commence singing.
Warning, you have run out of song fuel.
Ha, ha, ha!
It is ready, Ms. Cheeks.
Thank Neptune's gears. My wheels are killing me.
Oh no you don't! We're all in this together!
Oh my!
My stomach feels funny.
Coochie coochie coo.
Would you care for another diet cola with a lemon twist, weenie?
I'm sorry, sir, but my sensors indicate that you are indeed a weenie.
You can't hide what's inside.
I believe he said something about going to the wig store.
Care for another sundae, weenie?
I have a suggestion. Why not fake a fight?
I am a robot, not a miracle worker.
