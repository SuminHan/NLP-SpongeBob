Who is this 'Lisa' person?
All right, children. Today's Timmy's birthday. You know what that means. Ready Timmy?
Hey, you can't talk to my son that way! Who do you think you are?
Why hello Ray!
Say, could I borrow some of your detergent?
You haven't aged a day Ray!
Any friend of Ray's is a friend of mine.
Me too.

Hey, hey, hey, hey!
A Knucklehead McSpazatron!

We should call my nephew!
