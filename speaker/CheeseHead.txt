I wonder what got into them?
Whoo, I live in a dump!
Sorry, sir, I was just-
I'm a jobless deadbeat? What a sad existence I don't remember I live.  Ooh, seems like I'm running on empty.  Not a penny to my name. Well, I guess if I want to fill the hole in my gut, I'll need to fill a job somewhere.  Help wanted?
I can't remember a thing.
Special skills... oh, I can do this!
Okay, I guess they don't want you blowing bubbles, unless it directly relates to the job at hand.  Thanks for the job, boss! You won't be disappointed.
Then this might be music to your ears.
I do not understand this. What is wrong with this city? Maybe it's not the city. Maybe it's me.  Hey, mister, Look at me! Mister, look at me! Is there something wrong with me?
Yeah.
I guess I am just a jobless deadbeat.  You guys mind if I bubble?
But... bubbles will steady the ol' nerves. Watch.  See? Feeling better already.
What could possibly be wrong with practicing the bubble arts?  Seems like a harmless activity.
Um, wait... err, um... don't tell me, um...
Ah, I'll be making this getaway in comfort.
No.
Actually, it's CheeseHead.
