This gets real uncomfortable after a while.
Good thing I've got this oxygen tank and mask, or otherwise there's no way I'd be able to hold my breath for this long.
: But it's not what you think!
SpongeBob, wait!
SpongeBob, please, let me explain! I'm just a cat with a dream.A dreamto give the gift of hope. See, above water, I'm a nobody: just another annoying cat. But down here, I'm someone special: someone who can make people happy. And if making the world a happier place makes me a criminal... then lock me up and throw away the key. Have mercy!
Really?
All right! Thanks, Bob. You're the best friend I ever had! Now if you'll excuse moi, I've got tosign some autographs.
Mm-hmm.
:I can't take it! I need oxygen!
:
Aww. It's okay, SpongeBob. Maybe the whole shamble is a big wake-up call to be honest.
I like it!
