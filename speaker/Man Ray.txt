Haha, with pleasure!
Well if it isn't Milk Maid Man! You've saved us the trouble of tracking you down!
You senile bag of fish paste! There are three of us and only one of you!
The Quickster!
Uh-oh.
World domination! Tell him we want world domination!
Come on, world domination!
Was that it? Oh, that's sickening.
Oh, Neptune, shut up!
The delicious new treat no mortal can resist?
Ooh, I just love the little pip-squeak patty,  small fries, and cold juice product.
How can I be evil with flavors this good?
That's exactly what I was hoping for.
Thanks for making this easy. Till next time!
Mable! I haven't seen you since high school.
Why certainly. Anything for the gal I went to the prom with.
Nor you.
Hey, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! I'd like you to meet Mable!
Mable?!
Ahhhh! Grrrrrr... You! It's on now! Filthy shorts attack!
Clothes basket bombardment!
Surrender! Mermaid Man?  Ow! That's it! Time for the spin cycle!
Wha?
Noooo! My head is dry clean only!
But I didn't do anything.
I wouldn't miss this for the world, Dirty! Hahahahah.
Good night, balloon boy!
It stands for the Bad Guys All Together For Book Club!
Why would we do that? We're almost to the new chapter!
You're mine!
Muhahahahahahahaha!  Huh? [ The inescapable display case! [ Noooooooooo!
HAHAHA! Or what?
OH NO!
Well well well! Not so tough without your Tartar...
I'm free! Hahaha!
By the supreme authority of wickedness, I, the evil Man Ray, command you to release me from this frozen prison at once.
Why.. Not?!
You mean, if I was good then you'd let me go?
Then, uh, in that case... I am good.
Yes, really.
Yes, yes, really, really.
Yes, yes, already! I'm good! I'm good! Now let me out of here or you'll suffer dire consequences.
You fools, prepare to be eradicated.  What's wrong with me? Hahaha. What is this... Hahaha. infernal contraption?!
I'll never get out of here wearing this belt. [chuckles] I... I need an evil plan that will trick them to take it off me.  Time for those acting lessons to pay off.
Oh, sob! Oh, cry.  Oh, woe is me. You don't know what it's like being evil for so long. Oh, how I wish to be... good. If only some kind heroes would show me the path to decency.
Ahh, that would be fantastic!  I'll fake my way through this just like I did in high school.
Excuse me, sir, but I do believe you've dropped your wallet.
What? I just saw you drop it. Here.
It is yours. I am trying to be a good person and return it to you.
Aren't you Patrick Star?
And this is your ID.
I found this ID in this wallet. And if that's the case, this must be your wallet.
Then take it.
You dim-bulb! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off!
Hello, friend. I noticed you were struggling with that package. Would you like some help?  Ow!
I noticed that...  Ow!
Could, Ow!
You butter-fingered pink thing! What's in that box anyhow?
Arghh!
It tickles but it's worth it.
Umm... 62?
Haha. Stop.
Frequency rising. Bel- Belt out of control. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Belt on too hard.  It's tickling my DNA. Make it stop!  Haha. Please!
The only thing I'm good at is being evil.  So long, suckers.
Out of my way, fools. You no longer have control of me. And now this town belongs to, ManRay!
Well, that was easy.  Hahaha. All right, people! Everybody stand right where you are.
I want you to, uh...  No! No! Stop giggling or I'll have to...  Stop laughing, you fools.
Well, I'll tell you what you can do.  Gimme all of your...  G-gimme, gimme all of your...  Give me...  Ahh! The belt is gone but I still feel it's tickle. The urge to do bad is gone.  I guess I'll just open a checking account.
No need to be alarmed, SpongeBob. Your teachings have transformed me. Besides, I have checks... with little poodles on them!  I won't be needing this anymore. Farewell, fellow do-gooder.
