Morning, Mrs. Puff. I'm Mr. Fitz. I represent the 'Boating School Teachers Accreditation Bureau'. As you know your teaching certificate is up for renewal. However, we have noticed there have been an unusual large number of failings from this classroom.
Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times.
We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher.
Okay, Mrs. Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced.
It's not you that failed, SpongeBob. It's Mrs. Puff that's failed you. You are relieved of your teaching duties.
Well, if there was a 'destroy the city' part of the test, you would have.
Sorry, SpongeBob, you failed again. Even our finest instructor could not teach you. Mrs. Puff, you're hired again.
