Hello, Encino!
You mean we're fired?
--and that's why you're my cookie-wookie teddy bear!
Twinkle, Twinkle, Patrick Star. I made myself a sandwich. My mommy named it Fred. It tastes like beans and bacon. And smells like it's been dead. Writing stuff is hard so I use a pointy pencil. Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Point. Pee-Yew, What's that horrible smell?
I have a head, it ends in a Point. Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Pointy, Point.  This song is over, Except for this line, you win this round, Broccoli!
