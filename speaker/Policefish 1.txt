Put those eyeballs back in your head, son! We've got a few questions for you.
Were you at the zoo on the day of the oyster incident?
Did you, or did you not take part in various activities of zoo-time merriment?
And are you familiar with... this peanut?
Just one more question... Is it true that you at the oyster's lair with a Mr. Patrick Star?
That's all we need to know, son. Let's book him!
Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge, Pinky!
