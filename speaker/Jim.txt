Krabs!
It sure is. I was on my way to my solid gold mansion next to my solid gold lake, when I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane.
Hey, that's new. "Employee of the Month", huh?
After I left The Krusty Krab I worked at some of the finest restaurants around the world. I got so successful, I was able to retire in luxury.
Oh, I... Don't sign what I didn't make.
You're on, Krabs! But I'll have to charge you!
Everyone, watch and learn!
One patty! The right way.
Oh, hey! You... You're the guy... who sweeps up, right?
Oh! You made that... stepped-on thing I saw earlier, right?
Besides don't step on the food?
Now that's the way to grovel. I'll do it!  The pickle slices were too thick.
Hold it... Hold it... Hold it... Okay.
Now, too much mustard, see?
Hey, Eugene, where's that little fry cook of yours?
Hey, great idea! And you can give me a raise!
What are you thinking, SpongeBob? I'm not taking your job.
Both those statements are true, SpongeBob, but there's a reason I left the Krusty Krab. It all started on a warm summer evening. Business was slow, so Squidward and I were having one of our famous bull sessions.  We should open our own restaurant if the jail is bulging now.
What if it never does? Don't you wanna have something to fall back on?
Well, while you go wig shopping, I'm gonna go talk to Mr. Krabs.  Hey, Mr. Krabs, you gotta second?
Cut the gas, Krabs, and dig this: I've been bustin' my conk for you. You better lay on some extra gravy, or I'm going to agitate the gravel.
You know, lay a patch.
Give me a raise, or I'm quitting.
Stop talking like that.
I need more money in my paycheck at the end of every week, capiche?
Well, Eugene, looks like you've got yourself another sucker. The kid's a good fry cook, but he'll only be a great fry cook when he finally gets the guts to quit this dump. Good luck, SpongeBob. You're gonna need it.
