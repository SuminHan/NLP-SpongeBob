Good work, man...  ...I see you've read my book? [female fish gasping]
None other.
What, these?
Well, I don't mean to brag, but uh...
Please, people, please. They'll be plenty of time to admire my body this weekend, at my annual summer shindig.
Can I help you, little fella?
Yeah, I don't think this is your type of party. I don't want to embarrass you guys... Hey everyone, check this out!  ...but this party is for the pig-mentally gifted.
And your skin is as light and smooth as a, well as a baby's bottom.
You're not coming to my party, without a tan.
Nice job Ma'am. Join the party! Ahem, but the baby's going to have to wait outside.
Yes, but...
Now don't worry Ma'am, he can wait out here, with the other rejects.
Next.  Hey! Hey! Hey! Looks like you two took my advice! Nice job gentlemen. Come on in!  All right, party people. It's time to roll out the portables.
I have seen this only one other time. It's the ultimate tan! He's...  ...Sun Bleached!
This young man... This young, hero, should be praised for his dedication to "tan-liness".  If you guys are feeling it, we should all follow in his foot steps.  Frankie, crank it up.
