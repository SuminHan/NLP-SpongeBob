Well, if it isn't little SpongeBob. Plant a firm one on me, Bobby.
Sure, Little Bobby. I could use some help with the lawn, but you're gonna need this to do the job right.

And when you're done, I've made a tomato and clam juice smoothie to refresh you.  Ah.  And how many candles you burning out there? Over.  Do you copy? Over?  Copy? Do you copy?
Well, of course you can.

They let that dangerous miscreant out of prison? Sounds like your parents are in trouble, kid.
Whoa there, Little Bobby. No can do.
No, no, I don't chase criminals these days. I'm retired, and if I were you, I'd consider turning around and going home. You're not cut out for this kind of work, boy. An innocent kid like you doesn't stand a chance against a criminal mind. Do you have any idea what people like that do to people like you?
Well, let's just say, I hope you've practiced walking without legs, or arms, or a body. But since you insist, I'll drive you all the way over to Blackjack's right now.  Just try to relax until we get there.  There it is. We're here.  Uh, lock the door behind you, kid.
