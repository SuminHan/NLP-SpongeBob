Wow! The big city! Well, time to make my fortune.
Shoo-Wee! This place sure is big and fancy-like! Gee, willigers! They got an ice cream parlor!  I'll take one scoop of vanilly ice cream, please.
Yep. I just got off from the train.
Howdy do, y'all?
Howdy partner!  Pardon, but is this stool taken?
Give me a shot of milk.
Two percent.
I drink this stuff every day. Over the lips and through the gums, look out tapeworm, here it comes! Get ready Tapey.  Aah,  Oh, yeah! Smooth.
The name's SpongeBuck. I left home to make my way here in the big city. I'm here for the job.
Sheriff? I'm not here for the sheriff job. I'm here for the fry cook job.  Back home, I'm known for my rootin-tootin, never-pootin chili. The spiciest chili west of the old west farm.
In a good way?
What happened to the old sheriff?
Gasp! And, why is he at boot hill?
Who's Dead Eye?
Hey! That's not your money!
I'm SpongeBuck, the new sheriff. Want some chili?
Coffin jockeys!?  You didn't say anything about that!
Hope I haven't missed the first post. Whoa, girl!
Uh huh.
Yep.
Sounds great!
Nope.
Whoa, gal, whoa! Whoa!  Looks like the end of the trail. We're out of food,  water, and lip balm!  I'm sorry old Paint! Guess I have to put you out your misery! So long old friend!
It does?
I ain't no sheriff. Or fry cook or even coffin jockey, and I'm no match for Dead Eye Plankton! I'm nothing.
I don't know,  Okay, okay! I'll do it! Just stop hurtin' me! Besides, you're right! It's time I stepped up and looked him in the eye! So, I'll go back to Dead Eye Gulch, whip Plankton, and save the town at high noon!
Thanks, idiot friend! But I don't know how we'll ever get back to Dead Eye Gulch by high noon.
Hi, guys! I'm back in the nick of time!
But it's only 11:55. The final showdown always takes place at high noon.
You can't give up! Before I came here, I would've given up, too. But in the short 20 minutes I've known you, I've come to love Dead Eye Gulch.
What I'm a saying is if we all team up together, we can stand up to Dead Eye Plankton, and run him right out of Dead Eye Gulch for good! So, what do you say?
That pillow sure packs a wallop!
I do believe I'd sit this one out.
Come on, guys! We can do this! If we work together!
I don't blame you for losing faith. I lost faith too. But then, I discovered the love of my new idiot friend. And we've come far. So I'm sure with all of us working together, in idiot friendship, we can beat Dead Eye and save the town! So let's huddle up and make a plan, together! Bzbzbzbzbzb
Bzbzbzbzbzbzb
Bzbzbzbzbzbzbzbzb
Umm...
No. To be honest, I didn't think I'd get this far.  But I know we can beat him! If we just work together!
You wish, Dead Eye! We are united! Right g-- Hey!
Well, you can hold the , because it's come down to you and me!
You forgot the most important part. I discovered the power of idiot friendship.
Wow! Fry cook!  Thank you, good people of Bikini Gulch! The statue is truly amazing! Maybe a little too heavy in the hindquarters, but still, if I ever have a Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson, I'd want him to look at this and say 'Hey! I'm proud of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather!'
Hey, Everybody! It's good to be here at the Krusty Kantina! We got a real special show for y'all tonight! Featuring my new best pal, this guy!  He's an idiot!
We're gonna sing a song about friends!
Well, listen up and I'll tell you! Who's there for you when you are sad and down?
Who puts thorns in you so you can save the town?
Who helps you pick your pants up off the ground?
Let's bring it home, idiot friend!
Who lets you ride on his coffin?
What do you and me have in common?
Thank you, thank you very much.
I sure am.
Okay. Right foot here.
Left foot here.  Right arm there.
Left there and  voila!
Isn't this fun?
I can't wait to see my pals over at the Krusty Kantina.  These doors seem to be stuck.
Wow, even me?
I'm ready to be tough.
Ow!
Ain't nobody gonna mess with me now.
Please don't hurt me!
