You looking for a job, deary?
Oh, my goodness. Are you in danger?
Come with me.
Oh, probably one of the many perfumes that we sell here at Grandma's Apron!
Congratulations! You're hired.
Ah!
Well, I can't quite afford to be picky these days.
The only other employee besides me was Myrtle, and she's...no longer with us.
Oh, don't let those bubble-headed nincompoops get to you, Pearly.
Life's not fair, my dear. We all go throughout hard times at some point.
Here, look. See?
I was different from the other girls, and they teased me for it.
They called me "Boring Beatrice." Not very creative, those girls.
Oh, good ol' Jonesy from the AV Club took that one!
All that matters, Pearly, my dear, is that things will soon change.
But in the meantime, you should be having as much fun as possible.
Let me show you how grandmas do it.
Now, now. girls. Let be polite.
Granny power! Power! Power!
Pearl, toss me the Autumn Years perfume.
Well, now that you're all sitting down, let me tell you about the first time i ever saw a talking picture show.
Oh, boy, did they know how to talk.
And that's why today, we all wear shoes.
Oh, Pearl, I'm so glad you enjoy being a grandma, but your friends make a good point.
You're only young once, you see. You don't want to grow up too fast or you'll miss out on all the fun.
Go have yourself some fun, my dear. Ah, ah, ah, ah.
How 'about a nice, gentle handshake instead?
I'll see you tomorrow.
