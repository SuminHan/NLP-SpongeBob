SpongeBob! There you are!
Nah, no, thanks. I had a late breakfast.
Well, because we can't breathe in Sandy's treedome, remember? It's filled with air.
There you go.
E-Exit the... Exit the treedome?!
Oh, SpongeBob, that's a great idea! Where should we goJellyfish Fields, Goo Lagoon, Barg'N-Mart, Lucky Larry's?
All right, let's go!
Yeah. Nothing can scare us.
We're lost.
You fools!
You sure?  It's worse! They're kissing!
I can't hold your eyelidsthey're too slippery!  Ow!
Oh, okay-kay, come on now, don't be all scared. I'll walk you home.
Let's just cross that bridge when we burn it.
Yeah! Are you okay?
Yeah., goodnight! Just don't think about the Fisherman!
Oh.  There.
Oh. The Fisherman's here.

I sure hope so. (SpongeBob and Patrick look into window and sees Squidward, laughing)
I don't want to die in my underwear!
Hey. Good idea. Let's trade.  Here you go.
Uh... Nope,I don't see it. Kenny's really gotten into your head lately.
