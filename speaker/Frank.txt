Will you hurry up?
Good to see you, SpongeBob. How's my number one customer doing?
Well, pleasure to meet you, Patrick.  That's your first lesson son, the granddaddy of all pranks. The joy buzzer.
You don't have to get it. The prank is for the enjoyment of the prankster.
Well, this came in just this morning.  Have some gum.  Ha! Exploding chewing gum. Only $9.95.
One dollar will get you this fake gag dollar--  fool your friends into thinking you've got a real dollar.
A whoopee cushion.
Fake vomit.
Real vomit?
Well, there is one prank that I've been saving for a real top of the line prankster.  Invisible Spray!
Good choice. Now be careful with that stuff, boys. It stains clothes.
Hey, I was bitten by a snail. I kinda feel off balance.  Whoa.
Oh no, it's spreading through the air!
Stop! You can't let anyone in!
They're zombies. They only want to dine on our flesh.
I don't work here.
Nice wig.
I told you that movie was terrible.
Oh, man. I can't wait. I am so stoked on dancing right now.
What's he doing?
Lucky.
Susie, no!
and this is the maximum level. Since this is your first day, I'll let you peek at our number one inmate.  He's too dangerous to let him around the other inmates.
Worse! He'd tried to steal the Krabby Patty formula.
So that's why we keep him behind these impenetrable 6-inch steel doors.  Of course, it helps to lock it.  He's gone! He's so small, he could be anywhere!
You know, I'm not really hungry.
Liar!
But who would do such a thing?
What?
I'll say!
: Looks boring. Can I just have a Krabby Patty?
Are they free?
Sounds great. But I left my wallet up on the sand.
Uhh... Hello.
What? Who told you?
Yeah, whatever you say, man!
No.
Order #20 ready for pickup.
Things just got lame again.
No refunds!? Well, I guess we're stuck here, then.
That was incredible!
I thought he was in reform school or something.
Hey, free Krabby Patties!
Me, too! But that deluxe Krabby Patty was so swimmin' good, I'm gonna get another one!
It looks like it says, "NEW: ULTRA CHUMMY PATTIES PACKED WITH QUADRUPLE GRILLED GOODNESS!"
Are you going to eat that?
Okay.
Hello, can I order? Hello?
I'll take five!
We shouldn't be so disrespectful of our favorite meal.
I'll take twenty.
That song. It sounds just like... Martha!
Hmm...I could've sworn that sign said "Open."
My! What an interesting shape! Are those for sale?
Well, that would depend on the price.
Hmm...sure! I suppose so!
Now you're talking!
It's new! Tastes just like a Krabby Patty but it's shaped like a wiener!
Ha. Any time kids. What the?
Hey, you guys put in a drive through!
Great, I'll have three large Krabby Patties, Krabby Fries, a Krabby Cola, and 2 extra large orders of Krabby Rings.  Is this toothpaste?
Hey, those guys are insane!
Hey!
Yum yum yum yum yum yum. YUM! YUM!  Hey, buddy boy, take my wallet, I gotta have more!
You know, that was weird. I had to flush the toilet twice.
We want our money back. All 46,853 of us.
Gold Team rules!
This is a load of barnacles.
Uh... uh, wait!  Uh, here he is!
Make a wish, honey.
I wish I could eat this, but I'm so darn full. Oh well.
