The lovely Patricia  has returned to us!
Extraordinary. And may I add that those are very impressive breeches you are wearing.
What is your name?
Well, SpongeRobert, how would you like to join us. We're going to a party.
What are you looking for, SpongeRobert?
This is the party.
Oh, SpongeRobert, if it weren't for your pants, I'd take you for the type of immature ignaramus that would frequent the Krusty Krab!
You're incorrigible! But le cinema is a delightful idea. There is a foreign film at the arthouse I've been meaning to see. It's called, "The Table."
SpongeRobert? Yoohoo? Are you coming? We're going to drink some more coffee and watch the nightly news.
Now you really sound like one of those nitwits that frequents the Krusty Krab!
Ahh! A peasant in longpants!
Let's leave this bottomfeeder.
