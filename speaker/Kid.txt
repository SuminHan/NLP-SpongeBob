Ahem.
It's my birthday.
Cool.
It makes me want to hurl.
Oh, boy.
Twick-ow-tweat!
Oh, that smarts!  Bullseye!
What are you? Thick? Every kid in town's got a whirly brain!
Eat my brainstem slowpoke!
Mommy, look! It's Frankenstein!
Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
I want a balloon animal.
What is it?
