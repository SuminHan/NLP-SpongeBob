Oh, Neptune, surely this isn't the behavior befitting a king, hiding in bed for days on end, doing nothing but watching daytime television.
Is this about turning 5,000 today?
Let's forget about Triton for just one day. It's your 5,000th birthday, for shell's sake.
Oh, husband, I'm so glad to see that you're enjoying your birthday party.
And I'm glad that you're glad that I'm glad, my king.
Nope, there's nobody missing, we're all here.
Triton is our son. But as you can see, the king doesn't want to talk about it right now.
Take those sandwiches away! Can't you see the king is upset?  It's okay, let it out.
Why have you not obeyed me, mortal? Be gone!
Oh, how...nice?
Too do loo.
