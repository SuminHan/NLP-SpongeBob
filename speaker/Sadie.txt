Oh, what can I do for you two nice young men?
That sounds heavenly! I'll take one.
[Sadie looks at her watch] I don't have time for this.
What is it, Peterson?
I don't know but it's hideous, isn't it?
Jerk!
That man was being nice to my little girl.
Tommy? I've got a fresh load of laundr...  Tommy! Oh! Oh, dear me, no!  Hello, it's an emergency! My son! He's...
Oh, oh you kids and your crazy dance fads.
Oh, look at you, you're so small, tiny and helpless.
Why, you're so tiny and helpless, I could give you formula whenever I wanted to and you couldn't do a thing about it.
Well, all this waiting around for someone to get mauled is making me a bit hungry.
Why thank you.
Ten dollars? Why would I pay ten dollars, when I can go across the street and get a Krabby Patty for one dollar?
No, I suppose not.
Ah, fine, whatever.
That was appalling! What was in that?
[her lower lip covered with a lot of spit] Oh barnacles. That's foul!
Oh, look at those gorgeous wrinkles.
Monster!
Oh yeah? Then prove it!
Congratulations! You're my 100th customer!  From now on, you can come back and have all the free ice cream you want!
Aww... does someone need a hug?
Don't fight the love, kid.
That sounded like a threat!
What the?
Did you hear that, Neptune said it was all because of that guy!
AAAAAHHHH!
Why, thank you, young man!
Well, actually, I...
Wow, you're good. How did you know all that? Are you like a psychic? Oh, oh, oh! Tell me what I'm thinking!
I've never seen such a terrible thing! Doctors, run this snail to the room!
Don't you worry, Gary. I'm just going to give you some tests. It'll be over before you know it.
It's okay, honey, the tests are over. I'm just going to give you a little pill.
Open wide.
There, that wasn't so bad, was it?  That's not good...  Uh, Mr. SquarePants?
The doctors say there's nothing we can do. It's best to take your snail home and let nature take it's course...
Thanks, Snailguy!
He's so dreamy!
Hey, put some clothes on!
