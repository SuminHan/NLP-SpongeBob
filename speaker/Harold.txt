I'd like to order-
One patty please.
Come on, move it! Could you be any slower? And you've had your blinker on for the last five blocks.
Get off of me!
This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!
What's your problem?
Ghosts!
All my wishes have already come true.
Umm, using the wishing well.
And... that's it. Nothing else happens.
Can we have our quarter back now?
No, don't get near it. Oh, the pity of it all!
SpongeBob's been infected by his own pet snail. Oh, the irony! Quick, we must quarantine that infected snail before he bites every last Bikini Bottomite. Let's get the snail!
Hand over the snail.
Stop the madness, man. The Mad Snail Disease ends now. Seize the snail!
I was planning to, why?
Hey! What gives you the right to take my food?
This isn't fair.
Ooh, I feel protected now.
Sir, you have a serious medical condition.
This song always makes me think of you.
Pitchforks! You can't be an angry mob without pitchforks!
Take cover! The teenagers, they've been let out of school and they're pelting us with balloons filled with...
Save yourself, kid. I'm finished.
Oh.
Hold it. Sponges don't have eardrums.
So, uh, where's the food?
Do you always serve your food this way?
Excuse us, but we have a battle to re-enact.
Ah, come on! Let's go play somewhere else.
Or hockey!
I could use this.
This is top quality.
Oh, we thought you were taking a dirt nap, but we organized your clothes for you... SpongeBob.
Isn't this your name?
You don't know your name?
Err, well, then I'll remind you that these are not your clothes, and your name isn't SpongeBob, it's, umm... it's... CheeseHead BrownPants. Ha ha! That's it!
Bubbles?!
I can see!
Wait it's him! The handsome man!
Quit shoving.
That's called shoving.
Yes, it is.
Yes!
We're just waiting in line to buy a Krabby Patty.
Hmm...I'd like a...
Yeah, let's go see what this fat guy is yelling about.
By who?
Yeah, does it?!
Yeah, I don't even know what that IS!
You're hideously white skin just ruined the party. I mean look at you... do you hug your mother with that skin?
He taught my grandmother how to read!
Well, I guess I won't be eating those.
My mouth can't take these conflicting flamers!
I got it! Ugh!
I am so sorry.
This place is disgusting!
Come on, let's go.
He's... dancing!  Ok, people, just back away slowly...
Can you direct me to the Krusty Krab please?
This guy's act is stale! We crave excitement!
Hey, ew!
Great, we get to see two for the price of one!
Fine.
Yeah, I want a refund.
Hey, hey. Chill out, buddy. We all want to get into the Krusty Krab as much as you do.
Oh!
What do we want?
What do we welcome?
You know, this stuff is hideously inedible, but the decor is so amazing, I can't resist spending my money here!
Look! A naked chipmunk!
Hey, look at that!
There! Right up there!
A little to the right...
There's an new sign up at the Krusty Krab! It says they're serving something called a deluxe Krabby Patty!
You're telling me, I'm gonna try one!
Man am I stuffed!
Sounds like a plan!
How do I get out of here?
Ahh! Mermaid!
Why, hello there little fello. Are you a stray.  There you are. Isn't that better?
No. no I haven't seen any stray snails near by.
You!  Come back here! You gotta help me clean this place up!  You brought this on yourself, Harold. No I didn't Harold. Yes you did Harold. Harold I did not.
Gosh, he's right.
That guy's on to something. What are you hiding from us, Mayor? Do you have some secret? Is the end near?
Then how did you survive?
Well, don't keep us in suspense. How did you stop it?
What kind of sacrifice?
I knew it! We have to sacrifice the most miserable person!
Well, it certainly isn't me!
Neptune's trousers! What's that?!
Spinach and chocolate spaghetti in calamari sauce. You wanna bite?
I never got my patty!
Wow, a Flabby Patty.
We're still trying to get out of our driveways!
Hey! Tony Jr,  wanna sign my lunch box?
HEY! I was here first!
Neptune be praised!
Woah woah woah woah, you can't cut in line. We've been waiting for a Krabby Patty for three stinking days!
Got anything else?
He's so eccentric!
You know what? Let's go across the street to the Chum Bucket.
Hey, waiter! An empty plate!?
Son of a seahorse! Twenty years of training and a couple of amateurs just leap out of a balloon! Here!  You plant it!  All that time and money and resources wasted on...
Stupid amateurs...  Fantastic...
Free Krabby Patties?!
: I'm sorry, I did not order a side of lips with my patty!
I'm taking my clams, elsewhere.
I agree! The world would be a much better place with Glove World! is closed down for good!
Yes, and I'm very puzzled.
Well, I don't know I'd go that far.
Coming down with something?
Me too. Let's get outta here!
That does not look like Ned and the Needlefish!
CHASE 'EM OFF STAGE!!!
Amazing!
Well! It looks delightful!  This thing's frozen!  BARNACLES! How am I supposed to drink this!?  GAH!  This shake is disgusting!  Why you probably don't even have a license to milkshake!
Your milkshake license expired seven years ago!? OUTRAGEOUS! I DEMAND A REFUND!
You redeemed yourself SpongeBob! This is the BEST milkshake I'd ever had!
Thanks, Kenny!
: The satisfaction earnings of the fourth quarter of my lunch are off the charts!
: Get a load of this guy! A sandwich!
Uh, hello? Hey, man. I'm super hungry. Where's my food, dude?
Uh, I'm not so super hungry all of a sudden. And also, I'm super not paying!
Now that's the taste I remember.
Yeah, right.
Hello!
My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!
What's wrong, grass? Why won't you grow? Talk to me.
I'll never mow you again!
Oh yeah, we are definitely out of here.
Congratulations.
Once again, congratulations.
Two hours is long enough! That's it!
Boo-boo Keys...
Why, yes, it is.
No, what?
Hey, do you sell food here?
That thing's green!  Green!
Hey, is that one purple? Purple is my favorite color!  This ain't half bad! Hey, world! "Pretty Patties" is the best idea ever!
Hey, where'd he go?
Hey, hey funny guy! I've got a joke for you! What smells rotten and puts people to sleep?
No! Your act!
Why?
Well, maybe we wouldn't sound so bad if some people didn't try to play with big, meaty claws!
Big... Meaty... !
Bring it on, old man! Bring it on!
Yeah, for the fireman!
Dude, can I have some ketchup?
Did he just say?!
I declare these Fry Cook Games... open!
I declare these Fry Cook Games...
... open!
Some say he crawled out from the lowest trench in the ocean.
Quit fooling around, man. Get in the water.
Thanks!
Pardon me?
Thanks.
So, you like kicking butts, do ya? Well we'll show you, old man!
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man!?
