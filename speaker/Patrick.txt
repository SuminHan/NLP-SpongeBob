Go, SpongeBob!  Whoa!
Where do you think you're going?
No you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get that job!
Whose first words were "may I take your order"?
Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?
Who's a, uh who's uhh. oh! who's a big yellow cube with holes?
Who's ready?
Who's ready?
Who's ready?
Good morning, Krusty Krew!
One Krabby Patty, please.
Who said that? Are you a ghost?
Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me!
Uhh... I'll have an uhh... uhh... uhh... ah...  Huh? What's that?
The ceiling is right Squidward, you're not a very good employee.
Uhh... uhhhh...
Great idea, Squidward! One Krabby Patty, please.
Me neither.
Hi, SpongeBob.
Sure?
Thanks.
Not bad, not bad.
It's been very mild, yes.
Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it.
Nice to meet you Patrick.
Yeah.
Was he talking to me or you?
"Nod politely."
Yeah. Knock, knock.
So, do you come here often?
Hello, SquarePants residence. What? I'm sorry, what?
You wanna talk to SpongeNob?
Okay, hold on.  SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!
Sorry, he's not out there.
Thanks.  Here you go, SpongeBob.
That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!
Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!
Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya!
Hey, the mail's here! What did you get?
This guy's got shoes!
Is that gonna hurt?
Uh...  More time for thinking.
A chocolate bar?
Make way for a couple of ontre-prenyouers!
Yes sir. With or without nuts?
We'll take twenty!
Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!
He said we were mediocre...
Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!
Oh, okay.
I love you.
We got him now!
Hee hee, it tickles!
I'll take 10!
Huh?
Huh?
Did you say something?
Focusing.
Nice place you got in here.
I can't understand anything
Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.
Not the way I use them!
Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.
The kill!
You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.
Hooray for lying!
It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.
You'll fall in love!
You'll walk through walls!
This'll be the best lie yet!
I can live with that.
No! Don't hurt us, Tom. Please Spare Me!
Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?
But what are we going to spend it on?
I do!
I can finally touch my toes!
The whose abouts of what?
Does this mean we're not getting pizza?
Four!
I'll save you, Quickster, ahh!
Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?
Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?
Wait for you to get back!
Hey, that's a great idea!
Wow.
And no line!
And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?
Where is everyone?
6:20? But I thought you said you were late.
Hey!  When did I start wearing a watch?
Ohh!
Ohhh!
Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!
But look at all the stars you have! I'll never be that good.
Who said that?  Was it him?
What does he teach us?
Life! death! Life! death! Life! death! Life! death! Life! death!
Sorry.
I'm learning!
Who's the fat kid talking to?
Oh.
Uh...uh...
Uh...uh...UH!...24!
Why are they laughing?
Oh.
24.
What?
Let me hear it.
Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?
Sure thing, buddy.
Psst! SpongeBob?
SpongeBob, over here!
Psst, SpongeBob!  Psst, SpongeBob!  SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.
Hi.
Hey buddy! Funny stuff in there, funny stuff!
Who cares about a stupid star?
I'll deal with you after class!
I don't see anyone fighting, do you?
Well, don't mind if I do!
SpongeBob and I were fighting.
I hate you more.
Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you.
I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you.
Ohh...  Hmph!
Ohhhhh...!
I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs...
Me too! Let's save Roger!
Ahh. Light bulb!  But why does it have to be so far away?  I'm coming, SpongeBob!
Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm!
Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class! See ya, SpongeBob. See ya, Big Fat Meanie.
Poor guy.  Hey, check out Squidward's new snail.
Wow, a snail made out of bread.
Sunday?
Hmmm, 'Property of Squidward Tentpoles.'
No!
Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward!
Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail.
Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race.
Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail.
Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel.
My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?
You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants!
Good one, Squidward.
A burglar!
This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here.
It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it.
Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you.
Good morning, Krusty Krew!
Yeah, it's gonna rock!
I'm already hearing voices!
Well, how rude of some people!
Party!
What shouldn't we do first? We're young,  we've got wheels,  the world is our oyster! SpongeBob, you got something on your shoulder.
Yes.
I don't know, SpongeBob. He might cramp our style.
Let's see if he knows the secret cool-guy handshake.
I'm waiting... old man.
Fine, and you? All right, you're in. But I'm not happy about it.
I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, SpongeBob?
I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party, Mr. Krabs?
Let's party!
Debauchery!
Sorry.
I'm feeling it, SpongeBob!
I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
I said, I guess you're gonna miss the panty raid.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Give us some credit, old man. We're panty professionals!
Is it time already to ruin Squid's day?  Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me!
Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!
Squid's taking it real hard. So what are you gonna do now?
No, wait a minute, no you don't.  We can build you a new house!
Well, sure, its easy! I built my house all by myself!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
We're done!
I wish I lived there.
No.
Tartar sauce.
Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!
Yeah! We'll be rockmates!  Good night, SpongeBob.
Spiders! Spiders! Spiders!
Spiders! Spiders!
Aww, I got dead again! This game stinks!
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
No, your other bottom!
Not until 4.
Do it again! I wasn't looking!
That was fun.
That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk!  Sorry.
Or your other armpit!
Never ever?
Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?!
Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?!
Thank you, Chip.  I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward!
Oh.
And that's when I punch him, right?
I caught one!  Huh?
That penny has the most beautiful voice.
Ice cream!
Two ice creams!
Still two ice creams!
Washing an old person!
What do we do?
Right!
Yeah, it's all crushy-looking.
Genius!
Of course!
Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over.
Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going . Over.
Yummy!  Patrick to SpongeBob. The deliciousness has landed!
Pretty weenie!
Bum! Bum! Bum!
Sing another song...
SONG! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E...
Yeah! And Fake Science Monthly!
Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!
Flashlights are their natural prey.
Yeah.
...in a goofy fashion!
Or a hoop skirt.
Ever...
Duh!
SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!
Good thinking! All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack.
Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once.
Pretend to be somebody else!
The sound of a sea bear attack.
Hi, SpongeBob!
Hi, SpongeBob.
As I do every morning.
That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!
My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!
You lost your name tag?
I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say "hi", just like this morning.
What?
Hi.
Hi, SpongeBob.
I won't.
What's my motivation?
Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry.  I'm sorry. Let's try it again.  Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai...  Who's SpongeBoob? I said SpongeBoob! Again, again. Sorry people.  I've got the giggles.
Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?
That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!
Well, then we'll look in the dumpster!
That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost.  Hop on, pal.
I wish I had a nose.
Cannonball!
Okay.
I'm looking. I'm looking.
I'm looking as fast as I can.
Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?
Yes.
Could I have another hint?
Hey, SpongeBob...
I know where your name tag is.
Uh... I can't remember.
There it is!
Uh... I forgot again.
Could you give me a hint?  There! I see it!
Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.
Don't mention it, buddy.
What's that contraption, SpongeBob?
Well, it's like my grandpa used to say.
You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!
We better do what he says. He knows how to grow food!
Ready!
Oh boy, a birthday party!
Can we have the cake now?  Happy, happy birthday to you!
Okay!
Oh boy, Seanut Brittle--Gimmie!
Nice try, SquarePants, but it's not gonna work this time. I'm gonna have some of your delicious Seanut Brittle!  Where's the Seanut Brittle?
[While beginning to cry] Seanut Brittle?
Hey, Seanut Brittle!  Oh, darn it, not again!
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
But I can see it.
What are we gonna do with it?
That's the ultimate prank! Good idea, SpongeBob!
OK, I'm ready.
Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?
I think since spraying the park bench was my idea, I should get to spray it.
Yeah, but I said it was a good idea!
Hey, the invisible spray works!
I gotta  it to you, SpongeBob. You look kinda funny.
Yeah.  I see what you mean.
Oh hey, I think this thing is empty.
Hey, I think I found our pants.  Oops! Here, these are yours.
Hey SpongeBob, do you know what time it is?
Gee, it's getting late.
Don't mention what?
Me.
Hey, I'm no ghost! The nerve of that guy and his driving eyeballs.
Lay it on me.
Yeah.
Who's gonna be our next victim?
Yeah.
It says he isn't scared of ghosts.
Nice try, Krabs, but we replaced all the glass with rubber.
We got him good, SpongeBob.
Uh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, we're visible again.
Me too.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Leaping lampreys, Mermaid Man. I'm right behind you.
Donuts.
Jumping Jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield!
Right, Mermaid Man.
What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh!
It's too bad they're old.
Ooh! Pretty lights!
Did you re-unite our heroes?
Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that.
It's working.
Hehehehehe.
It's the Raging Whirlpool.
Yeah, we did it.
All thanks to you. .
No problem, buddy. I always wanted to go to a mattress store.
Yeah.
10.
Hey, you didn't even help pay.
I thought it was your idea.
And we got you a card.
Nope.
I knew it!
' Wow, he really does care.
What a dump.
Hey, SpongeBob, isn't that the mattress over there?
Why not?
Hey, wait a minute, what are you gonna do?
Gee, thanks buddy.
Wow.
Where? I can't see them.
Let's do it again.
Squidward, what are you doing in there? You were suppose to keep watch.
Why are we called 'Worm-bait?'
Uhh, SpongeBob?
I think I know why our code name is "Worm-bait".
Ohh, SpongeBob, he likes your wooden spoon.
See if he plays catch.
Gimme that cologne.
That guard worm doesn't look very happy.
Trick or treat.
Hey, SpongeBob!
What are you doing?
How is Gary?
Oh, sure, but there was something I wanted to tell you...something important. Oh, I remember. Uh...  Who was I talking to?
I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him.  That's strange. Usually, I knock on the with this hand.  Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob?
SpongeBob, what happened?  This picture is crooked. SpongeBob!
Snap out of it.
What is it, buddy? You can tell me.
You what?
Because... many years ago, I took that challenge.
Uh-huh.
I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me.
Thanks, buddy.
Yeah?
About a week.
Hmmm... well...  Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days.
Huh?
Eight?
I only tasted six types of sediment.
Oh.
No, but I'll keep looking.
There's one place we haven't checked.
Can't hurt to look.
What is it?
What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See? Right there and there.
It's the apocalypse! Office products falling from the sky!
But I thought you drove him away with your neglect and indifference.
Hey, their having a sale on scented pine cones.
Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones.
Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!
Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary.  Um...uhh...
I want peanuts.
Just let it out, buddy. That's right.
Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood! [SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] They were awesome!
Hey, watch where you're going.  Newspaper monster!
Secret ritual.
No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better.
Maybe.
Our new president is a genius!
Hold still, buddy.
Okie dokie.
It is a lovely day for a ride in the country.
Did you find him, SpongeBob?
Or maybe he's on a secret mission!
Danger!?
I say he checks out a-ok!
Yeah, I guess we aren't good neighbors after all.
Wow! Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood!
Nope.
That's not it, either.
Sure, Sandy.
Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?
What'd you say?
Hey, what the...
Right foot first...
You can't? Oh, I know what to do!  That usually knocks him out.
Hi, SpongeBob.
What happened?
Let me take a look.  Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match.
Look, he's waking up.
So they cut it out.
Yeah, wanna see it?  It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around.
Nope.
Right behind ya, SpongeBob.
Methinks it's mutton-tastic.
Nuh-uh.
SpongeBob, help!
Glad that's over.
What does a guy have to do get some mutton around here? I'm starving!
What's that?
Oh no, I think I left the water running at home!
Yay!
I'm not sure that there's anything I can add at this point.
I guess so. I'm gonna miss you, SpongeBob.
I guess this is what you call the royal treatment.
Look out trouble!
Yeah, we need some gloves.
This is awesome.  Hey, SpongeBob, get out here!  Whoa, SpongeBob you look incredible.
Ooh!
No, uhh, I mean yes. Yes! That's what I said, heh. Yes.
No! No! No!
I'm right here and I don't believe it.
Yeah. Hey, can we eat those Krabby Patties now?
Yay!  Hey!
Huh? No! No! No-o-o! The horror. The horror.
It is?
Try telling that to Squidly.
Huh?
Yeah!
And they weren't nice to them either.
Why don't we just make our own movie?
Popcorn?
Oh, oh, oh...
Yeah, yeah. Ooh! I got one! "Adventures in the Underground City".
Well, there's a city...
And it's underground...
And they have an adventure...
The end.
I have an idea. Let's make it longer!
Yeah, and then he...umm...he drinks...cheese coffee.
Hey...
Good morning, SpongeBob.
Yeah, I got the footage.
Oh, it's a camera.
Oh, that's a lens cap.
Yup, I didn't want to lose it so I put it there right before we started filming.
You're it.
Huh?  Duuhh... aaann... ger...  cliff!
The rest of me is up here.
I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.
Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.
Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.
Yes...  I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner.
Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.
Yes, quite.
Indeed.
Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?
Doesn't feel like fun.
I'd like a Krabby Patty, please.
Ok, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?
Sometimes I just need to get away from it all.  Wow, this hotel has everything!
I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study!
Oh, ok.  Do you mind?!  Don't look!  Done!
I'll need some help with my bags.
This is a hotel?
What about my Krabby Patty?
I don't tell you how to live  life!
Wow.
Squidward, wait!  Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from.
Hold on a second, SpongeBob.  Here you are, my good man.
There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend  Squidward!
I don't like crusts on my sandwich!
Peel it.
Could you do one more thing for me?
Good idea, Squidward!
I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me.
Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean.
Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!
Hooray!
Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place  fancy!  Cannonball!
That was a hotel?
This is a hospital?
Hey, SpongeBob!
My pants!
The nerve of some people.
Wow.
Let me try!
Oh, sorry.
Yeah!
What's it saying?
What'll we do?
Right.
Yeah!
Right!  I made an invention. It's a stick you can draw or write stuff with.
Ooh, ooh, this is a good one! It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark.
SpongeBob, I know this one will work. I've invented a parallel universe.
Somebody keeps stealing my ideas!
Who?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You guys talk funny. Say more words!
And I used to be dumb.
And I am Professor Patrick.
Doctor Professor Patrick. Don't mind him. You know how interns are.
I thought she ran away because she couldn't invent anything.
That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick to you!
Good idea.
Hey, you're the unpaid intern. You do the work.
Step right up.  You look like you've been neglecting your personal hygiene.
As sure as I'm a doctor professor.
Okay.
Thank you, lowly assistant.
It's okay. The horrible screaming means that it's working!
It works! It works!
That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.
Sorry.
My turn.  Whoo-hoo!  All right!
Oh my gosh. Who said that?
How do you know my name?
Ok, magical talking trashcan.  I wish SpongeBob were here to see this.
Hi, SpongeBob! I got my wish.
But I got my wish.
Tag, you're it.
Tag, you're it.
Tag, you're it.
Tag, you're it.
And I fell on my head.
Yeah.
Is that good?
It's the only thing I've ever done.
Hi, Squidward.
Party!
Tag, you're it.
Tag, you're it.
Yeah, you should work out more.
I don't get it.
What does claustrophobic mean?
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho!
Darn.
And you got your elbow in my ribs.
And stop stepping in my potato salad.
Oh, you mean like this?
Nice try, Squidward, but there's no Santa Claus here.
Lucky.
My ice cream! It's alive!
Oh, SpongeBob, it's you.
SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.
Sorry, officer.
What crime?  I'm a bad person!
I wanna be good!
Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream!
Hmmm...
Hello, brothers.
It's the maniac! Take him away! Take him away!
Yeah, uh huh.
Horrible!
SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer.
I don't wanna be a policeman anymore! I'm scared!
I wanna go home!
Hurry SpongeBob, I think it's getting...  ...dark.
Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo.  Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
At the intersection of Conch and Coral.
Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly!  Get out of there, SpongeBob!  That's his maniac shriek. He's going to attack!  He's acting all crazy! Run! Hide behind that building!  No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign!  No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light!  No wait, he's there, too! Run for your life!
The maniac's in the mailbox!
Well, let's not forget the worst of them all: Mad Snail Disease.
You mean your pet hasn't been vaccinated for mad snail disease?  Looks like the rash has already started.
Tell me, do you have any soreness of throat?
This disease will ravage your body with bloodshot eyes, loss of balance, messy pants, ticklish rib cage, severely untrimmed toenails, and finally, the bite from that infected snail will turn you into... a zombie.
You need to get that snail of yours to a doctor before he bites someone important.  There's a mad snail on the loose!
That mad snail is coming! If he bites you, you'll turn into a zombie.
Or is it?
I don't believe that's the real SpongeBob. He looks pretty zombie-fied. Just look at how yellow he is.
Perhaps not. Now, I got my eye on you!
You're right.  I'm a zombie!
Yeah. What do you know about it?
Well, does that mean we're not zombies?
Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.
Hi, SpongeBob.
Ok, boss.
Wow.  Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher.  Wow. It scratches backs, too!
Huh?
Hello? Hello? Hello?  Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear.  Hey, I just cleaned that one.
It talks!
Working at the Krusty Krab. Making krabby patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember.  Huh?
SpongeBob? Is that you?
SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh!
I'll save you.
I'm saving you from that brain-eating alien that's attacking your...  ...head!
Oh, sorry.
Well, I thought it was a new type of cotton candy you wear on your head.
Then what is it?
A wig?  Oh, boy. Don't you think that's a little silly?  Oh, man, it's time for my weekly condiment soak.  Do you mind?
SpongeBob.
Look at my new wig.
Don't be sad, SpongeBob. You can borrow one of mine.  Just wash it before you return it.
Whirlpool.
Hi, SpongeBob.
What are you doing?
Wow! I've never been in a submarine. Let's look inside.
Oh, man! Could you guard it from the inside?
Hmm.  "Shrink." I do have a lot of issues.
You're so tiny.  A giant SpongeBob!
Sandy's grown to gigantic size!
That's silly. Don't you think it's more likely that the entire world grew?
I don't know, but it's a real dump.
She's in there?  I'll save you, Sandy!
I thought this place was in bad shape.
No, give it back!
Finished.
Like this!
We can filter the CO2 through our ballast tanks, refire the engines, and ride the shock wave out of here!
What plan?
SpongeBob, do what you were born to do! Dance!
Grow?
Squidward, the toilet's backed up again.
Uh, me?
I gotta get out of town!  Oh, thanks SpongeBob.
I gotta get going! He told me to!
Uhh, well, uhh... hmmm, I'm not sure. But he had a briefcase.
It'll have to be one of your other chums 'cause my mind is set.
I guess I'll pack up my stuff and get ready to go.  My clothes.
My peanut butter!
And my pickles!
It's the end of me. Being here.
I'm sorry, there's no stopping the unstoppable. Patrick Star will live no more, forever... in Bikini Bottom.
Oh, no. I'm not Patrick Star?
Huh?  There ya go, Patrick. No one will know it's you.  Patrick, you okay?
Yeah, well, thanks ol' SpongeBob for your help. It was a noble effort but alas, all in vain, it's no use. I must leave.  Goodbye rock. Goodbye coral.  YOW!  Goodbye seaweed.
Goodbye sky.
Oh, I know, I know! I could be Mr. Seaweed Monsterman. And live happily forever after in Bikini Bottom.
D'oh!
Oh, I'm not his girlfriend. I'm Pat...
No.
Do it again. Do it again.
Do it again, do it again.
Yeah. We're here...
Could you turn it up?
Squidward, what's this about?
Is he the bad guy?
Squidward?
Squidward?
Squidward?
Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny.
I dunno. Let's get a closer look.
Yeah, help him. Go away. Can't you tell nobody wants you? You're endangered.
And some kibble.
I don't think Gary likes Smelly.
Ah! He can come home with me.
No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets.  Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch?  Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.  Almost.  Again.  So close.  Yeah, now you're...  Smelly! What's gotten into you?!  Hello, Animal Control? There's a wild animal loose in my house.  Sure, I'll hold.  Smelly! Come back. Smelly!
You're absolutely right.  It needs mustard.
Oh, yeah.  This one, right?
Mmm, good plan.
You're my hero.  SpongeBob! Help! Ah!
What! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud!
I'll let Smelly go first.
I think we lost them.
Hey, I see light.
I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob. Me, too, buddy. Me, too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong.
Hi, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?
That's awful. How tragic. Poor Squidward.
Did you say frozen dessert?
Oh...soft serve.
Oh, sorry.
But he's so tasty!
It's pistachio.
[examines the torn box] Warning: From ages 9 to 99.
Hey, SpongeBob, there's a guy over here talking into a tubey thing.
Why's he saying the same thing Mister Magic's saying?
We could always eat him. I'm kind of hungry.
Hey SpongeBob? I'm still hungry. Can you turn me into a jar of mayonnaise so I can eat myself?
Right here, buddy.  Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards.  Mmm.
Hey, learning tastes good.
Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.
Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.
Who's a winner?
Who's a winner?
Who's a winner?!
How'd you do, winner?  Let's see that license.
Are they gonna mail it to you?
No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.
We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.
Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.
You're not the judge of me.
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
I passed my test!
Yeah, I thought you said it was hard.
Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license.
How do I look?
Ready.
Does that mean I get a free key chain?
Oh.
Yeah! All right!
Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.
The horn works.  Whoo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?
Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.
Then you can get a free boat just like me.
I try to serve as an inspiration to others.
I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?
No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian.
I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep.
You will never guess what happen to me today.
Yeah!  But that's not all.
Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life.
Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?
Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.
No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license.
The horn still works.  Hey, SpongeBob.
Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image.
Boy, driving is so easy.
Do you want me to give you lessons?
Oh!
Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.
What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.
SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.
Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.
Let's see what this baby can do.
Yeah, yeah.
What? Where? Who?
So?
I think the driving genius knows what he's doing!
They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?
How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!
I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face!
Litterbug?! No!
I don't know! I don't have a license anymore.
So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.
SpongeBob!
Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.
It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.
How's that?
Ready, buddy?
Yeah?
I know exactly who you are!
SpongeBob, help! He's onto me! I don't have much time!
I have to get rid of these books!
I'll show you why.  See him? He's from the library. He knows about my overdue books.  Uh-huh. Which means I'm gonna get thrown into the big house. And you know what that means...
Exactly!
Ooh, what is it?  This is the worst-tasting gift ever!
What is?
What's a king?
Anything I want?  SpongeBob, do you think we can get something to eat?
King needs food badly.
I'll have ten Krabby Patties, a Krabby milkshake, large fries...
Tasty.
Uh-huh, that sounds great. Hey, can I get a little more ketchup?
Oh sorry, Mr Krabs, no can do. As king of Bikini Bottom, I am allowed to have anything I want. Isn't that right, SpongeBob?
Are you gonna eat that?
I want it.
Tell him, SpongeBob.
I thought you said I could have anything I want. Was my bestest friend lying to me?
Good! Now tell him.
Life isn't fair, pal. Get used to it.
No, she won't be, because these comic books are mine!
Yeah, well, now you can spend the rest of your life crying about it. I'm the king!
I love being king.
Hey, SpongeBob!
I need your opinion on something. Do you think the giant flat-screen TV should go over the fancy egg display or the indoor swimming pool?
Back. Back. Okay. Yeah, that's good.  Perfect.
Your front yard?
Uh...
[enraged] Get him! Attack! Attack!  SpongeBob, get him! So I decree. Attack!
[rage takes over] My royal subjects have deserted me. And it's all 'cause of that horrible Squidward. This is all his fault. His, his, not mine, his!
I don't know what you mean.
And what...
Huh?  I thought you were going to say I was abusing my power.
[explodes] Who's saying I'm abusing my POWER!?!  I'll put the whole town in prison!  Questioning my authority is treason! All these kingly speeches are making me thirsty. SpongeBob, I request a drink. SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?! Huh. Gee, everybody's gone. I'm all alone. Fine, I'll get it myself!
Huh?  A knock knock joke!  Who's there?
Aaah, help! Monster! Monster!  Huh? Oh, it's, it's you!  Here, here, take it. I don't want it anymore. It's turned me into a monster.
No. Uh-uh.
Huh?
Hello, SpongeBob.
Huh.
Oh, I heard you. What I didn't hear was a hello.
Hello, SpongeBob. Bloodthirsty bikers! We got to hide!
Hide me!
Hide me!
No, me!
Me!
No! No more running.
Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats  and their leather pants
If we dressed up like that then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads.
Little baby doody-heads?
I wouldn't mess with ya.
See?
Oh.
I'm bloodthirsty. See?  Want some?
What about our biker club?
Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive.
Uhh, SpongeBob?
Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net.
Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky.
Good night, SpongeBob.
I'm all done.
SpongeBob, did you get your net back?
Oh, sorry.  Did you get your net yet?
SpongeBob, I found your net!
Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.
Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?
No.
A present? What is it?
Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!
Um, I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened.
Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out.
I've said too much already.
Ahh! I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear?  You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear?
Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!
I'm in here. Be out in a second.
Hello.
Nothing.
Nothing in my other hand.
Ok, bye.
I would kill for a net like that!
Good morning, SpongeBob.
Eh, nothing.
Bye.
Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?
Nothing. I just finished.  Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here.  Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?
You're acting weird.
OK, bye!  Hello! Who are you?
Oh. No.
What street said that? Was it this one?  Mind your own business!
I don't know who you are, but I'm not giving you this jellyfishing net.  I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar.
You can't have it for any price.
This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's.
SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions.
Why, SpongeBob, why? Why would you wear such a scary mustache?
What?! I'm your best friend!
How could you think that?
Gift.
It's my friend SpongeBob's gift.  I made you a new net.
I'm not your best friend. I'm just a no-good jelly netting thief fish!
I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity.
Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is.
You're giving me Ol' Reliable?  I accept your apology!
I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!
You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net.
Squidward, you look a little different. Wow. Have you been working out?
D'oh, hold it, SpongeBob. Ooh, I know. You shaved your beard.
I broke my net!
For me?
SpongeBob, I broke... could I use this one?
Yeah?
But then you... Uh, what'd you do again?
Don't let those sour notes bring you down.
Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day. Best Friends Day.
This chewing gum is my most beloved possession, and I'm giving it to my bestest friend, on Best Friends Day.
What's wrong, buddy?
Yum. Sweet, hot, and juicy. SpongeBob, this is a great gift.
Aww, don't be so hard on yourself, SpongeBob. I love my gift. In fact, I'll go play with it right now. Come on, Robo.
Oh, SpongeBob, you don't mind if I say good-bye to Gummy, do you?
Thanks. Good-bye, Gummy. You be good to SpongeBob, you hear?  I love you, too, Gummy.  Well, he's all yours.
Hey, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?
What? Is that true?
Well, how do you explain this?
Hmmm. Bold yet understated. Brilliant idea, SpongeBob. Keep up the good work. Come on, Robo, let's find more belly button lint.
SpongeBob, what are you doing? I'm waiting.
Yeah, he does look rather dashing from this angle. Be that as it may, Gummy must be displayed properly and proudly. And I know just the place.  Isn't he breathtaking? All right, SpongeBob, we got to go. I'm gonna learn how to use a fork. Right, Robo?
By the way, your house looks a million times better.
What's this? SpongeBob, what have you done?
It's-it's...it's amazing. It's like a gummy wonderland. Whee! Wow, I wish I were having this much fun. I knew you'd love it.
Enough already. Sheesh. So, you were saying something, SpongeBob?
Aw, just come right out and...  Will you stop? Just stop.
Squidward? Sandy? Gee, everyone is having fun with my Gummy but me. I-I-I mean, your Gummy.
Uh-huh.
Yes!
Oh, that's easy.  I told you it was easy.  Wow! This is the best Best Friends Day ever!
SpongeBob's having a party without me?  Hmph! Throw a party without your best friend? Oh, we'll just see about that.
Oh!
Oh! I had to move my rock out of the dark and into the light.
Thank you, my good man.
Hi, Squidward!
No, Squidward! Don't go out in the dark!  Oh, why won't he listen?
Well, in that case, we'll need even more lights!
Quick! Turn it on, SpongeBob!  More lights!  Now, SpongeBob! More lights!
More lights, SpongeBob! More lights!
Barnacle Boy!?!
Huh? SpongeBob, there's a really big light! I'll go get it, buddy!
Too much light! Too much light!
Huh? What? Huh? No!!  What's making that noise? Hu-huh?  Oh.  It's you again.  Okay, joke's over.  Alright, you got me. Now cut it out.  That's it!  Stop your ringing, mister! I'm warning you. Stop it! I said quit it!  Where's it coming from? Make it stop.  You've got to help me find out where that ringing is coming from.  Hey, come back! Oh, fine. I'll ask someone who cares.  SpongeBob, where's that ringing coming from?  Breakfast!  Come to Patrick!  Tartar sauce. I'm out of food again. All I have is these lousy cans with pictures of food on them. I wanted real food not pictures!  Oh. The food is in the can. Okay, come on out. Come on. Oh, yeah.  Okay, breakfast, get on the plate. Come on. Nice, comfy plate just for you. Come on, get on there. Hello? Anybody in there?  No answer. I'm coming to rescue you.  Having a little trouble reaching you.  You stupid cans.  Oh. Food. Ah, my favorite time of the day. Breakfast and a little morning television.
Oh my gosh.  I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!  I gotta put on my teeth and brush my pants!  Gary?  Pants then flies through the bathroom, coming out with a toothbrush][the toothpaste flies off the toothbrush][Patrick bounces off the side, onto the roof, the bathtub, and out of his rock where SpongeBob is waiting]
Oh, you know, usual.
Hiya, SpongeBob!
Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something.
No. Uhh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?
Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!
Look how big it is, SpongeBob!
Come on!
Wow. How do you think we get inside?
I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on!  Holy seacow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.
Look, I'm winning!
Woo-hoo! Winner! Yeah! High score!
I don't know!  But let's see what this does!
I like rockets.
More! More!
Oh, wait, I think this one starts it.
We've started the rocket!
Hold on, buddy!  Hey, we stopped falling!
Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something!  Hey, SpongeBob, watch this!
Hey, who turned the heavy back on?
All right!
Wow, it sure looks a lot like home.  Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!
So you mean to say they've taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think...
You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.
Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
Wait, what's that?  I think I'm gonna be sick.
Stinky.
Pardon my French but get this thing off me!
It's awake!
Eww, gross.
SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.
Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants.
I didn't even know!
Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's...  ...me that's got me!
I'm waiting.
SpongeBob, what are we waiting for?
I love toys! Can I wait for your toy with you?
There's the mailman!
Hey, SpongeBob, I'm hungry.
Let's go down to the Krusty Krab for a Krabby Patty.
What's wrong SpongeBob?
Oh, I'm gonna take off then. I don't think my arm can stand much more of this.
Hey, buddy.
You missed your surprise birthday party, so I just wanted to bring you a present and some cake because you missed it.
Yeah, see?  Here's a present and your cake.
Yeah. Let me just get you a fork so you can eat it.  Uh, let me just hold the cake like this,  so I can get you a fork.  Huh, I wonder where I put that fork.  Oops.
Oh, yeah.  The fork!
Actually, you've only been here 20 minutes.
No, I don't.
Could you come back later? He's having a moment.
I said he's having a moment! Now leave him alone!
Yup.
SpongeBob?
SpongeBob?
You okay, buddy?
For a sec, I...
I'm sorry. Oh, maybe if you just...
Yeah, how can we thank you?
Hi, SpongeBob! Eww!!!
SpongeBob! What is that?
This!
Scratch it like there's no tomorrow!
Uhh, SpongeBob?
I don't know about this!
This.
Sure do! Well, I gotta go sit in my hole. Catch ya later, pal.
Wow!  Huh? What is this?
Really? How about if I squeeze it like this?  Or this?  Or this?
Sorry. Hey, wanna play a game of pirate wrestling?
I win! I win! I win!
Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick! Go, Patrick!
I've got an idea!
I believe the expression is starfish first.
Hey, SpongeBob, I can see you through this straw.
You're a spy?!  I wanna be a spy, too!!!
Ooh.
That's going to leave a mark.
What's he doing now?
How embarrassing.
What's he doing now?
Can do!
To the spy mobile!
Self destruct!!  There's a call coming through on my Pants-A-Phone.
It's for you.
I think the front door's open.
This looks like a job for Patrick Star Laser Pants!
I am. You need to be quiet. We're on a secret mission.
SpongeBob, I have to go.
My laser pants aren't working right.
No, thank you.
SpongeBob, I have to go now!
Abandon ship!
Not so fast!
Patrick!
I really am Patrick.
Hey, Squidward. Parcheesi?
Thanks, SpongeBob.  If I could reach it, I'd do it myself.
Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob, you gotta see this. It's an emergency broadcast on my TV.
Tomorrow! SpongeBob, we gotta get to bed so we can be first in line!
You ready to ride the Fist O' Pain?
Really? Me too!
Oh, look, the bus is here!
Really, really scary. I mean fun-ifying. I mean horror-tastic. I mean fun-ible! Fun, really, really fun.
Yeah, I can't wait to ride it.
I swallowed my tickets.
Yeah, bad luck. I mean good luck, very good luck.
Oh, I know! Let's go on some of the dumb kiddie rides first.
Phew.
Yeah, only a real baby would be afraid of a roll... Whoa!
Nuh-uh.
How do I look?  Wow, I look great.
That ride's for babies.
I guess that ride was too much for the little guy.
Yeah, it's perfectly safe. No one gets hurt riding these roller coasters.
Yeah!
And I went three times all by myself.
Have fun!
I'm hungry, too.
Want some?
Yeah, that's the problem with this brand. I'll be right back.
It's just a ride. What are you so scared about? You can do it.
Oh, yeah?  I thought we'd settled this the last time!
SpongeBob, I have to tell you something.
Big deal, I did half that stuff this morning.
Yep.
Uh-huh.
After you.
Yeah.
We're not scaredy cats.
Me too.
I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.
Yeah!
Good-bye, SpongeBob.
We survived the Fist o' Pain!
Yeah!
Uh-huh. I came prepared too.  Alright, lets do it.
Plankton says he needs our artistic vision.
I did.  Look, Plankton. It's the perfect height for your kind.
Wait, you wanted to see out the window? Weird.
SpongeBob, how about another game of  tie your best buddy in knots.  My turn.
I've been replaced by a sandwich!  Maybe I could meet a lovely sandwich of my own. Yeah, that'll show SpongeBob.
Could you pass the chips, SpongeBob?
Oh, barnacles! What am I going to do with all this dip?
It's our favorite pastime.
I've never picnicked on a catapult before. Have you, SpongeBob?
Let's do it again.
Can we, Squidward?
Uh, new glasses?
He's probably happy about his new glasses.
Special delivery. For this month's Employee of the Month. I wonder who it could be. As if I didn't know.  No, really. who is it? I don't know.
Oh. SpongeBob?
I want you to pull yourself together, okay? And then I want you to--
Help me spell 'Squidward'.
Thanks, SpongeBob. Party at my house!
He's too proud.
Hey, I want to dance funny, too!
Yeah, what's the big idea?  I don't need this aggravation!  are you still standing here?!
What did I miss?
[he's dressed in a dark green princess outfit and also has on a diaper as he eats his corn dog] What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Want to give me a ruling, SpongeBob?
We're gonna win the trophy.
Ruling, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob?
Whoa.
Like polishing your empty trophy case?
Ok, here I go. Watch me now.  Cramp!
Thanks.
Hey, everybody, let's all do "the cramp"!
No, no!  Yay!
Oh.  Nothing satisfies like a good story.
Get back, I wasn't going to eat all of you!
Sponge--
Well, whatever it is, it's mine! Unless I don't want it!  SpongeBob, what do all these words say?
That's me!
I never thought about anything!
I want to send in a poem, and everyone would love it, and I would be a star!
Hey, look.  I just found $100! It's a sign that I should make my hit record.
It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants. I've learned to trust signs like that.
I wish not to be disturbed, SpongeBob, for I am about to erupt with a masterpiece.
SpongeBob, could I borrow a pencil and some paper and a place to work?
SpongeBob! THIS PENCIL IS BROKEN! Why won't it make words?
I think I wrote a poem once.
Ohh, dodgeballs.
Don't hit me with a dodgeball!
I've never told anyone this, I wrote a poem once.
Wait! There's more. When I read it to the class, they pelted me with dodgeballs! Just because we were playing dodgeball!  Whyyyyyy?!
I'm worried my poem's not gonna be any good and you're going to hit me with dodgeballs.
If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain.
Come on, you stupid brain! work!  It's working!
I'm making art!
That's the creative process at work!  Ready to go to the post office?  I need to mail in my masterpiece.
My song. Ahh...
Um, I don't know. You're not gonna throw dodgeballs at me?
Yeah! And me too! Now sit down and get comfortable.
SpongeBob SquarePants! Are you ready to rock?! Whooo!
You need it louder? Okay!
That was awesome! Did you like it or did you really, really like it? Give me your completely honest opinion of how great it was.
Do you really think so?
Then let's go right now, come on!
I can't wait to see look on their face once they hear this.
Yeah. Did you see his ears?
What record?
Carry me?
Tally ho! Mush! Onward and upward!  Faster, SpongeBob! Faster!  Oh! Hmm-- This record won't stay put.
Good idea.
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
Uh, Bean Dip?
Oh, you mean the angry mob with the pitchforks and torches?
Fan club?  Yee-whoo! We should sing them a song!
And that was my new song called, "Ay..."
Oh, yeah. My song.  Oh, Twinkle, Twinkle, Patrick Star--
Uh-oh.
There, there, SpongeBob. No need to cry.
Two whole days?!
Tejas!
Oh, 47 seconds!  I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles,  the way she plays clarinet, her massive nose.
Is Sandy the one I call Mom?
Wa-hey!
This is gonna taste so good again.
Ow! Ah, Ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah.  Connect the dots.  I drawed a horsey.  Ouch! Why does this flea keep biting me?
I've been bit by a vampire flea!  No!  I'm gonna turn into a vampire now!  It's already happening! Ah, ah!
Augh! Doesn't matter!  Oh, this itch is killing me. Yagh!
Eee!
Wah!
Mraah!
Yeah, good to see ya.
It's gonna be all right.  We will help you.  Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation! All you've brought us is fleas, and trouble and pain and itching and a rash. And pain and fleas and itching and... pain. So... much... pain. So much pain. And as for you.  If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess.
You call this a party? I'm beginning to question  our friendship.
Oh, I've got half a mind, buddy.
You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders.  Uh-huh. Good. Now, I'll get on top of you!  Ah...  Ahhh... Much better.  Whoa!
Wha...? What happened? Where am I!?  Oh yeah, the party! I must've passed out in SpongeBob's kitchen... on the ceiling.  See, SpongeBob, I told you we shouldn't stay up past 8:30. Things get real crazy after 8:30!
Whooooo! Chamomile, chamomile, chamomile! Oh, she really knows how to pound 'em down, huh, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob... SpongeBob? Sponge-  That's a good lookin' donut... Wow...  ...This donut's connected to SpongeBob! Oh...  It worked!  A beautiful specimen of donut-hood. A donut this nice deserves to be served on fine china!  The good plate.  Don't worry, donut. No longer will you suffer the indignity of sub-par dining wear! I don't think I've ever seen a donut this nice before...  Except maybe that donut SpongeBob showed me last night...
This is SpongeBob's delicious...  Wai... I 'ant eat 'is 'onut...!  It's SpongeBob's!
...I hate conflicts!!
And now...  SpongeBob's donut, I ate it!  I've gotta sneak this back into SpongeBob's house before he-  Hello...?
Ah, don't watch that tape..!
Oh, no... that video will show me stealing SpongeBob's donut..! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, eee, eee! I gotta hide this thing.  Whew...  Oh...
Ow, hot, hot, hot, ow!
...The attic!  Wait... I don't have an attic!   Oh... Ooh! I know! the attic.
Ah! H-hey, SpongeBob.
I don't have anything behind my back! So don't look there!
No!  I took it, SpongeBob! I took your donut...! I'm sorry!
You mean...  This is mine?
...When?
Oh... Thanks, buddy!  Hey, Wanna share it?
Yeah, Pretty good, huh?
Are are are are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?
A-a-and these old phone books?
Ol' Reliable?
Patrick sad!
"Why thank you, Sandy, I would love one. [TAKE PATTY.]"  "Too bad SpongeBob isn't here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he'd come home. [TAKE BITE.]"  I can't do it! SpongeBob! Come back!
I miss you! [Cuts to Sandy waving hello, but in guilt  manner because of set-up] Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you!
No! SpongeBob!
If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy! I even picked out this nice jar for you!
I can see you there!  I still see you!  You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob!  I got you now, SpongeBob!
Ok! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy.
Patrick itchy!
A beautiful specimen, SpongeBob.
More like the scrap-heap.  They never come out right! Oh well, let's try again.
I'm ready.
Oh, I missed it again! This darn camera isn't fast enough.
It's not?
It Is?
Like presents on Christmas Day, it doesn't seem to stay. Or a cheese souffl, it doesn't last all day.
...All day.  Um, SpongeBob?
I hope it doesn't break until we get a little closer to the ground.
No!  What happened?
Whoa, what is it? It looks really old.
Antis, Antis...SquarePantis! Probably belonged to your ancient ancestors.  SpongeBob SquarePantis, you must wear the ancient crest of your ancestors for it is your birth right!
This is the most beautiful bubble I've ever seen.
What's it doing?
I'm Patrick, I'm Patrick, Patrick-Patrick-Patrick! And I like um, uuuuh,  I don't know what I like.
SpongeBob, when are we gonna see the bubble?
Where'd SpongeBob go?
Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'm coming to help you!
Like a delicate air raisin!
Oh golly! Oh, I don't know how much longer I can hold this!
Yeah! We almost popped the most prized possession of all Atlanteans!
Ooh! Let's get a picture for our scrapbooks before leave.
I thought I heard a popping sound?
We destroyed your most prized possession!
Plankton's wrath tastes like ice cream.
But Atlantis had the oldest bubble which I cruelly destroyed!
We sure did!
Me too!
Hey, buddy.
Oh, sorry, SpongeBob. I just came over to borrow some jelly.
I have a solution.
Ah. I have solved my hunger problem.
We're here. Hey, what did I bring jelly for?
Oh, yeah. I was gonna put it on this peanut butter taco.
SpongeBob, get out of my taco!  What's the matter, SpongeBob?
I don't know.  What's happening to me?
Give me!
Oh, yeah, I can pay for it.
What's that?
I don't have any money.
Oh, I'm payin' for it all right.
Huh?
No problem. Tra-la-la-la-la.  Work, work, work, work.
I accidentally tried the hand soap.  It doesn't taste as good as it smells.
How do I do that?
Uh... I have to be very gentle.
Almost done, Mr. Krabs.
Yup.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
I have to get rid of this trash, but it won't go down.
SpongeBob, you're a genius!  Oh, no, there's one left.
Why won't you go down?
Can I eat now?
Hi, SpongeBob. Hey, cool glasses. Can I try them on... oh!  SpongeBob, your eye. It's all black and swollen. How'd you mess your eye up, SpongeBob? Did somebody hit you? Where is he? Yeah, we'll settle this like men. We'll sue him.
Are you sure, SpongeBob? Who was this guy, anyway?
Oh.
What did you do?
With tears?
Then what happened?
I know exactly what you mean. You whooped him with your eyes closed.
There goes a real hero.
Hey, SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!  You forgot to tell me you're leaving!
I'm gonna miss you, buddy!
Well, see you later, bud.
Summer camp? But I'm not even ready yet!
Yep!
Weee! Haha!
Actually, I am a little hungry.
The food coma is setting in.
I had no idea that they had a hot tub!
Not bad! Except for this aftertaste.
Yeah!
What's wrong, SpongeBob?
If only we could think of some sort group activity that we can all do together, then we would all be having the same amount of fun as each other.  Good night!
I... I like the other island better!
SpongeBob and I are being chased by a savage beast!
Can we come?!
What so?
Weird. There's a door back here too?
And a nice fire to keep us warm.
Gotcha.
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no. You made the last decision. It's my turn.
Um...maybe,...uh...
Oh for crying out loud SpongeBob, I didn't rush you when it was your turn!
Uhhh..  Oh shoot! I forgot what I was going to say!
Do you wanna go play hide and go-seek?
Aahh, good times.
Are you kidding? That old coot's been here for years! Look at him: he's in great shape! Look at his muscular arms, his rock-hard abs, and a great complexion, why, he's glowing with health.
I don't know about you, but I've got all the comforts of home right here.
Hey SpongeBob.
Oh, boy am I! I'm ssoooooo hungry, I could eat anything! I could eat an entire sponge...
...cake. I was just going to share my golden sponge cake with him. It has delicious cream filling too!
Something smells good. What are you cooking SpongeBob?
Why do you want to eat me?
Well not if I eat you first!
You seemed kinda tense, so I drew you a hot bath.
Oops, I forgot the bathbeads!
I was not! It was supposed to be stew!  Whew! I'm getting tired.
This isn't a bed!
Give me that ketchup back!
No, got you!
What?
Why do you care if we're survivalists?
Me too.
Beware! Let it be known to all far and wide, The mollusks are coming! Tally, ho!  The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! The mollusks are coming! THE MOLLUSKS ARE COMING!
Mollusks? What mollusks?
No. I was only pretending to be my famous, Great-Great-Great Uncle, Patrick Revere! He rode through the streets warning Bikini Bottom of the coming hordes of ravenous, man-eating mollusks!
It's too bad nobody listened to him.
Well the best part about it is, I don't have to accomplish anything in life, because my Uncle already did it for me. Really takes the old pressure off.
Oh, well then it's lucky you have me as a famous friend. Or your life would be a hollow shell.
Another year older.
It's Patrick!
SpongeBob doesn't like me anymore!
Opposite Day? Hey, I've heard of that!
No! What is it?
Oh! Let me try! Let me try!
Meow.
Pu evig i.
Nope.
Isn't it beautiful?
Hey! I wanna be opposite too!  Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo!  I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
OK.  I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward.
Thank you!
...Go!
Robert, Robert...uhh...Ronald, Ronald, Ryan.
Oh, wait I got it. Ringo...
Hello?
I wonder if I can order pizza with these things.
SpongeBob, you're gonna need to speak up. My eardrums aren't what they used to be.
Oops.
I don't know, buddy!
Ok.
I think I landed on a rock. [Patrick shows a big rock on the back of his head]
That's just Squidward sunbathing again.
What is it?
We?
I'll say.
Yeah, dark.
Now hold it, SpongeBob. You better let me drive.
No! Let go! I wanna drive!
Or even around the block!
You said "Bye, Squidward" twice.
Now what?
Yeah?
No, but I see a sign. It says. "Warning: Ab...eyes?"
Oh, OK. What's an abyss, SpongeBob?
And now we're being bathed in an eerie red light!
[the submarine loses its bolts and breaks in the water] And now a deafening warning siren!
Order... uh... up!
[the Chum Charges explode around the submarine] SpongeBob! Our hull's been breached. Do you know what that means?
[a close up to SpongeBob & Patrick] Neither do I!
SpongeBob, look!
It's a liquid.
And paper.
Where's your best friend now, SpongeBob?
How about now?
You...found a new best friend?
Noooo!!!! You're not my best friend!!!
You mean like those guys?
Yeah, look at this guy.
Well, duh, SpongeBob. It's only the most significant event in Bikini Bottom history! Long time ago, the town was divided into 2 groups  Those who spent their time washing their hands like softies
And those who had more important matters with their time
And that's how we won our right to wash as we please.
Never have, never will.
Does that bother you, huh, SpongeBob?  They only had one ice cream cone.
Oh, wait. You've got something on your tongue.
Here, I'll get it.
Well, I guess we can't be friends.
Ugh, do I have to spell it out for you?  U...R... huh... How do you spell "not my friend"?
No, thank you.  I happen to like my various smells and germs.
Well, says you. I like dirty.
Dirty!
Fine, me too!
Hey, give it back!
Yeah, well  I got your eyeballs!
Do you give up yet, SpongeBob?
Your pants are falling down.
I'll fix it.
There, you look good now.
Why, what's wrong with them?
No! Not a pedicure!!  No, not that, anything but tha-- Nail Polish?!  You sick little monster, face my morning breath!!!
Who, me? My teeth are fine, see?
Minty fresh! Taste pit, evildoer!!
No, not...not deodorant
My beautiful pit stink, it's gone! The gloves are off now.  It's booger time!
Oh, yeah?
Ha! I got you now!
Raw onions?!!  That does it!!  See this?
Oh, I'm not going to eat it.
That's right, your precious patties on my stinky feet!
Stinky, little feet
Hoppin'...  ..CLAAAAMS!!!  Hey, I got my filth back!
No, not soap! You wouldn't dare!
Stay back, I'll do it!
My beautiful filth! It's gone! I'm squeaky clean!!
Man! To get my filth back, I'll have to wallow in mud forever!
Slather toe jam on my armpits?
Smear slime on my teeth?
And since I'm clean, I can get even filthier! Thanks, SpongeBob!
Squeaky clean, squeaky, squeaky
Hi, SpongeBob.
Well, it was great until you showed up.
Oh, just a birthday cake for my mom that I spent all day baking. (Deleted) I'm gonna go back and make a 2nd b-day cake that my mom will like. Idiot Boy!
I don't know. I've been knocking on his door for three hours. I need his hot sauce for my milkshake.
What am I gonna do without my best friend? I should never have been mean to you!
SpongeBob!
Buddy? You there?
SpongeBob!
Huh? SpongeBob!  Oh, I knew I'd find you, buddy! Look at you. You haven't changed a bit. Let's go home and eat a gallon of seanut butter.
I'll get ya out of this cage, buddy!  You're safe now in my arms.  Huh? Where'd you go now?
Oh.
You may not remember the weasel but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you?
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, Krabby Patty! [he eats the Krabby Patty] SpongeBob, another masterpiece.
Oh, wait a minute! SpongeBob, you already do work in a fast food restaurant!
We're not just neighbors.
We're not just...
Hey guys!
You bet! Now, where do you want these extra buns?
Oops.
Thank you, come again!  Can I help whoever's next, please?  What's the password, please?
That's it!  Come right in!
What's the pas-  Nope, that's not it!
Looking for your calling, huh?  Hmmm... So, what are you good at?
Nothing at all?
Interesting. Let's see how good you are at nothing.
Come with me. First, sit down on this chair. Clear your mind. Empty it off all thoughts... until you're doing... absolutely... nothing.
You're not worthy for instruction in the immobile arts. Leave my presence!
Good-bye! Not a word!
Who's Nick? Sorry Squidward. I couldn't wait any longer, I've gotta use your toilet. No questions! Thanks.  Phew! I wouldn't go in there for a couple days. Or weeks.
Oh, hey Squidward, if you see SpongeBob, can you give him his brain back? I was borrowing it for the weekend. I'll just set it here.  See ya!
SpongeBob, SpongeBob!
Me too! Me too!
I found out where boogers come from
Uh-huh. What's your news?
All right! I play a mean belly.
Yeah?
Go ahead, say it, SpongeBob!
Perhaps you didn't notice My new hairdo.
And unlike your nasty, little wig  Mine is real!
Natural talent, watch this
Hey, check this one out.
I'm on it.
Can I get mine in pink?  It looks like a tattoo!
I once searched for my innermost secrets. All I found was this.
Yeah!
All right!
Ohh. Nice kitty.  Here, kitty. Want a sausage? A nice, delicious, tasty...... sausage.  Spawn of a gefilte fish!
What? Oh, oh it's you. Hey, how's it going buddy?
Don't worry, I'm all ready doing it. (Patrick is eating a sausage)
Yeah, thanks buddy! You really saved my behind! No joke!
Uhh... I don't know.  I'm funny.
SpongeBob...
I think, I broke my bottom.
Yeah!  Ah. Much better.
I can't see a doctor. My job doesn't provide me with health insurance.
Exactly.
Hey, I broke my butt.
Did what?
What happened to you?
Whatever that means. Hey, SpongeBob, what do you say we charge into Jellyfish Fields nets a-blaze?
Let's do this...  Ya-ha! Hey, your turn.
Hey, listen...when you decide to do something fun you know where to find me.
Look at my tongue.
Huh, I don't think you have what it takes.
It won't be easy but I'll do it.
But first, I'll need a garden hose and a flatbed truck and I'll need you to remove your trousers.
Try to concentrate on your first lesson in weird.  See you on the other side, buddy!
SpongeBob, the weird therapy is working. Your craters are coming back. We just have to keep pushing the boundaries. We've gotta get stranger.  Talk backwards.
What's happening? The final transformation.
What happened?
No!!
Go away.
We're in mourning.
SpongeBob, you're back to your square shape.
Yeah. Everyone needs at least one day away from...
Big deal. Wait till you see "No Patrick Day"? Come on, everyone. Lets go!  Where'd everybody go? Hello? Hello?
Yeah?
Mm-hmm. I see. Well, I'm pretty booked today, but I think I can fit you in.
No problem.
You called the right person, Mr. SpongeBob.  Now, let's see where the problem's at.  Hmmm... interesting.
Hmmm... interesting.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you were a doctor. Hmph!
Oh, but I'm sure you can figure it out with your 12 years of med school.
So?
Oh, no, no, it looks like you have things under control.
Okay. But we play by  rules, SquareBob.  Well, here's your problem. Don't you worry, buddy.  We're gonna make it go away.
There appears to be a little bit of swelling.  This garbage compress should help that go down.  That doesn't look good.  Yeah, but my shift is over.  Call me in the morning... if you can still dial the phone.
Thanks buddy!
Probably not.
He's only a block away.
You said it buddy.
How do we do that?
But what's that have...
Living like Larry. Living like Larry.  This is bogus!
SpongeBob, these are the best years of our lives, and you want to waste them blowing bubbles? We should be living in the moment! We should be living like Lar...  This is it SpongeBob! This is where we redeem are miserable lives! It's time to start...  ...  Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob?
Where were you SpongeBob? That was awesome!
To live my friend! We are going to live!  This is going to be the best fun yet!
You must defeat your reason, before you can start...  ...living like Larry!  Wo-hoo! SpongeBob, this is it!
Come on SpongeBob! What are you waiting for? Let's go!
Just you wait! it's the ultimate!  What do you think? And wait 'till you see the best part!  Hey you guys.
Here's to living like Larry!
Don't you mean, cost us our lives SpongeBob?
I see. And that's your final word on the subject?
I feel sorry for you.
SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!  You were right SpongeBob! I went too far! I went too far!
Uh-uh.
Are you sure about this SpongeBob?
I don't know SpongeBob, this looks pretty dangerous.
Uh oh!
No, I just didn't want to get it all wrinkled up. Last one in is a rotten egg!
His mother must be so proud.
We did put on a few extra coats of sun screen today.
We've gotta look our best.
Me first! Me first!
Like one of those hip young old folks on a soda commercial.
Got 'ya, 15 seconds, it'll take a few minutes.
What? Did somebody say something?
What?
Afraid so. Bye girls.
Oh, it's you. You don't look too good.
See for yourself.
Ew, what are you gonna do?
Hey, that's quitter talk Mr.! You're going to that party tonight! What you need, is a makeover!  A little Kelp Jerky? Open wide.  What do you think?
Well, hey buddy, look like you could use an ice cream.
One caramel sundae please.
Can't talk, working.
Take a look.
What?
Oh, sure thing pal. Hey everybody make some room! The floor's all yours. Knock 'em dead kid.
Whatever. I just gooooo with the flow.
They're pretty.
Okay, Okay, jeez. Try to help a fella out. I'll just have to eat this ice cream cone instead.
Yeah.
Boy I do! Thanks Squidward. Want some SpongeBob? Last one to the cone is a rotten clam!
All done.
Here you go SpongeBob.
Do you want your grow juice back?
Okay.
But you said you didn't want it.
Yeah, I'll go first.
Quite an improvement, don't you think?
Yay!
Get ready.
You're a saint, SpongeBob! A saint!
Oh, I got one! You know that thing?
No, the other one.
Yeah, you'd be ugly again.
What, if you turn the bottle upside down, maybe it'll shrink it.
Try it again.
Well, now his body is too small.
Arms are too short.  Legs are too short.  Other arm.  Feet too small.  Teeth!  Belly button.  Perfect!
I know! I know! Um, made you a monster!
Yeah! Yeah! You chase us!
I know. We should do this...  ...more often.
Yeah! Squidward, tell them about all those times that you didn't punch me in the face.
So?
Of course I have a nose, Squidward. Why, it's as plain as the nose on my...  ...face?  You're right, Squidward!
You do?
Give me! Give it here!
There!  Well SpongeBob, what do you think of my new nose?
I guess I'll always be a noseless freak.
Yeah, but all my friends have noses. You, Squidward, Sandy, even Mr. Krabs!
I can do that?
Sorry doc, but I don't really think it's me.
Okay! Let's see. Hmm
Wait, stop, careful SpongeBob! This fragile stitching requires tender care. Allow me to carefully remove the bandages.
I will! Now, how do I use this thing?  What is that smell?  Pastries? I never knew they smelled so good!
All these years I knew I was missing out on something, but I never thought smelling could be this good!  What is that horrible smell?  Onion rings?  The scent! Nobody told me about bad smells!  What is it now?  I'm going to have to re-think this whole smelling thing.  I made it. At least here at home, I can't be attacked by those wretched odors.  Bad smells are all around me!  I can not live in these conditions!
The smells! They're everywhere! It's unbearable!
There's another one! No! I can't take it!
To do what should have been done long ago. [delost?] Sweet Neptune, imported cheese!  This is in-excusable!  Yuck!
It's rotten garbage now.  That's better.
You are sick, Squidward!  There's that smell again!
You!
Oh, I'll help you all right! Help stop you polluting are world with your sweaty holes.  There.
Well you can't go to work smelling like that. You should be thanking me, SpongeBob.  Smell's like, something greasy!  Nobody move! I am ridding this place of it's disgusting stench, with these scented candles!
This air freshener should finish the job.
Well good! No one should have to eat in this stench!
Say no more, you can thank me later. Right now, I've got plenty more stink holes to swab clean.
Take a bath, fleabag!
Hello.  No!  All I wanted was to be able to smell like the rest of you.
I heard that!
Hi, SpongeBob.
With what?
Here you go, buddy.
What?
Find out!
Good one!
Good question.
I can't believe it! It was Squidward!
You know what to do.
But we hear-ed what you've done.
Oh, I'm not taking a bus SpongeBob. I am watching this pole. So the next time it moves, I will see it!
Hey guys. Could you fix me and the wife up a couple of Krabby Patties?
What's up?
Ok.
Hey, SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Yeah. You and Gary don't have a chance.
Now, what am I gonna do? I'm all alone behind this rope!
You don't understand, SpongeBob! You'll never understand what it's like to be alone behind the red rope!
Woof, woof!
I'd love to!
Uh, I can't quite see it from here. I'll just have to climb on board.
Almost up!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Eeeeeeee!
What'd she say?
Om.
You bet!
Wow.
Will there be nachos there?
Look!
Plus, we wanna talk to you.
Uh...
I kinda like staring at him.
Not since I saw my first triple-layer cheese cake.
Look! He's on top of that big... drinking fountain!
Increased chance of precipitation?
Hey, that's what they used to call me!
This wind feels like broken glass mixed with razor blades!
No!!
Hey, I was gonna eat that!
Time for those lessons to pay off!
Now what are we gonna do?
I love this song!
Sorry, SpongeBob. That wasnt me.
So did I, SpongeBob, but I was just mimicking it.
Well, the last time I remember coughing like that, I was sitting at home eating a box of Kelp Jerky.
I got the TV remote stuck in my throat!
SpongeBob, what are you doing?
No! You always give a choking victim the Slimelich Maneuver, first! And if that doesnt work, you walk away and pretend like you never saw them before.  Like this! Ready, clam?
Well, SpongeBob, I think I might go catch a movie.
What clam? Ive never seen that clam before in my life.
Thats not a baby, SpongeBob.
Ill give you a hint: whats white, round, and comes out of clams?
No, silly! A volleyball!
Thats my specialty.
No, being called Patrick.
Good idea!
Having good ideas?
Well, just dont take too long. We were just about to start playing with it.
What do you mean, small fortune?
Huh? Oh, I dont know. I am getting kinda hungry, though. Ill catch up with you later, SpongeBob.
The last of what?
So, did you figure out what youre gonna do with this fat stack of cabbage, yet?
Well, my dad always told me: when you have money, you need to do more than just spend it. You need to have a plan.
Well, what he said was, How many times do I have to tell you not to stand there? But I knew what he meant.
You do?
You can say that again!
Really?
Yup!
A lifetime supply of strawberry gum!
Ice cream?
UhIm here to see SpongeBob.
Well, I dont think so. Normally, I
Good day. Uh, your shoes untied.
Uh, hey guys. Have you seen SpongeBob around?
SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
SpongeBob, I gotta tell you something I think you should know: your house is full of strangers!
SpongeBob, if you keep throwing your money away like that, you wont have any left to
SpongeBob!
But
Oh, hey SpongeBob.
Oh, the same thing us sea stars are usually doing, I guess. Laying up against a rock.
About what?
There is no right or wrong when it comes to that stuff, SpongeBob. There just either is or there isnt.
Well, why didnt you say so, buddy? Ive been waiting for someone to go break in my new volleyball with!
Yup, I found it!
Inside the Bikini Bottom Diamond Mine!
I don't know. What do you think it is?
And hairy.
Is it time to look yet?
No, you peek first.
Pretending?
Can we wear costumes?
Hey, SpongeBob, how do I look?
I can even do it in my sleep.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
And to pretend wrestle.
Dark?! I'm afraid of the dark.
Oh, right, it's just those guys we're gonna wrestle.  Hello, fellow competitors.
What was that?
I don't get it.
Oh, hey, SpongeBob.
A fist? Where?  Oh, yeah, that's definitely a...
It was so super duper fun.
With pleasure.
Hey, good one, SpongeBob.
Okay.  And if you think this is bad, wait till I get my hands on ya.  I'm gonna, uh... I'm gonna... tear ya to shreds! Like a...  C'mon! Ah! I got a paper cut! Paper cut!
Huh? Oh, I'm fine. I just like to suck on my hand.
Good catch!
Helicopter.
1 and 2 and squeeze.
Squeeze.
Squeeze.
One, two, three, four...
No, I'm thinking about buying this book on counting. Three, four. What's gonna happen next? FIVE? Holy super-happy-fun-time! This book's good! I'll take it! One, two, three...
Seventeen...
Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred! Oh! I hate counting! Just give me what he's having! Oh, boy! Let's see which card I got! Is this a good card, SpongeBob?
It sure does the job, all right.
I'm preventing gingivitis.
Yes, sir.
Okay. Thanks, buddy.
Ha, ha. SpongeBob fly.
What?
SpongeBob, you can't always expect my usual brand of stupidity. I like to mix it up. Keep you on your toes.
Good job, SpongeBob. Now let me just get my keys.  Nope.  There you are. I knew you were in there somewhere.
Sheesh. Don't get your pants up in a square knot, SpongeBob. I don't even believe in pockets. I keep everything I need right here. In the folds of my back fat.  You seem to be pretty fond of this little thing. Why don't you just keep it?
I'd give you my most valuable possession?
I'm the best pal ever. But can you do me one favor?
Do you mind if I hold on to it? Just for today?
Well, good. 'Cause my landlord changed the lock again.
Oh! I don't need any old locksmith.
Ugh!  Man, this card is fantastic!  Breaking and entering sure makes a fella hungry. Hey, why don't we eat some dinner? And then I'll give you your card.  Ew! This barbecue's really filthy. Oh, but this'll take care of it.
Now, now, SpongeBob I know you wanna help, but you're my guest.  There! Nice and shiny!
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll take care of it. There! Good as new!
Dinner is served.
Oh! Pardon me! That hit the spot!  Hey! Look at that!  Sundown already? Well, you can have your card now. I hope you get as much use out of it as I have.
SpongeBob, what's wrong?
Aw... sure you will.
Well, how about these?
Well, that pack I bought was full of 'em.
They're all yours, buddy. See ya tomorrow.
Oh! Hey, SpongeBob? Can I borrow one of those cards?  I locked myself out of my house again.
Oh, boy! We're gonna get our books signed and then we're gonna meet Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and then we're gonna shake their hands and then they're gonna sign our books!
What do you mean?
Oh, well, can't you just skip a day? Just call in sick. Always works for Squidward.
Okay. Hmm... oh, I know! What are those things you use when... after you eat, you need to take a...
That's the one! Why don't you take a bathroom break tomorrow, sneak out the window, get your book signed, and sneak back into class! It wouldn't take long at all!
Oh! There's always the catch.  I need brain fuel! Ah! SpongeBob, how am I gonna feed my brain when all you have is your fancy bubbly water? Well, it'll have to do.
sary? Yes, it is!
Yeah?
Uh-huh.  Why?
What?
SpongeBob, look!  Let's go catch it!
This is a shortcut.
Pretty cool, huh?
I didn't do it. They did.  They're friendly.
Ice cream!
Yeah, four scoops.
Oh, don't be such a sourpuss.  Here, I'll buy you a cone.
Hooray!
Way to go!
Nah. I found the institution had nothing of to offer me. I was stagnating.
Hold on.
Found Squidward.
Well, at least you still have the hat.
You still have your underwear.
Yeah. Not his fault.
Was it my fault?
Thanks, SpongeBob. And it wasn't your fault either.
Uh...maybe it's your fault.
Ever!
Dog-pile on Squidward!
Hey.
Secret!
We don't use our pinkies.
I don't think Squidward wants to join our lodge.
Initiation.
After you, Brother SpongeBob.
Brother SpongeBob.  Aaahhhh!  Brother Squidward.
Yeah. Those Feather Buddies better hope they don't run into us in a dark alley.
Hm. It's genius. But, I see one flaw in your plan.
That sock is way too small.
That's what I'm talkin' about!
Roooo!
Roo!
It works!
But you'll have to pass the initiation again.
Only once. To take back some stuff I borrowed.
Borrow something, and he'll have to come over to get it back.  Uhh!  Well... hey, thanks for lettin' me play puzzle with you. See ya later!
You just missed the fire.
Hello. Uh, may I speak with SpongeBob, uh, uh...  ...Squaaa...re...Paaaaants?
Hey, hey. You want to hear how long I can do this for?
No.
A pretty long time. Huh?
Do I know you?
SpongeBob?  No, you're not! SpongeBob has square pants. Now, leave me alone, you mysterious stranger.
Hello. Can I help you?
Oh, right. You're that round pants fellow.
Your house? This house belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants. At least it did before he left us.  I wish I could see him one last time.
Yeah...wake up!
Wow!  can you beat me up next?
Wow! That Mermerang really likes you!
You never brought me flowers.
Really?
Certified!
Yay!
Heroes! Heroes! Hero...  ...oes.
And Pat Boy!
Got what?
Well duh!
Everything! It's even fun just to say the word! Shee-uf-fle-boarde!
We are seriously going to kick some elderly buns today! Huh SpongeBob?
Out of the way gramps! That's my trophy old lady!  It's going to be and action packed thrill ride of geriatric proportions! And the best part is, there is no way we can lose with these costumes on!
Oh... ya, I forgot.  Well how come I didn't get a trophy?!
Oh ya, I forgot. Well Let's go do something else.
For Neptune's sake SpongeBob, if we're not going to go around town pretending to be Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, then who is?!
Exactly. And with no one patrolling the town, who's gonna stop those youngsters from loitering?
No! We are! Let's take 'em to the slammer!
Too harsh?  Explain.
You're chewing too loud!
You're too old!
You handle Man Ray, I'll take care of his lackey.
Ohhhh!
You too missy.
And then some.
Oh, a, oh, actually, I think he was about to say Squid...
I'll say.
It was. I traded with SpongeBob.
No way! He's making that up! It was him!
You better tell him, SpongeBob.
Actually, that time, it really was me.
Uh-uh.
Well, I was just saying that these lines you drew remind me of a railroad track.
Well, actually, there  a railroad convention in town last week, and I bought myself this nifty conductor's cap.
Well, I don't know. Suits my needs.
Yes.
I see that now. There's never been any choice for me.
Yeah, we're sorry, Squidward.
G-7? King me! King me!  I lose!
Tartar sauce!
Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's...
We could toss that shell back and forth.
Go!
There it is!
Bonus points!
Don't worry. I know how to do this.
What are you worried about?  He looks better already.
Well, let's go put him in the warm.
You know, you worry too much.  The Patrick is here and SpongeBob I know a lot about head injuries, believe...  ...me. Hey, what's that on your shoe?
It kind of looks like...
Yeah-yeah, that's it, uh-huh.
It's working, it's working...
Look!
Oh, I thought he was dead.
Don't, don't hurt us!
Oh yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Please don't haunt us!
I think they make a cream for that now.
One watermelon fresh from the manure field, your spookiness.
What do you hunger for, master?
I found it.
I found it.
Yes, your ghostliness!  This is fun.
Yes.
Yes.
Where?
Oh, coming!  How are we going to clean up all this mess?
Oh look, you missed some.
We're going to go shopping?
Boy, he really had us fooled.
You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.
That again?
No, the other thing.
No, what you said before when you..
Never mind! I've got an idea.
Blow harder.  There he goes!
How high's he going to go?
Happy trails!
Yeah.  He's in a better place.
Okay SpongeBob! It's your turn! I'm ready!
Nice landing!  Darn, I missed! SpongeBob, look out for my body!
Okay.
Ball! Let me see it!  What a weird ball.
There's nothing to be afraid of SpongeBob. It's just a little worm. See?
Looks like he's taking a fancy to you.
That sounds delightful!
Something tells me they don't like each other.
SpongeBob, I gotta get going. See you later now.
SpongeBob, something tells me that Mr. Wormsley is actually a  Wormsley.
That it is.
Yeah! wait 'till.
Maybe you could take care of them.
Who're you talking to, buddy?
Sorry to disturb you during work hours. I just wanted to remind you about my birthday.
Then why aren't you saying the words?
"Happy birthday"! It's today! My birthday's today!  Well, you surely must remember what you're gonna bring to my birthday, right?
My birthday cake! You're supposed to bring my birthday cake!
Yes, tonight! Well, when else am I gonna celebrate it? At least I had the courtesy to start the party after my best friend got off of work. See ya tonight, buddy
I was just buying some birthday hats for my birthday party.  You didn't forget my party, did you?
You're already forgetting one thing!
Hello!?! My birthday cake!
You finally made it!
Well, just leave my present over on the present table!
I'm so excited, I've been waiting for a whole year!
Well, what're you waiting for, buddy? Serve up the cake so I can tear into that present!
You took it to Sandy's?
SpongeBob, why are your clothes invisible?
No, no, you can't borrow my birthday present!
No, not till you deliver my birthday cake.
Hold on, where're you going?
Yeah, I'd like to know also! What kind of a birthday present is this?
We could've worked something out.
I'm waiting for you, so we can play the day away.  Oh, barnacles! You're wearing that dumb hat, again! Every time you wear that stupid thing, you're, you're gone for the whole day!
Why don't you just take it off so you don't have to go to work today?
Ugh! I hate that hat!  Fine, have it your way, hat!  Hmph. Looks like Squidward has time to play. Hey, Squidward!
Oh no! He's got the hat, too!
I'll show you, SpongeBob! I'll get a job and a hat!
Standin' around out here all day.
Oh boy, gimme my hat!
Sounds complicated, but if it gets me a work hat.  How's this?
Okay.
Any thing for my new hat.
I did it! Did you see that Mr. Krabs?
Do I get my hat now?
Yeah! Wheeee!
Sometimes when I'm nervous, I forget how to stand!
I did?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
You got it, Mr. K!
I like pie.
I feel like a million BUCKS...
No! P-please, don't tell Mr. Krabs! You don't understand. For years people have been telling me, You're no good! Now I'm good! I have a hat to prove it! I don't wanna go back to being No Hat Patrick!
What's that, pal?
Thanks pal.
Hi, SpongeBob.
Hey, good idea. Hey, Squidward, could you hold me hat so it won't get hurt?  Thanks buddy.
Ready!
I'm trying!
Argh, I think I'm stuck!
I dunno, Mr. Krabs.
Uh huh.
Hey, Squidward, d'you think you could, uh, you know 
Thanks, Squidward! Oh, my hat. Gotcha! All right, back where you beloooong, aaaah! .
Look, Squidward, I'm falling!
I figured it out; it's the hat that makes me fall, it makes me top heavy!
You're giving me a raise.
Well, I guess it's back to being to no hat pat!
Really?
Thanks, SpongeBob! You're the best!
Yeah?
I don't know.
No.
Nah.
Hm.....nope. No. Nope. Nope. Uh-uh. No. Nah.
Uh-uh.
Yeah, that'll happen.
There's gotta be something we can do.
We hadn't thought of that one.
Ugh. I'm so bored. There's gotta be something we can do!
Almost there!
Here it is!
Ohhhhh!
But where's the toy store?
Not...open?
We wanted to go to the toy store but it's not open yet.
Mm-hm.
Uh, no thanks. I'm good down here.
Wow.
Hey, SpongeBob. whats with the tutu?
Uh-huh.
Never!
What part of "never" don't you understand?
Huh! I'm not moving.
Not if we hide.
Oh, it's sneaky alright. Really sneaky. C'mon, haven't you always wanted to have a toy store all to yourself?
We need to find a hiding spot where they'll never find us. And I know just the place.
The coast is clear.
Push, SpongeBob! Push! Push, man, push!  Okay, SpongeBob gimmie your hand. That's my boy. Brace yourself.
Yay! Oh, this is so awesome.
What?
I can't hear you! It's too dark in here! Don't worry. I'll just use my Night Vision.
Yeah.
Remember that flashlight I shoved up my ear?
Well, I guess it worked its way into my brain. Shoot! The batteries are dead! It's dark... and scary!
Yeah. Right, SpongeBob. I let you down, we find the light switch, and everything turns all peachy!
Look around you, SpongeBob! We're surrounded!
That...want...to...get us.
Are we gonna hide in here for the rest of our lives?
Are we going to the ladies's room again?
That was fun! Now let's dress up like fairy princesses! .
Let's get some!
I know. I'm an interesting guy.
What?
With Neptune as my witness, may you never experience the unholy terrors that are inside that store. Hey, they're open!  I love toys!
Time for what?
No, besides, I don't really think my shins should be involved. They're a bit flabby today.
The beach! Just you and me!?  So am I ready for the beach SpongeBob?
I knew it! We've been abandoned!
Small plastic disc that you throw!!!  I love to play... small plastic disc that you throw!
Ohhh...hmmm... How about small plastic disc that you toss!?
Ha ha ha ha.
I caught it!  Wasn't that cool, SpongeBob?
Like what?
Well, I don't know. Playing with the sand sounds pretty boring.
Boring, SpongeBob, boring!
That sounds  un-boring!"
Everything's dandy in Patrick's Kingdom.
Whoa! What are you doing!? You destroyed my castle!
Well, I don't need any help.
Why thank you. Here's a little something for you."
Now, we're even!
Now this'll show SpongeBob that he's not the only one who can build a castle! Let's see SpongeBob destroy this castle!
So?
You tyrant! You've done it again! I'll show you what for!
Now we're even... again!
This treaty isn't worth the sand it's printed on!
No way! You started it.
Whatever.  No no no no no.  Oh hello! And goodbye.
You'll never win! Do you hear me!?
I like you this much!  Feel me!
The question is... will you be!?  No fair!
Oh ya! Two can play at this game!
I wasn't going to do this, but you've left me no choice.
Ohhhh. What happened?
Me too...was it worth it?
I bet I can clean up faster than you!
Yes, I can!
Oh, I can!
Hey, look at this!
CHUM IS... ME...
...META...A...TAB...TAB...AB...BOL...IC...
...METAB...BO...
It's kelp juice, you want some? . HEY! What kind of friend are you?
Go ahead. Say you're sorry.
Okay, I forgive you. And... I'm sorry for yelling. Okay, so can I tell you something honestly?
It's about your sign. These words make my head sad.
It's okay little fella I don't either.
Uhh, what's that number before one?
Oh right, congratulations, you have zero customers!
Wait, what are we doing again?  There we go! Chum is Fun!
They seem to think it's interesting.
Huh?
Hm, huh?
OOH I like that one!
You got it boss!
Huh?!
Hmmmm, Mhmmmm, Uh huuuh. I think I see the problem. Your potty has a shocky thing in it.
Oh... Gotcha. Hmmmmmm.
Thanks boss.
Excuse me sir.  My resignation.
I know but I'm "burned out." See? Anyway, you can send my check to my home.
You got it boss!
Yes, sir.  Who are you? And Who are you working for?!
A high school diploma?
Here it is.
Hey, there's my house.
Well, duh. I don't want to miss my shows.
Pointing to a screen
Nice.
Neighbor hug!
Oh! Hey, maybe we can use this.  I borrowed it from Sandy's treedome. It might be our way outta here. Shh! Everybody quiet! Hey, Sandy, I got your radio! If you want it back, come and get it! She'll come.
Sandy's trapped in that box!  Sandy?
I'm freaking out!
Oh!
Hmm. You guys ready to give up?
And I'll just write my... myself down here for... forgiving up, too. Uh, SpongeBob?
Ooh! I know. Uh, let's just say are tearful farewells and solemn last words, huh?
I didn't get to sleep in  this morning.
Through the freezer?
Owie!
Owie!
Owie!
What now?
Hey, SpongeBob.
No. Just kidding!
Yep. It's three times as fun.
What is?
Oh, SpongeBob, That reminds me. We should probably check the weather report before we go.
SpongeBob, this seems like a strange time to start decorating.
Hmm.
You can say that again.
Why?
Violin.
I guess Squidward's not part of nature.
He's the weatherman on the news channel. He said
I thought it was cocoa!
That's better.
SpongeBob!
I never realized how delicious your hot cocoa is.
He's right. You play rock, paper, scissors for it.
One.
Darn it!
Darn it! I'll get you next time.
Darn it!
Darn it!
I'm not seeing anything there.
Easy, friend.
Well played.
Cannot complete jigsaw puzzle! Difficulty level too advanced. Rate of brain activity increasing. Ageing process by 30 years per second.
Eh?
Who's the green guy?
Tell us.
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Will there be any spelling in this game?
Yes!
Did somebody say something to eat?
Hey, I want some too.
Oh, I almost forgot! Here's your Chum Kebab!
That, and the gift shop.
Hey, you'll never guess what I found on the street  yeah, I'll hurry
Hmmm
Open!
I just peel the stickers of the squares and put them back on in the right spaces
Are you going to take us for a ride?
What an interesting man
Do you think Triton was in that cage for a reason.
It's still standing.
Right
Gotcha pall  What?
Tell me about it, I never get free food here.
He's unstoppable.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Ah no, but I like your idea better!
You got it SpongeBob, scootch back a little.  Excuse me
Don't rush me! Okay got it!
Well SpongeBob that's...
Ahh, SpongeBob.
Do you think now's a good time to get those Triple Gooberry Sundays you where talking about?
Wow!
I'm on TV?!
I'm not on TV!  SpongeBob! I went home and turned on my TV, but... I wasn't on the TV. Why did you lie to me, SpongeBob? Why?
It varies.
Ohhh. I get it!  Hi, TV people!  And my mouth is on TV!
SpongeBob! You gotta try this!
Doubt it.
Cameraman?
All right!
Upsy-daisy! Downsy-wounsy! Upsy-daisy! Downsy-wounsy!
I gotta go potty!
My shorts are wet!
Hey SpongeBob, have you seen my rubber duckie?
I found you! Duckie Duck!  Quack, quack, quack!
Huh...
What do you need SpongeBob?
Stuck? I can help with that.  There ya go, buddy! Now you're stuck forever!
There, is that better?
Okay, ya know what, SquarePants? That's quitter talk. And are you a quitter?
And are you going to let this wringer get between you and your passion? Those sweet tomatoes, crisp onions. Are ya, SpongeBob?
That's the spirit!
Hey SpongeBob, how was work?
Hey! Don't you go crying on me!  Crying never solves anything. I know what always makes you feel better.
Dig in!
Bummer. Hey, ya know what? Forget this place. Let's go to the carnival. That's the funnest spot in the ocean.
Look! The ball toss!
We wanna play!
Thanks.  Woohoo!  Now you try.
Ohh! Ohh! The spinning steering wheels! Oh, we gotta do that!
Oh, come on! How many times does the carnival come to town?!  Ready?
SpongeBob?
Hey pal, want some of my cotton candy? They gave it to me when I won the dart tournament. I got this too!  Check it out!
Well, have some. It'll make you feel better.
You ruined my cotton candy!
What do you mean?
I was only trying to help.
Okay, if that's how you feel... I won't help you anymore!
Forget SpongeBob, I don't need him.  I can do whatever I want!  I don't need him.  Forget it, you're not his friend anymore. I gotta keep myself occupied so I don't think about Sponge--  I'm not gonna even say his name! What to do, what to do... I know! I'll have a staring contest!  Ohh, fiddlesticks. That game's too hard.
Who asked you?!  Forget it. I'll just play...uh... fetch!  Where is it? Where is it? Gotcha!  Is SpongeBob okay? Oh, what do I care? I'm no longer supposed to help.  Buddy!  Uhh! SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Hey, whatcha watchin'?
SpongeBob! Snap out of it! It's me, your best friend, Patrick!
Oh, man -- he's too far gone.
This is all my fault! Me and my dumb ideas!  I'm so sorry!
Well, at least we're together! Heh. Hey, should I get the glue?
Hey, everybody! Wait, that's not what I wanted to say. Now, what was it?
Oh, well. Never mind.
Gotta... Have... Crunchity... Munchities...
Mmm. Crunchity Munchities!
Oh, sorry to interrupt your fit of self-loathing, SpongeBob.  I'm just borrowing your refrigerator again.
Nothing, it's just empty.
Oh, don't get down on yourself, buddy. You can still purchase food for me.
Oh, no! What are you gonna do?!
I know, SpongeBob! Just do what I do when  looking for a job.  Kick back, watch some T.V.,  and chug down a carton on Drinkable Sausage!
No. Oh, but, yes! It's so obvious! You should work at the Krusty Krab. They need a fry cook!
Ohhh. Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you. He looks happy.
Why don't you get a job as a billboard?
Fine, do it your way.
Oh, you have the talent. But do you have the natural ability?
Why don't you find out?
No way! It's too late for that now. Krabs doesn't need you anymore.  is your chance to prove you don't need him. Now get in there and earn me some groceries!   My friend here wants to audition for the sponge model role.
SpongeBob. Hey, SpongeBob. Did you say something?
All right!
Yeah, beauty sleep!
Yeah.  Let's see here. I have a question about the Krabby Kiddy meal. Is it really, really, really cute?
Cuter than a regular Krabby Patty?
Oh yah! Yah! Yah! I want that!
Is this enough?
Oh, crud! That's everything I got! .
Share it?
Yeah yeah yeah.
I'm familiar with the concept of "sharing".
Sharing is fun.  Right SpongeBob?
What?
Hey!  Where's the toy?
What? That's a rip off! I want my money back!
My Kiddy meal didn't come with a toy!
Am I interrupting?
Don't you mean "our" new toy?
It came from the meal that we're "sharing."
Remember?  Sharing is the most wonderful feeling in the world, like dancing with a magical seahorse through an enchanted kelp garden  Remember those words, SpongeBob?
I thought we were sharing it?
Aren't you supposed to be working?
No.
Uh, maybe tomorrow.
NO TOUCHING!!! See you tomorrow  Say goodnight Patty Pal  Goodnight SpongeBob
Uh, I'm not home right now! Please leave a message! Beeeep!
I can't go out! I just washed my hair!
Got any ID?
Looks fake to me pal! Bye-Bye now!
You sure?
Deceiver! You didn't leave at all!
I was too, see?  Nice dismount!
Well, gotta go!
I can't! Patty Pal and me have really bonded!
Gary said that? You're off my friend list, Gary!!
You can't take it! It's not fair!
Mm-mm!
Mm-mm!
Mm-mm!
Mm-mm!
Mm-mm!
N-n-no!
One.
One.
SpongeBob won't let me play with my toy.
Oh boy.
Most definitely.
Communication is key.
No, it's mine!
If I can't have it, no one can!
SpongeBob won't let me play with it.
I did not!
Nuh-uh!
Tattletale!
This time it's on me.
Have you learned nothing about sharing?
Hmmm... Interesting. Me too! Let's go look for something to do in Old Man Squidward's shed!
Yyyeeeeeep!
What is it?
Hide!
SpongeBob?
Is this a trowl?
We're bored!
Yeah, The Flying Dutchman has a beard!
Your beard will just grow back.
Ghostified? That's not even a real word.
We're mermaids!
And Patrick! We're ghoooooooosts!  Ooohhhh!
Good night, ghost buddy!
I didn't sleep at all. I can see through my eyelids.  My eyelids!
My eyelids...
I don't either. I can't even eat anything! Food just goes right through me!
Maybe the weird hairless man will change us back?
Invisible to the world!
It's miserable!
And you can't go on your date because you're ugly?
I don't get it...
I win! I win!
Hey.. What are you doing here?
Must be all the pressure.
It must be... The pressure.
I gotta get outta here!
Yup!
Who?
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, something.
Hey, I caught one, too! This one's a five-spot.
You like it here so much, you feel yourself being moved to a song?
Well, I kinda feel the movement coming on myself.
You mean "The Jellyfishing Song"?
I jellyfish all da' night!
You bet! And it's highway convenient, too, according to that big sign!
It says, "Future site of the Shelly Super Highway."
Well, its sorta like other roads, except there's no sto-
So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single specie of flora & fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?
I, couldn't tell you.
SpongeBob, I'll never forget what my great-Uncle Cletus said right before he was arrested during a freedom march.
Oh, it's when a bunch of people go walkin' on a street, an-
Oh, . He said, "Let not your heart walk away from you, lest your mind grow legs and follow it."
I don't know, because no one one ever heard from him again.
It's a wig!
Oh, this isn't the middle of nowhere; We're actually on the edge of nowhere!
I am!
You mean like a parade?
There's one going by right there.
Look!
Does this?!
Su-Su-Su-Super!
Did you say something?
Im sure how to respond to that.
A pair of binoculars.
Well I lost a quarter.
SpongeBob!
Hiya, SpongeBob!  Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Well, if you want to be scary, you got to need a good costume.
Great! You're going as my trick-or-treat bag!
Uhh... something's missing. I know!  Step into these babies, Hans.  Terrifying.
Come on, SpongeBob. It's little kids! Little kids are easy to scare!
SpongeBob, look at my new paper ghost!  Oooh, scary.
What's it?
No, no, no wait. Don't tell me.  D-don't tell me. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! I can do this. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Okay, tell me.
Okay, are you ready?
Are you sure you want to do this?
All right, let's get to it.
Perfect. Now that's scary!  Let's go scare somebody.
Oooh... I don't know who I am!
Oooh, I'm the Flying Dutchman's best friend!
Oh boy, that was something. Your costume really packs a punch.
Oh, no question! You scared the barnacles off that guy!
There's a whole party just full of people at the Krusty Krab and the Flying Dutchman is going to be show up uninvited!  Here comes someone now!
Are you ready, SpongeBob?
Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I am the Flying Dutchman! Booga, booga, booga, booga! Give me your souls!
Huh?
I am not SpongeBob. Those are my street clothes!
Yeah, I guess it was your pink hat.
Oh.
Oh! What?!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy lost episode! Stick it in!
Hey!
I Can't watch!
Hey, what happened? Why are those squiggles on the screen?
End credits? But I don't want it to end!
Thank you Neptune!
Star... residence. Patrick speaking.
Hey, buddy! Is it 7:30 already?
How can I help you?
Well, of course you can.
Umm... sure. And did you remember to put that package outside where I told you?
Oh, yeah.  Hey, good one, buddy. You almost had me there.
Yeah, talk to you later.
Hey, thanks for the TV, SpongeBob.  I'm gonna watch it all night!
Wow, what a great show.
I like throwing food.
What?
Oh, staring contest! I thought it was a blinking contest and I was losing.
Hey, SpongeBob! I have something that might help.
Uh, ok.  Garbage cans. No. Jar. No. Box. No. Sandys door! Twist to the left.
A common mistake, my good friend.  Allow me.  Ok, time to open this.
Doesnt bother me.
Hmm, no. Its not cotton. Its actually an old moldy piece of Krabby Patty.  Mmm.
Eh, Im indifferent.
Look at yourself? How do you do that?
No more tight jeans!
Eh, pudding.
Did we save Sandy?
Look, another rubber stopper for my rubber stopper collection.  It's a little land that's all mine.  Now it's snowing in my little land.  It's snowing again.  Hey, my little land must be having an earthquake.  Must have been an aftershock.  Uh, hey, no wonder you're angry. You just gotta turn it upside down. See?
Snow globes are always funny.  Hey, you want to smell my armpit? There you go.
Hey, hey!
Hey, SpongeBob! Hey, up here! Look, no hands!
SpongeBob!
Uh, I wasn't being eaten. That monster is my friend. I thought you might like to meet him.
Well, in that case, SpongeBob, I would like to introduce you to... I would like to introduce you to... I forgot his name. What do I do? What do I do?
Okay.  Uh, I'd like you to meet my friend, SpongeBob.
And this is  home.
Doesn't have a home?  Hey, wait a minute, you can live under my rock if you want, Rarrg.
Yeah.  He's gonna smash your house now.
He's gonna smash Squidward's place now.
Encore!  Wow, the police have arrived.
Wait just one minute. This is my friend. If you want to get to him, you're gonna have to go through me.
Actually... just let me to talk to him for a minute. Psst.
Of course. He's a giant freak of nature, not a freak of nature that can't speak.  And so as the lowly snail sheddeth his shell, and the lofty gull moldeth his feathers, the brightest of friendships must dimmeth as the setting sun.
It really crushes my heart to see him go.
Yeah? Okay.  Two cubes, please.
SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend!  So, you ready or what?
Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!
The bus is here! The bus is here!  C'mon, SpongeBob!
Will you clam up?!
AAAAAAHHH!!!! My cuff links! They're missing! Oh, why? Why?
Has anyone seen my cuff links?!
Have you found my cuff links?
Yep. Pearl doesn't make them as good as you do, though.
Ah, riding by piggy-back is exhausting.
Whoa.
Ah, excuse me, hi.
Yeah...
You go ahead SpongeBob. I think I'm gonna hang with the ladies a bit.
Hey! I found my cuff links!  that's better. Good day, gentlemen.
Home, Reginald.
There I was, walking along, just minding my own business and then BOOM!  Some dumbbell put this thing in the way.  Whatcha doing?
Uh-huh.
Sorry.
Two little kids?
Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of baggage about drain dealies.
We should go find it! To protect it from people like us.
Ohh, don't worry, we're not little kids. We're all grown up!  Hey! A baby tooth!
Ewwwwww...
Let's ask Plankton. He's a geezer.
So we've been looking for it!
Why?
Oh man, I hope this question;s not for me. I hate questions.
Dah-uhhh! 42. No, triangle! Meatballs! Screwdrivers! Pajamas!
Okay.
Oh, no thanks. I'm not into the whole walking thing.
Wait for it to come to us.
I love it!
Oh! Oh! I know exactly what to do!  NEEIIGGHH
Owww. Oh.  Huh, I found it!
Let's pull it.
Well, that was the whole point of coming here right?
Well, how do we know if this one is a fake?
We won't know unless we pull it!
And if we don't, we'll never know...
Yeah, We almost messed up big time. Pheeeww.
It's the most realistic story I've ever heard!
Peek-a-boo!
SpongeBob, does that guy look suspicious to you?  I think he might be spying on us.  Hey, where'd he go!? All this suspicious thing is making me hungry.
Yeah. And they gave you so much food, you need 2 forks.
What is that?
With pleasure. Prepare for a thorough search, shorty.
Just after I scrub this bowl.  Alright, Plankton, time to squeeze the key out of you.  After my tasty snack.  He's clean.
Cops, I need you!
You may not be a butler, but are you a werewolf?
Sorry.
Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure it'll turn up.
I found it when I was cleaning your shorts from your little "accident" earlier.
Anyways, I'm gonna hit the sack. I'm pooped. I'm sure you can relate.
Say, would you mind scooching over? I can't even move my eyebrows.
What a cool view.
Well, I guess he lost us. You ready to call it a day, SpongeBob?  Guess not.
Gotcha, pal. Oh, wait, I can't count that high. Can we just jump on the count of one?
Great, now what?
Well, I don't think this is the right time for a piggyback ride.
Okay. But I don't see how this is gonna get us any closer to the tr--  Are you crazy?! Please! I'm sorry for any grief I've caused you! Don't do it, please!  Hey, we're flying!
You can't hide forever.
That was odd.
Hey, where'd all thosethose shiny tubes?
Hmm. In that case...
What do I do? What do I do?  B-R-A-K-E. BRAKE. I can do that. Well, SpongeBob, I think our troubles are over.
It told me to.
I'm on it.  Maybe shoveling in these black rocks will help.
Hi.
Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. I'll save us!  Ice-cold lemonade! Get your ice-cold, tasty, refreshing, and also ice-cold lemon...  Hey! Everyone stops for free lemonade!
Hey. Hey, wait for me...  Hey, SpongeBob!
Hey, would you quit messing around? You're making me sick.
Hmm.  T-H-R-O-T-T-L-E. Brake! I can do that.  You didn't need this, did you?
No offense, but your yard gargles tartar sauce.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I'm good at choosing! Hmmmm... let's play innnn... SpongeBob's yard! No! Patrick's! Errrr... SpongeBob!  I'm terrible at choosing! Squidward! You choose!
SpongeBob!
SpongeBob!
SpongeBob!
I'll mail myself to your house!
Hey, SpongeBob.
Okay!
What are we gonna do?!
No.  SpongeBob?
Tag!You're it!
Tag!
You're it!
Knock, knock!
I don't know!
They're dancing!
Squidward's house wants to play too!
Must've been something it ate.
That'll do it
And we're insulted!
No need to thank us.
You're welcome.
Missed.
Tag! You're it!
Wheeeeeeee!
HE'S COUNTING, ANYTHING BUT COUNTING! Quick, SpongeBob! Dig for your life!
He's already at Number Two! Who knows how many numbers we have until he reaches three?
Hey buddy. You still got that bucket of cheese?  Oh no! He's... not right! Don't worry, pal! I'll help you!
Buddy! You okay?
Hey! I want to learn how to do that.
Uhhuh!
If I recall correctly, I seem to remember saving your life a few minutes ago.
I also remember you saying, "If there's anything you can do to return the favor, anything at all... to let you know.
Then teach me.
Oh yeah Mama!
Inverty whirpey... Got it!
Woohoo! That was awesome!
Yeah! Yeah!  Ha Ha Ha Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!  Hey, how do you stop this thing?
Definitely!
What?! I...!  Barnacles!
Wow!
Clamo!
Yeah! I bet I can chop anything!
HIIIII-
I'm a genius?
Yesss...
Okay! I'm a genius!
Karate power!
Hi-yah SpongeBob!
Good day, gents! Ahhh, Squidward, I would like a HIYAAA!
I said one Krusty Combo. Don't you speak karate?
Looks delish.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're the one who called me a karate genius. And, frankly, I'm offended by your previous accusation. I don't need this! I beg you good due.
No buts! just hands.
Uuuuuhhhhh... Seaweed Surprise! Also!... uuuuuuhhhhh... Malted Coral Crunch!  Oooh... Ooh, also, Lipids and Creme!
You dare refuse my barter?!?! Than accept my chop!  Ahhh... I don't feel so good.
What is that wonderful stench?  Whatcha got there?
NO! It's more fun to chop! Hahahahahahaha!
I win, I win, I win!
HIYAA HIYAA-
SpongeBob, just the man I was looking for. I wanted to thank you, buddy.
For teaching me how to karate chop, silly.
Wooooooooooo.
You got it, buddy. No more karate chops!
I know! Weird, huh?
Oh. Okay. I know, I'll stop a chop, with a chop!
HIYA YA! Not the muffin display... YAAAAH!
Not the giant-screen TVs... Oh no!
Noooo! Gianter TVs! HIYAAA!
I'm trying to but this thing has a mind of its owwwnnnn...  YAAAAAA!
YA YA HIYA AYA!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob? SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SPONGEBOB!!! Oh no, I'm so sorry, my best friend, crushed by all this rubble, entombed in this cheap, plastic bag.
So I haven't crushed the life of my best friend in the world?
SpongeBob! Oh no!  Ohhh, I'll never forgive myself  No! I'll never forgive you!
SpongeBob, you're okay!
Ha! Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm a sea star. My limbs grow back. See?
And in the spirit of healing, I vow to use my hands only to join things together, starting here!
Oh I did. Unfortunately, we sea stars have limbs that grow new bodies.
SpongeBob! SpongeBob, did I make it? I brought my favorite rock to donate to the time thinger.
Sometimes you've got to make sacrifices.
Thank you, my good man.
Okay, Rocky, you're going bye-bye now.
What didn't? Hey, look, a yo-yo!
Yeah, it looks fun!
I'm just gonna hang here for a while, maybe get a kelp soda later.
50 years? What are we gonna do till then?
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
I believe my left hand was on red.
Forehead on yellow.
Hey, SpongeBob, what do you think Bikini Bottom will be like in the future?
Not bad, SpongeBob. Not bad. I dream of a town with a perfect blend of commerce and irrigation.  Not to mention the breathtaking views.
Nice try, Squidward, but we both already got that hiding spot figured out.  Whipped cream!  Oh, this whipped cream tastes awful!  "Sha-veeng g-el." I've always wanted a beard!
Yeah! I love playing Buddy Toss!
Ow!
Trying to have a relaxing evening.
We're using the advanced rules.
Tag.
Shocking!
But we can play hide and seek too.
Yeah, let's go poke someone else.
Oh, like that time when I was feeling depressed, and you let me eat all... I mean feed Gary for a week.
Vow?
Well, how about instead of vowing, we just do it?
A smoothie
SpongeBob, I told you we should have used glue instead of earwax
Yeah, we really tried to make it last
Ow!
He doesn't wanna play with us.
Hey SpongeBob! Are you ready to...  SpongeBob, you promised firsties!
Oh man! That was the best time I've ever had!  Oh. Hello, SpongeBob. Did you enjoy not going to Glove World! with me?
SpongeBob, you've got to learn to say 'no'. Stand up for yourself! You need thicker skin like me! . Oh, hey, which reminds me.  Could you scratch my back?
Hey, SpongeBob! You're right on time for our play date
I don't know!
Yes? May I help you?
I don't know, are we buddies?
I'm so confused!
No problem!
Hey, buddy!
SpongeBob! Where are you?
SpongeBob! Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.
Hold still, buddy!
Hi, uhh...
SpongeBob!
Yeah?
Yeah!
SpongeBob?
Do I have to know what hide-and-seek is in order to play it?
Dozens?
Thousands?!
Gosh!
I didn't know hide-and-seek had so much mathematics.
Hey, you're peeking!
Play what?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I do! I do know how to play!
I- I just have one tiny question.
What's hide 'n seek?
Hide and seek: a game played by two or more players in which one player chosen at random counts aloud to a pre-determined number while the remaining players hide. Upon reaching said number, the counting player now embarks on a search for the other players.  The search continues until all players are located and a winner is determined.
Hide 'n seek sure sounds fun, I just wish I could play!
Oh no! I can't!
Because... I don't have any socks!
What socks?
One, two, three...
Seven, eight...
Seventy-eight, seventy-nine, a hundred! FOUR! A-ha! I found you. I win, I win, I win! In your face  I must be the best hide and seek player ever!
OF COURSE! I'm the best hide and seek player ever aren't I?
Do you hear that? No what is that? Oh, it's SpongeBob. Why is he counting? I guess I'll just go home, maybe or later he'll want to play a game or something.
Underwear.
"Dear Patrick: I couldn't find you so you win. But that's OK because I still had fun playing. You are truly the greatest hide and seek player in the whole world. Love SpongeBob. Thanks SpongeBob. That really means a lot."
I still have one question.
What's hide and seek?
Maybe. Or maybe it's those guys.
Ewwww! We're all covered in slime!
SpongeBob, you're leaking.
Say no more.
What are those things?
Well, I'm not afraid of them! Watch this!
Wait, hold on a second.
Can't talk, Running!
Spon... Spo... Spo...!
SpongeBob, what are we going to do?
Uh, is this a trick question?
You guys go, I'll hold them off.  And if I failed, at least my sacrifice will be delayable!
Okay, you go!
It's in his eye!
And my favorite is the plaintiff song of the blue whale. Ahem.
Yeah. And it made me look more smart-like.  What does the magazine say we should do next?
Oh, no. After you, old buddy.
Please. After you, pal.
I hate to burst your bubble, but my favorite color is........ it is aquamarine. Sorry I doubted you.
How did you know?
Aww!
No peeking!
Oh! What will his answer be?
Well, let's just check that theory!  Innie!  Wow! How does he do it?
My turn! But, give me some hard questions. Not like those softballs you answered.
Aw, man! Pulled out the big guns. Color. Color.
No, no! No hints!  Blue! No, clear! No!  That's not it. Hold on, hold on. 14.
Oh, barnacles! Oh, I was so close.
Oh, tricky, tricky. Hmm, right, or, left? Right-handed!
Oh, fish paste!
Belly button, huh? Hmm. An innie!
Tartar sauce!
Uh...
Oh! Oh! I remember! Your favorite food is a chum burger!
I thought for sure I had that one.
Ooh. That's a toughie.  Hmm. Rugged biceps.  Yet, delicate eyelashes. Pass!
Ooh! This is for the win!
Oh! I got this one! Um, uh, can you repeat the question?
Round, flat, uh, hexagon.
Ooh! It's right on the tip of my tongue!
Um, um, oh, jeez, trapezoid, pentagon, mormorphis...
TRIANGLE!!
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
That was fast.  Don't worry buddy, there's plenty of fish in the street car.
Busy, I'll catch up with you later.
Oh No!! I'm out of coral on a stick!  Time to chomp through the fried barnacles!
This is my worst nightmare!! I don't have a drink!
Huh?
You mean SpongeBob!
I'm coming SpongeBob!
My best buddy is trapped in there! You gotta let me through!
Fine!  Well mister police guy won't let me in the front huh! Well, I'll just find my own way in!
Let's see. Where could SpongeBob be?  Aha!  Con-grat-ulations! You have-uh-ooh-fouuunnd-uh your friend!  Oh, SpongeBob is right behind this door! I'm coming to get you buddy!  SpongeBob?! Where-? Oh there you are!  Hang in there! I'll free you from your shackles!  You're okay now buddy! Go to your happy place! .
Not another skunk! How did you beat me again?  Hey. You find it funny to lock up my best friend? Hey I am talking towards you.
I unfortunately don't know who that dullard is, but I know you kidnapped SpongeBob.
Wow! I see you are a magician. But that voodoo does not erase what you just have done.
Geez. Some people are so pushy.
Oops.
You told me to sit on it.
Okay, Okay. I think I heard you. I will not sit on anything else. I'll just gingerly lean on this wall.
Nice facilities. Great water pressure.
Are you gonna finish that?
You're it!
Hey, try to catch me, SpongeBob!
Oh, this game's too hard!
But then, who's gonna be not "it?"
Oh, I like not knowing! Let's play!
I'm it!  SpongeBob!  Hang on, buddy, I'm coming! AHHHH!
Look at all these cool stuff!  I'm the captain!  Yo, ho, ho, ya mateys! Arr!  Got ya! En garde!  Thanks, SpongeBob. I guess we better be more careful.
Okay.
Ooh, shiny and smooth.
Hey, SpongeBob, check out the new t-shirt I just made!  Secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hideout, secret hide
You got it, Mr. Krabs!
Hmm, well, let's see.
Keep the change, my good man!
Oh, jeez, SpongeBob, who cares if everyone knows about our secret hideout?
No. It's just a secret that everybody knows about.  What's wrong, SpongeBob?
Well, maybe they had something against short people. I like their little clothes.
No wonder we were so amused!
And alas, even the joyous shrieks of children cannot lift my sunken heart!
Let's do this!
Yeah! Totally realistic!
And just when everyone was staring to find out about it, too.
Well, I doubt it.
Nope!
Oh! Ooh! Can you smell yourself think?
Or see?
How, how about taste? Can you taste yourself think?
Need a little extra cash if you know what I mean?
First come, first, serve.
Yeah, thanks.
A mobile is parked right in my front yard!
SpongeBob, what do you say we go knock on the door and say "Hi"?
Hey, SpongeBob? Did you see the way those curtains jerked shut?
Maybe we could visit him, later.
Look! Our new neighbor must be even shyer than we thought!
Go on. Pop it!
Dinner is served.  Don't try to eat it. It's plastic.
Here you go, ma'am!
Hey, Squidward, who's the lovely lady? I think she's giving me the cutesy eye!
So, do you hang out here often?
Not quite, I was promised a movie, and some plastic popcorn.
Makin' it clean, and livin' a dream. Makin' a scene, I'm makin' it clean, I'm makin' it clean. I'm makin' it clean!
Cause I'm expecting some very important company.
My big sister, Sam!
Nobody does. I lost her in the surf when we were kids.
Sam took care of me when I was just nursing on coral. She was my... my... my... rock!
Thanks man, you're right. I can't wait to make up for our lost years!
Sorry, I was getting my place ready for my sister.
...Sam!
Sis!
It's so good to see you.
Wow, you pack a wallop, sis. Sam, this is my best friend SpongeBob.
I cleaned my rock just for you.
Lets go inside and play.
Hey great idea! I'll just go and get some tools and-
Huh?
Thanks sis!
Shame on you two! Look what you've done!
Awwww hey sis, don't listen to those...meanies. Hey the new rock is looking kinda...boring. What do you say we decorate it?
You can call it whatever you like sis as long as we make it spiffy!
That's the spirit, Sis.
Hey, just mind your own business and let us blecorate in peace!
How dare you call my sister a thief, just because she took some of your things...
No I don't. Not even a teensie, eensie, teensie bit. I see now that you've turned against my sister, you've turned on your best friend as well!
Come on sis they won't bother us under our rock.
Your still my rock big sis.
SpongeBob, why are you still saying mean things about Sam?
Well I guess she can get a little carried away.
Well uh...well...well it's about your temper Sam.
Not the rock!
Cookie Dough!
Sis, wait! Hold on! Aw, don't feel sad. You don't have go!
Bye sis.
Isn't my sister something?
Uhh, do what again? Ow!
Ow!
Uh, breakfast, green, Finland.
Ready to lose? Weather permitting, of course.
Dumb rain! Doesn't anybody know I'm the sheriff in these parts? Hey, rain! You better stop that!
AAAAAAHHH!!!!!
But we sculpted your likeness out of butter on hole five.
Join us on the back nine?
Can't wait to lose, huh?  NO! Ooh. If you would just let me finish my stretches, I wouldn't have missed my first shot!
Nice shot.
Moving my ball.
Fine. Have it your way.  Ready to give up?
Ha! Let's see how you do against the windmill. You haven't got a chance.
Oh, it is just a game, which I am gonna win.
Speaking of m-m-MISSING!  Ha! Gotta play it where it lands. Watch and learn, SquarePants. Watch and learn.  YES! See if you can top that!
SpongeBob readies the approach shot. He's gotta be very careful he doesn't hook the shot here, because this would certainly be an inopportune time for a bogey. A pressure-packed shot to be sure.
Looks like we're tied, three shots to three.
Whatever.  AND HE SINKS ANOTHER HOLE IN ONE! That's two in a row!
Watch out for the water hazard.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Show-off. I can do that.
Well, how do I know? I was just copying you.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on there, fella. It's not over yet.
Who said anything about noise? We're just gonna get outta the rough and back to the course!
Okay, okay!
Oh!
Was it a red one?
It might have been in the kelp salad.
Don't worry, I'll get it.
No?
I don't know. Gotta be around here somewhere.
Uh-oh.
Hole in one! Top that!
Wait up! Warmer. Warmer. Red hot!
Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Red hot! Red hot!  Wait, My mistake. You're right. Oh, Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hot. Red hot. Red hot! SpongeBob, red hot!  Wrong again.
Stop peeking! Hotter. Hotter! Hot! Hot! Cold. Hot. Cold. Hot! Cold.
AAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!
I was just freshening up. These fancy fixtures are touchy  Hot! Red hot! Ah! Cold! Cold!
But I wanted to try his loofah.
Uhh, look a little closer, buddy.
Play it where it lies.
All it takes is a little finesse, SpongeBob. All it takes is a little finesse.
Fore!  It's all yours.
But I thought we weren't betting.
Sorry we woke you.
Good game, pal.
Rain or shine, SpongeBob. Rain or shine.
Hey, SpongeBob!
It's Spring Cleaning Day?! Why didn't anyone tell me?!
Found it! Thanks for the reminder, SpongeBob!  See ya again next spring.  Whatcha got in your trash can? Huh! You're throwing this away!!?? The wrapper of the gum I gave you yesterday!!??
Oh! Some people just don't understand sentimental value.  You're throwing away Pete!? Y-You can't part with a keepsake! That's why you keep them, for Pete's sake! Hmph! Why, I'm disgusted! It's time you re-evaluate your priorities.
Nice dress.
Huh?
Do you mean she puts on "airs"?
Thats just fancy talk. If you want to be fancy, hold your pinky up like this! The higher you hold it, the fancier you are!
Higher!
Now that's fancy! They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants!  Remember: When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching.
Pinky! Pinky!
When in doubt, pinky out.
No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky!
You can't leave now! You'll blow it!
You're just being shy. Don't worry, buddy. You're doing fine.  I won't let you blow... this.  WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS?!  There's no water in here!
We've got to get out of here!
We know, We've got... to get... out.
Hi SpongeBob.
Yup.
Yup.
Okay. Bye SpongeBob.  Oh!  Shoot, that was my last quarter.
SpongeBob!
Does anyone have a quarter?
I hear ya. I hope I win so I can buy all the Krabby Patties I want! It will be the run of the heavy artillery: Gooey Worms!
Sure they do! Giddy up!  Yeah! See?
Come on, wormies! Giddy up! Hmmmm...
Hey, SpongeBob.
I don't know.
Whoa! Look at that!
Good idea.
It's-s-s... so c-c-cold!
Oh, be careful, this is my last one!
SpongeBob! Come on!  Let's get outta here!
Hey!
I saw something shiny.
We gotta bust him out, quick! I'm gonna sit on him!
I can't feel my looking holes!
I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least,  I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over.  Hey! Is this taxi even moving?!  Come on, Gary!
Great, now we're stuck.
Hey, trying to sleep.
Oh geez... why do I have to do everything?
Hahahaha!
Oh, that's easy!
Hi, SpongeBob!
Hi, SpongeBob!
I sure am old buddy!
Yeah! I love boat screaming! Oh! Oh! Hey! Hey! Here comes another one!
AHHHHHHHHHH!
How do you play that?
Ow!  What's the big idea!?
I do?
Wow! You really think so?
I am curious to know what mature people, like Squidward, do. Won't you show me?
Show me! Show me! Oh please, please, please! Pretty please! Pretty please!
Hooray!
Sounds good to me!
New clothes?
Distinguished?
Yeah!
Oh, right!
Heh heh, sure are!
For a baby!
Why certainly.
Oh! Are those chocolate chip cookies? Can I have-
Duh, yeah Squidward. I'm frankly shocked they serve such elementary fare here.
Boring!
Oh, ah no. I said flooring! The flooring compliments the artwork here exquisitely!
Security!
Let's shall!
Why are they so many stairs!?
It feels like four.
What?
Hey, alright! Box seats! Uh, I mean: This seat choice is most mature! Certainly more so than that rapscallion Sponge whose name we shall not mention will picked!
A most exemplary performance!
She's beautiful!
Hey! Stop that beard!
How do you know my name!?
SpongeBob!
Oh, please! You can call me Patrick!
Oh, sorry, wrong rock.
Okay.  Uhhh...
Okay.
H-Hold on, I'd like to sit in the back of the class.
SpongeBob, can I have a hall pass?
Fine.
Boring! Next!
All right, all right.
Oh, come on, SpongeBob, you think everyone can stay awake through a boring speech?
Yes! And you should be prepared for worse.
You're gonna have things thrown at you that you wouldn't believe. You gotta be ready. Now try again.
That's it!  Fight through!
Says you! Speech!
SpongeBob SquarePants, what a mess you've made of my classroom.
Young man, how dare you!
I'm not hearing your oral report.
Try again.
Come on, SquarePants! Is this the best you can do?
Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Speech!  Speech! Speech! Spee -
Yeah, you do look pretty terrible.
Wait, buddy! I know how you can get your boating license. Your friend the squirrel girl is real good with her paws.  Maybe she can make you a fake one.
Yeah, or she probably has a robot that can demolish the whole school for ya.
Go on, buddy.
Right here. Let me polish them up for ya.  Here ya go.
Hey, where are you going? You forgot your goggles! SpongeBob, wait!  SpongeBob!
Wait, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob!
Hey, buddy, you got over your fear of getting an oral talking thing.
Oh, that reminds me.  You forgot these.  Whoa-ho! Oh, they really work! Heh!
You're an artist?
I've been making baskets too.  Darn! This hammer is defective.
Oh man. I'll never make art like you and...Squidward!
Uh.
Uh.
Whoa. Slow down, SpongeBob.
Whoa. I did not see that coming!
I'm scared.
I shall make the attempt!  Privacy, please?
I've done it!
Behold!
I'm an artist!
I'm an artist! Hooray!
Don't judge me!
Is that good?
Yeah!
Um...ok!  Art!
So long, my trusted, yet untalented friend!  One for you! And one for you! And one for...  I've run out of rocks to put googly eyes on! I've run out of rocks!
Um, the artist needs a long time!
I'm all out of rocks! What am I going to do now? That was my thing! Oh!  Tartar sauce!  That stinks, too!  The artist needs a lunch break!
Uuuuuummmmm! Uhhhhhhhhh! I'm thinking about having a Krabby Patty.
But I'm wondering if that might be too predictable!
I don't know! I'm not feeling very inspired at the moment!
Maybe, I don't know! I'm in a creative slump!
Ok, I want new ideas to spice up hunger for my goodly goods!
Well then, why is it on the menu?
Oh, you can borrow mine!
Mm-hmm. Pleasure!
Oh, yeah. Keep it open. We may be here all night! Let me say up front, I'm a fan! I'm excited to learn from a genius like you. My artistic needs and knowledge are in your hands! I hope someone's writing all this. Ok........... advise!
Of course, it's so obvious now! How did I not see it earlier? Squidward's a genius! I know now what I must do!
And I'm going to need some more of those patty thingies!
It's my art. Uh, I buy Krabby Patties for $3 and I..I sell them for $50.
Why is he so mad, Squidward? I was just following your advice!
I can only imagine! Apprentice! Make another of my masterpieces, good man.
If you work real hard, you might be an artist too someday!
Mm, probably not. Needs more glitter.
Giddy-up! Hyah!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hashbrowns!
Right. The slides.  Voila! Uh, now what?
I knew that. Put the slides in the projec--  ...tor. Don't worry, SpongeBob. I've got something even better.  Okay, here we go.  There I was...
Please, no interruptions.
As I was saying...  I was lying around my house, not even planning to have a vacation when I heard a knock at my door.  For clammin' out loud! Aww, sheesh! I'm still not there yet?
I've been waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping, waking up, eating, sleeping for my whole life without a rest. I need a break from the hustle and bustle of my everyday life.  It's so exhausting.  Help me, SpongeBob. Please, help me.
That's it! I need a vacation.
Oh, great. Another thing for me to d--
I guess I'll just have to stay home.
Wh-what's that?
Oh boy!
So why are we going to Sandy's house?
Who?...What?...Why?
Can you not imply anymore? It's confusing.
Hey! Who's Carol's real father?!
Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Hey, SpongeBob. Going skiing?
What? Oh, you can't go!
I know a guy who knows a guy who went to the doctor once, and the doctor's office is a horrible, horrible place!
Oh, it is, SpongeBob! Well first, they make you sit in the waiting room.
No, it gets worse. They make you read old magazines!  Then the doctor pulls out his stethoscope.
Yes! It's a device so sinister, so icy cold when it touches your bare flesh, it...  Ssssss!
Exactly.
What else are friends for?  It appears as though we'll have to plug up these holes. This oughta do the trick.  Voil!  Feel better?
Help, I'm shrinking!  No! Please don't hurt me!
You think so?
And they said I'd never make anything out of myself.
Sure, patient SpongeBob.  Hello, Sandy?
I'm calling on behalf of my patient, SpongeBob.
Uhh, uhh, that will no longer be required. He is in my care as of today.
Oh yeah, yeah, the rabbit. Don't bother, Sandy!  Oh, SpongeBob, quick, Sandy's coming! We've got to make sure you're well, or she'll take you to the doctor!  Don't touch me, I'm sterile! Scalpel, please.  Feeling better?
Feeling better yet?
How...about...now?
Feeling better?
How about now?
How about now?
Uh-oh, it's Sandy.  There's no one home.
Uhh, uhh, he's not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. Beep.
Since I ran out of space to put my stuff.
This is my mobile home.
Hmmm, the dirt therapy seems to be working just fine.
No, he doesn't! I'm taking good care of him! Show her, SpongeBob! Say 'ahh'.
What do you mean? He's fine.
Hey, that's my patient!  You can't take him to the doctor's.
He's mine!
I'll save you!
What I've done? Everything was fine until you showed up.
I am a good doctor, right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob?
A lollipop?  Hey, doc, I have the suds, too.
Hey, wait.  Ouch! That hurts!  Wait, this doesn't seem right!
Yeah, it really calms my inner demons.
I'm not seeing it. Ooh, check out that cloud!  It looks just like a... um, um, um, d'oh, it's coming, uh, looks like a... a cloud.
Sure does! Um... who's Mr. Krabs again? Oh, now that cloud looks like a flying houseboat.
It's probably just one of those fake haunted houses, you know, for babies.
It looks like fun, I'm going to check it out
Hey, SpongeBob, can you give me a boost?
A little to the left.  A little help?
Wow. Look at this place! It's so cheesy! Check out this lame doorknob.
Let's check out inside.
Oh, come on, don't be such a baby!  Wow, so lame!
Nice attention to detail, though.
Huh. So not scary!
Did you say something, SpongeBob?
Hey, SpongeBob, check this out!
Even the spiders are fake! I wish something would... pop out of a closet! Like a big, hairy hand!  That would be scary!  But this place is too low budget for that!  It would be cool, though, wouldn't it?
I think it's coming from that guy!
We do!
Look at the attention to detail in his mouth. It's so rotten and slimy.  His bad breath is incredible! His hair is very thin, too. It's dirty.  Eww. It reeks, and check out the workship on the jaw mechanism.  Remarkable-built quality!  Obviously a puppet or a robot! Hey, we must be in one of those pizza parlors, with one of those singing animated robots!
Sing us a song, robot!
Oh, whoops! You're right. I almost forgot. You're coin-operated, aren't you?
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
Nope!
This show is going to be so awesome.
They're good!
Where's my pizza? What kind of pizza joint are you running anyhow?
That's more like it!
Oh, please don't kill me with your death ray eyes, Mr. Ghost Robot! Take my best friend instead! He's lived a full life!
Houseboat full of ghosts!
And it was full of ghosts! The really, real kind, not fake kind!
Four years? Gotta be longer than that.
Think?
Again?
My soul.
Well, I thought mine seemed a little flat.
Get me out of here!
Nooooooooooooooooo!
Wow. This void sure is relaxing!  Hey! I've got a doughnut on my head! Come here, you.  Hey! Get back here!  Why is this happening to me?
Not really. I don't like plain doughnuts.
Um, I like sprinkles!
No, chocolate! No, a bagel! No-no-no-no, pancakes! No-no-no...
Okay, okay! Man, you're pushy! How about... a Krabby Patty? With pickles! And ketchup! Wait, wait, wait, I know! I want... a plain doughnut!
Here's your milkshake, Sandy.
Let's do this!
Oh, hmm... I don't know. We might be able to pull through...  the first hour.
Check.
Check.
Check.
Yeah, we owe you one!  What now, SpongeBob?
Thanks for nothing, Squidward.
We wanna watch your TV!
But, but... now how will we ever learn about their secret "gorinin"?
...Yeah, so?
Whoa! You're like a brain professor!
Yeah, how'd you two meet?
This is gonna be so super awesome!
I'm talking to my friend, Funny.  Hi, Funny!
What is it?
Are you going off the grid?
Don't worry, I know what I do. You're gonna need one of these.
You got it. He's safe with me!
What's that?
Got it! Hey, do you have any more of those deep fried cream filled sugar-coded coral balls?
Ooh, coral balls.
You can't get to my stomach now, white coral ball.
SpongeBob!  Don't you trust me? I am the most responsible guy you know!
Well, of course I am!  Now, go see your Gramma. Gary's in good hands.  Yep! Looks like it's just you and me, friend.
Hmmm... I wonder what we should do first.  You need to work on your handwriting, SpongeBob. I don't need this anyway.  Oh! I know! Let's go for a walk!
Oh. Looks like my tummy is having an argument with the coral balls. Ohhh...
Better.
Oh, hey, friend! What's up?
Step aside, Barry. Let me show you how it's done.  Ooh. Gotta try a bite of this.  Ahh.  Good stuff.
I wonder what SpongeBob's got for you in the fridge.
He's safe with me.
Hello?
Oh, Gary! Yeah, he's fine.
Whew! SpongeBob was right. You need a bath!  Oh! I almost forgot.  Snail food!
Gotta get the water to stay in there somehow.  Now, Gary, we don't eat the bath. We get in the bath.  Come on, Gary.  Oh, don't be difficult now, Gary.  Gary!  There you are!  Oh, what now?  SquarePants household.
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
Okay, I get it, SpongeBob! I get it, I get it!  No!  I don't get these new beguiled shower heads.   Gary! Time for your-   Wait a minute, Patrick! You gotta trick the snail!  You gotta be smarterer than him!  Hey, buddy! I got something cool to show you. And it's the opposite of a wet watery bath.  Take it down!
Doesn't that look fun?
Well, make up your mind! Is it water or fire?  Okay, Gary. If you don't come to the bath, then the bath's gonna come to you.  That's a good boy! Now, suds up!
That wasn't so bad, now was it?
Oh, now we gotta dry you off. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any salt. So, I'll have to use the next best thing!  There! Doesn't that feel better? Okay!  Let's see, Gary's eaten, he's had his bath, Time to watch the T.V.!  Sheesh, Gary! Well, if you wanted another bath, why didn't you just ask?
SquareyPants' house.
Who is this?
Oh, yeah. He's-
"Snail Tales"? I thought it was called, "Meow, meow, meow."
Well, in that case, I'd better stay and help you.
Pleeease?
Pretty please?
Pretty please with a scoop of vanilla ice cream?
Pretty please with a scoop of strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, smothered in gooberberry sauce and topped with half a can of whipped topping?
Hooray!
I, Patrick Star, hereby promise not to touch anything.
I wasn't touching anything!
Um...Tasting it.
Is this close enough?
Not... touch anything.
Not do anything.
Not... look at anything.
Until... SpongeBob is done house sitting.
It wasn't me!
Hey buddy, it's not as bad as it seems.
Well, not everything is broken.
Did you bring back any souvenirs?
SpongeBob, this is it, our final goodbye.
At a handsome squirrel?
Hooray!
It wasn't me.
Excuse me, sir, do you have any ketchup.
Two words, SpongeBob "na" "chos."
What's that?
Tummy want more.
I would like two extra cheesy nachos with a side of cheese and two vanilla coral shakes.  Actually, make that two cheese coral shakes. And instead of whipped cream on top, I'll take cream cheese on the bottom. That's it for now.
Keep it jazzy, Miles. And thanks for the grub.
After you.
My turn.
Wow.  Medesonium prodamy!
Yeah, yeah. Spice.  No spice. Hmm...  Hot sauce!  Spicy bubbles. ]
I wonder if hot sauce is bad for our eyes.
I must have more.
Yeah, I thinked it up with my own head. Now I'm as smart as Sandy
Why don't you just breathe water like a smart person?  Guess you're just too dumb.
Even I knew that was dumb.
I'm not sure. Let me check.  Oh!
She's totally losing it.
Never mind. She seems fine.
Don't worry. She's not going anywhere.
Get what over with?
I thought she was with you.
Uh--uh--  Hey, everyone. Look! There's some air bubbles trapped on the ceiling.
Hurry up, SpongeBob. I'm no doctor, but I don't think squirrels are suppose to be blue.
Just a little bit further. Okay, got it.
Looks like her color's coming back.
But how are you going to get up there?
An oxygen tank! Great idea, buddy.
SquarePants, I salute you.
Hey, who did that? Hey! Oh! Ghosts!
Ah, ah! Oof!
Hello?
SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?
Oh my gosh! Sponge...SpongeBob is stuck inside this rock!  Hold on buddy, I'll get you out!  SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob!  SpongeBob...!
There you are.  Happy Valentine's Day! Here's your present.
You do?
Huh? Why not?
Is it ready now?
How about now?
Yes!
Oh, come on, please!
You gotta tell me!
Please. Oh please...  ...please-please-please-please. Tell me-tell me-tell me. Please?!
You got me a carnival? Mine! All mine, mine, mine, mine.  Mine, mine, mine! All right, everybody out! This is my carnival!
Oh.
Oh my gosh, a quarter! I've always wanted a quarter!
Oh.
Cotton candy! I can't believe it!  Cotton candy!
So if it's not cotton candy then what is it? I can't take it!
This tent?
This guy?
This paramecium?
Heh, you're a sly one. I can't find here in the carnival...because it's on top of Mount 'Climb Up and Fall Off'.  It wasn't there either!
I'm pretty sure it's not up there, SpongeBob!
Ferris wheel!  I'm ready for the greatest Valentine's present in the whole world now, SpongeBob.
No...no...eh-gee! Holy mackerel! Is it hot up here or what!
What's that?
A handshake? That's the big gift? You got me a handshake?
I've been thinking. At first a handshake doesn't seem like much, but really it's the thought that counts
And even though I was expecting more...
And not that it matters that we've been friends for so long...
So as I was saying...
Patrick needs love, too!
I defy you, Heartman!
Heart on stick must die!  Heart on stick must die!
Huaaagh!
Give me SpongeBob!
You broke my heart! Now I'm gonna break something of yours!
They didn't get me anything either!  Nope, it's too late for that now... for all of you!
Sure it is.
Uh-uh.
You must think I'm pretty dumb, huh?
No.
Nuh-uh. I'm gonna say this once and I'm not going to say it again, so pay attention. I am not, I repeat, not going to turn around for any reason...ever!
Hi Sandy!
Yay! My valentine! Hey, is this solid chocolate?
Aw SpongeBob, you didn't have to get me anything.
Hehe.
Hehe.
Notice anything...  Different? Huh? Huh? A hint!
Can I watch you work?
Please?
Pretty please?
Hi Squidward!
I just finished cleaning the restroom!
I mopped the floors! I shined the mirrors! I scrubbed the sinks.
Oh yeah!  But we are going to need a new toilet plunger. This one's broken.
Hah hah! Squidward's funny!  Hey, a button!
You're the prettiest button I've ever... Huh? Monster!
It's after SpongeBob!  You're right button! No monster is going to eat our friend!
Squidward?  Did you know the monster was Squidward? Well when were you going to tell me?
Sorry, button.
Oh!!! AH HAH HAH HAH HAH!
Uhh. Such a tired day at the office.  Boy, am I famished, I sure wish I knew the best restaurant in Bikini Bottom.  From where has this glorious scent come?
Do you mind? Some of us have nothing to do tomorrow morning!
Guys, what did I tell you before? I'm trying to get some shuteye!
The hors d'oeuvres you left on the table.  Not bad.
X-rays tickle.
I don't know, but all of this failure is tiring me out. I'm just gonna take a nap on that rock right over there.
D'oh! Hey guys! What's shaking?  Oh...
Mmm! Freaky Clone Jelly Relish!
Uh, I'll have one Relish Patty. Hold the mayo.
"Free samples".  Yum!
Put him through.
Hey, buddy! You really need to get this place cleaned up.
Say no more, buddy!
Sandy, don't hang up!
Oh, nothing. I'm just hanging with the sponge. How about you?
Sounds like fun. I wish I was over there. SpongeBob's house is boring. There's nothing going on over here.
Oh, SpongeBob's pineapple is rotting and falling apart all around us... we're doomed.
Oh take your time...
I'm here because... wait a minute, why am I here? SpongeBob, I'm having another exit pencils crisis!
Wrong! A pineapple needs a sweet, but tangy flavor.
It's just not a house without a rock to sleep under.
I'm hungry.
I'm starving.
Mmmm, Spongecake.
Say no more buddy, I know just the thing!  Get comfy!
Okay. Once upon a time there was a sleepy little boy.
And the sleepy boy was the sleepiest boy in all the kingdom!
And one night he nestled in the bed for a long slumber. And Sir Cecil, The sea sleep king sprinkled him with mystical sleepy dust. He couldn't have been cozier. When, without warning, an exitable sea troll bursted through the window. "Wakey wakey sleepy doo!" He bellowed. Then suddenly he was whisked away by eagle-winged mollusks into the night skyyyy!
It's called "The Land of Perpetual Excitement" You know, It's a "get out of bed" story.
Hmmm... oh I know! I'll sing you a lullaby from my childhood! "Get up be active, Get up be active, Get up be active, GET UP BE ACTIVE! GET UP BE ACTIVE! GET UP BE ACTIVE! Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down! Get uup don't lie downnn!
Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down! Get up be active! Get up be active!
Get up be active! Get up be active! Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down!
Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down!
Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down! Get up don't lie down! GET UUP DON'T LIE DOWNNN!
Well, what, what, well, I don't know what you want from me, it's not like I have some magic wand to wave.  Or do I...
Hocus, pocus!
Abra zeptadra!
SpongeBob, I see you're serious about this now. I didn't want to do this, but I'm gonna let you in on a little family secret. Old grandma suffered from severe toe barnacles.
And she invented the secret elixir for just such an emergency. Drink up.
DRINK IT!
Coffee.
Oops..
Spongecake!
Thanks for having lunch with me, SpongeBob.
That's a pretty cool face.  Check you this one out.
Oh, hey, how about this?
Funny faces make me laugh!
Done and done.
Right, gotcha. No problem. Not gonna make faces. No faces... at all.
Huh, fine. You?
Dun ah eeh.
What?
Gosh, you're right.
You mean like this?  Ree eeh eeh!
Aye yi yi yi!
Phee!
Dun ree ah yee!
Ah ah ooh!
Aydh!
Looo ooo ooo!
Yes! But, now do you choose just one? Um, well, let's see. Oh, oh... How about an eye cross,  uh? And then slip into and overbite.  And the finishing touch. Gah lowh.
Gloriously disgusting, sir.
: Hey Spongebob!
: Hey SpongeBob!
: Hey SpongeBob!
Oh yeah? Watch me.
Actually, I can't move my face at all
All right! We did it!
Oh. Uhhh, is this a bad time, SpongeBob?
...a worthless piece of paper.  Hey, thanks, it's just what I needed, Squidward.  Nice shirt, SpongeBob.
I can't come out. SpongeBob I'm taking a shower.
Glove World!?
Look at that guy, he must be older.
Close Glove World!?! Has the world gone mad?!
Uh, it feels good.
It fits like a glove.
A penny saved is a penny gloved!
She gloves me, she gloves me not.
Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove! Glove.
For all time's right sake.
Goodbye Tilt-A-Hurl.
We'll miss you.
So many fun memories on this ride.
I think you know where pal.
Come on buddy. Let's take our seats.
Beats me. Let's go ride the Ferris Wheel.
Excuse me.
Oh no! What am I looking at?
Then you mean...
It's free from it's mornings!  SpongeBob what are you doing? We must remain seated in all times!
Wh-wh-wh-wh? You know I'm allergic to jumping! You know that!
I uh, oh if you say so.
Thanks!
That's really gonna spoil the residents of Glove Castle.
We've come this far why start now?
Ok.
Yeah, or on it's last finger.
I know what we can do. Let's take a trip to Glove World! and cheers us up.
It is?
We do?
I think so. Yeah i'm here.
SpongeBob, I'm not a stupid. Come one, come all, to the new, the improved...
Hall of Mirrors!
Mr.Owner Mr.Owner! Can I wear the glovey glove costume? Please, please? I just wanna try it on. And also this hat you let me earlier is turning to get little worn out. See?
Thanks!
Oh oh! Glove Ice cream!  Thanks!
I thought he gave it to me.
Come back here!
I'm just trying to test their strength with this giant hammer.
Yeah, it's the sound of total silence.  Plus tumbleweeds.
Well, there is one thing we can do.
Yeah brother! We're chaining ourselves, through a gate.
You bet!
What key?
Oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah, you told me to keep in the safe place remember?
At the bottom of Glove Lake. Where no one will eeeeeeeeeveeerr find it!  SpongeBob?
It's a trap! A trap for Santa!
I will trap Santa in my box, locked up like Fort Knox and make him stop the clocks. And then we'll have Christmas all year long!
Hey, a cookie!
I think it's pretty obvious, SpongeBob! I'm eating fruitcake and setting a tiger trap for Santa! Now, if you don't mind, I'm kind of busy right now.
Nosy-body. Yay, it works! Hello, big striped shrimp. [
Gotcha!
Oh, no! I knew this day would come! Invasion of the Giant Patties! There's only one thing to do! It's eat or be eaten!
Oh, no! The giant patty has eaten my buddy!
Cough him up, you monster! Come here, you!  Die, giant patty, die! Patties should not eat my buddy!
You okay, little buddy?
What's this
Well, this will never do! You gotta think bigger! Everyone should know about the... uh... Krusty Krab. We need an ad blitz of monumental proportions! Everywhere you look, you should see the name..the Krabby Klam.
Whatever!
Hold still! I'm almost through! Perfect!
Hold on to your shorts! I got it!
Ok, now turn around! Open wide!  Wider!  Perfect!  Ready?
I hired a skywriter! Oh, there he is now!
Somehow, I thought that would be more effective.
Hey, I can see my house from here!
Ooh, the Krusty Krab!
Huh! Oh, it's SpongeBob!  Hey, SpongeBob!
I agree!
Well, there's one place we missed. That big pile of roads!
Well, we're not playing! We're working!
I got this!
Your canvas awaits!
Based on a real treasure map.
Yeah! C'mon sweaty.
My turn.  Five.  One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm.  It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs.
But I don't even work here!
Boy, would I?!
I'm Blind Beard the Pirate.
I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...!  land...
Uhh... let's see, uhh...  that way captain!
Ooh! East? I thought you said "weast"!
This one, sir.
And hungry.
Don't cry, Captain Krabs.
I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.
I know.
Look! The treasure map.
Yeah...
Nothing.
I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that is there?
SpongeBob?
Did you notice something familiar about this map?
We're sorry.
I think that.
I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?
Gee Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.
Somebody left this thing laying around the parking lot.
Uh, Mr. Krabs? Where do I put this?
Then what about this?
Hey thanks again fellas! Nice guys like them don't come around much these days. They even redecorated the tour busmobile for us!
Uh...oh! Yeah, I can't.
Well...
Wow...you're good at guessing...
Or...they came to see the meteor shower that passes through the Aurora Borealis generating a stunning, once-in-a-lifetime light show.
A bit dry and flavorless. I'll take two dozen.
Um, could you give me a hand?
I can't see anything.
Whoa!
Wow!
Wow!
Whoa!
Did you see that?
Extreme spots? Well, that's no fair. You're already covers in extreme spots. Ooh. Hold on a second.  Okay, let's do meet our new heroes.
Hey! How'd we get up here?
Extreme!  Hey, who's holding the other end?
D'uh.  My best friend is SpongeBob, he has a square head, I try on his clothes while he's asleep in bed.
That's weird, my face is leaking.
Exercise?!  Eww, I didn't sign up for this!
I want a clean fight. I don't wanna see any trash laying around.  Oohh...We give up! Fling  That was close.
Even more brutal!
Dumpster diving!
How revolting.
That is one tough elderly person.
Hey, where are the Drasticals?  Here they come!
Amazing!
Who is that guy?
What the...? Oh hey, it's Solitaire! I love this game! I take a touchdown!
Oh yeah, well uh, you know what's sad? This.
No! You have a special hat. Which means you get to go to your special-happy-worky place. While I just stay...  bored all day. I want a special-happy-worky place too!
Uhhh...  Sand.
Think about it. Think, Patrick think. Hmmmmm... hmmpphh!  Thinking is painful.  Break time.
I gotta figure out what to do in my life.  Awww I wish I was a superhero.  I know what I want to do with my life! To the changing room!   Ahhhhh.  At last I have found my calling. I am Patrick-Man: defender of Bikini Bottom!
Fear not, Patrick-Man is here.
It's Patrick-Man, Mr. Krabs.
Must I explain everything? I found what I want to do with my life! I am Patrick-Man!!
Shush SpongeBob! My identity must be kept secret! My work here is done. Patrick-Man is off! The city needs my help!  Oh, I almost forgot, can I get a Krabby Patty?
Just remember this: Violence solves nothing!
No time for silly-talk, citizen. Patrick-Man is needed elsewhere!
Halt! Patrick-Man is on to you! Thief! Stealing is bad! Bad!
Nah, enough!!! This dollar shall stay on the sidewalk, where it belongs.  With Neptune's swiftness, away!
Sounds like another job for Patrick-Man!  I'll finish you off later, dale donuts. Right now I must move rapidly and act heroically!  What's this?  Don't move, and freeze!
Let's see you try to bust outta that, boat thief!
Jammed doors, huh?  A likely story. With Neptune's swiftness,  away!
Hey, that's Patrick-Man to you.
Something a non-hero civilian would never understand.  I'm about to unmask one of Bikini Bottom's biggest foes! Right here in the Krusty Krab. And I've intercepted his evil schemes!
Overboaaard??!! You call this overboard?! Away with Neptune's  Swiftness!  Villains and criminals, beware!  Patrick-Man is here!
And he always finds out who hides under the mask!
Oh, right.  Gotcha!
Admit it, masked marauder!
But I was about to unmask a supervillain!
Protecting Bikini Bottom from a scoundrel!
No way! [ Hey! Where'd he come from?
The Dirty Bubble? I wanted to unmask Man Ray.
SpongeBob, you're looking at a superhero. So naturally, I will rely on my superpowers,  and throw some stuff!
Take this, beast!
I've got him right where I want him. For the Pit Punch!
Lunch!
Why of course, young man. That's uh, SpongeBob with two 7s, right?
Actually,  it's Patrick to you.  I'm retiring. Having a job is too much work.
What's this?
Hey SpongeBob, Gary.
Confidentially, I'm just here for the free samples.Mmm, you can really taste the gourmet.Thank you, ma'am, I may consider purchasing this brand for my worms.Want some?
They're on aisle 3, next to the most delicious snail treats. Follow me!Here they are! Tasty Time snail treats.
Hey, guys, check this out!A Pet Point 3000!
It's so futuristic.Look, a red dot!Come back here!
I love this thing! Let's turn it up!Huh?Where did it go?
Huh? Oh, there it is. Hey, do you smell something burning?
How do like that, baby?
Yeah. it makes me feel baby-ish. Oh, Look at me I'm a baby.
He's mumbling and drooling like a little baby
Hang in there buddy. we'll fix you up in no time.
Hey little Squidward. Ready to have some fun.
Thanks for sharing baby
Games? Games are our middle name.
He does.
Don't worry. I got this.
Don't worry he'll be settled down in couple of minutes.
Taking care of a baby sure is hard
How much do you need?
Nope.
Show me what you got at Glove World!!
Wow...
I got gloves for my glove action-figure!
Hey, SpongeBob?
Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?
We just passed the sign. 'You are now in leaving Bikini Bottom'.
What's wrong SpongeBob?
Where is this, SpongeBob?
Bob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart.
I still can't read the signs. I wanna go home.
Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here.  SpongeBob...!
Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya!
Hey, SpongeBob...
Do you know how to swim?
Me neither.
Oh.  Hey, you're floating too! What happened?
It's all purple and sticky.
Well, the smell makes my nose tickle.  Hey, it bounces!
Sorry!
Yeah, but with visual aids.
I can fit it in my mouth. Oh, it tastes like liquorice.
No, not really. I drifted off.
Or an awesome toupe.
Seems safe to me.
Yeah, these goo bubbles won't bounce themselves.
It's awesome.
Sandy's really getting out of hand.
Oh, I want to play the drum!
Oh, fine. Here. I don't need that old stick anyways.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, they shine!
I'll catch up! I've gotta use the can!
Help, help! Help!  I'm out of toilet paper in here!
Help!
Howdy, SpongeBlob! I'm so glad you could  around.  Glad.
Oh, go rescue somebody else. Can't you see I'm playing with my friend, SpongeBlob?  Don't worry. I'll never leave you.  Huh?  No...! Good-bye, SpongeBlob!  Hi, SpongeBob! Hi, Sandy!
Hey again, SpongeBlob!
Good thing we landed on SpongeBob.
Plankton, you're-- you're a big meanie-weenie! You won't be such a tough guy without that big old bubble!
Really?  Do I need deodorant?
Bubbles. That's your answer for everything.
Whoo!  Oh, boy! Get him, you big bubble bruiser!  Whoo!  You're the man! Yay!
What?! SpongeBob SquarePants, we have been friends for a long time, and you've asked me to do some crazy things over the years. Breaking into a bank?  Has to be the coolest!
Okay. First we climb up the walls.  Then, we slide down the chimney and eat up all the milk and cookies they left out for us!
Luckily, I brought the bank breaking kit! Um. How about this?
It's as close as I'll ever get to having shoes.
Hey, SpongeBob! I got an idea! Let's use this grappling hook!
Let's get him!  COOL! Let's do that again!
This lock won't know what hit it!
Oh, right!  I'll use the finesse.
We've been rumbled! Run! Scatter! Scamper! Save yourself!
And he'll fry them into fish sticks! I can't watch! Is the scary part over?
See if it's safe.
Oh, dang. We hardly even saw it.
No problem.
I'm on it.
What?! Not again!
But that's when the Fisherman comes out!
I guess we showed that old horror movie who's boss.
It's like we're heroes.
Wait a second. Y-You mean, I gotta walk all the way home alone?
Darn old horror movie. Why couldn't we watch a cartoon instead?  Do you hear that?
We can't get home.
Thanks, Squidwar...
Uh, hello? Someone there?Uh, uh?What's that? There's something stuck... Huh. Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah. That's the spot. A little to the left. Oh, yeah. All right. Right there.
The Fisherman!
Uh, someone's here?
What about this? (Patrick holds Gary)
Maybe if we don't look at him he'll go away.
Not our bestest buddy! We gotta save him! Okay, with 33. I need you to go long. You're going down, Fisherman!
Okay.
What? Come on, bossman! If we can't eat anything, why are we here?
Then can we eat some furniture?
But where's Rusty?
A big ghost?! I thought we were- we were conjuring a rib roast! I'm outta here!  I'll get help buddy! Just get me away from this freak!
That good enough for ya?
Sorry SpongeBob, but this is the part of the story where I run away again only this time I don't know where to run to, so I'm just gonna go circling around the building
Wow!  Oh, that'd be like me forgetting to-- Oh! Oh, oh, oh... Oh, there you are, pocket taco.
No.
This, uh, is getting creepy.
:  Sweet Neptune! Uh, SpongeBob,uh, I'm going to gonow. Your obsession with Kenny is getting weird.
Oh, that's okay. See you, SpongeBob!
Hiya SpongeBob!  Whatcha doin'?
Fly away, little critter!
Maybe it's just a squirrel thing..
Arrrgh! Get them off me! Get them off me!
Do you think she knows the Muffin Man song?
Well, let's get some Texas and bring it down here!
Where?
Wait until she sees the...
Yeah. What's so great about dumb ol' Texas?
Texas is dumb?
Then can we say people from Texas are dumb?
I'm Texas too! Get a dog little longie! Get a dog!
Get a dog little longie! Get a dog!
Uhh, stupid?
What's the difference?!
Krusty Krab, here we come!  Can we say that plants from Texas are dumb? Can we say that shoes from Texas are dumb?
Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna...
SpongeBob!
For you!
Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas?
Should I start running now?
Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I heard you crying and it made me sad.
Hi, SpongeBob! Why are you making me so sad?
Free French fries?
Fried Frittatas?
Frothy frappe?
I can't think of any more food that starts with the letter "c", SpongeBob.
Hey, that's great! Being unemployed is the best gig I know!  I tell you what. Meet me tomorrow morning, and I'll introduce you to the wonders of the unemployed lifestyle.
Great. See you then.
Oh!  Hey, buddy! Are you ready? Ready for your first day of glorious unemployment? Or as I like to call it, "fun-employment"!
That's the spirit!  Now, the first stop on our tour of fun-employment is a healthy breakfast with our good friend Mr. Squidward.  Hey, Squidward! How are you this fine morning?
I'll just save this for later.  Now you try.
Hey, you're good at this. Next on our i-tin-er-ary, a brief mid-morning siesta.
Are you feelin' any better yet?
Come on, SadPants. You know what always picks me up?
Free lunch with friends!
Oh, boy, lunch!
Here ya go, little buddy.  Ahh. Mmm!
Hey! You can't talk to my friend like that!
Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. You need to follow your heart.
Yeah, this is dee-licious! Does it have any side effects?
There's always a shortcut!
Same way I always do. Scott gave me a ride in his pedicab.
: I'm here for lunch.
:  Yes!
:  Yes, sir!
: Mmm, Quadrants!
:  These guys talk funny words.
: I guess I'll have one of these business sandwiches everybody's talking about.
: Is that what you call it?
: Oh, wow! I'll take seven!
: But I never wanted anything so much in my whole life! Since this morning when I wanted a donut-night at the "Donut" and it was great! The donut is gone!  The donut is gone!
: Now, where's my executive treatment?
: Will the tie let me order the executive treatment?
:  Well, I'd be stupid not to!
: Here's your 20 bucks.
: Thanks! I'll take one executive treatment my good man.
: Oh man!  It looks executively delicious!
: But! But!  Save my sandwich for me, Squidward! Squidward!
: No!  No!!!  No!!!  Not 4-B!!! NO!!!!!
: Hed be given a sandwich and sent on his way?
: I think Ive forgot to water my manatee oranges?
:  Where am I?
: A sandwich?
:  No I dont!
: What if I had a meaningless chart?
: Oh, wait!  And heres a little house with smoke coming out of the chimney. See what I mean?  I guess he likes my chart, 'cause hes smiling.
: Do you slap your palms down on the table like that too?
:Oh.
: Well, uh, lets see. Uh, dont tell me! I-I know its not sandwiches. They dont get sandwiches. Do they?
:  And so in conclusion, I would like to submit my official report.
: You do?
: Oh, yeah? Well, Ive got a surprise for you.  You cant fire me! Im not an executive at all! Im just a guy who happens to like sandwiches! So, go ahead! Send me away forever as a corporate spy if you want to! But not before I've had my say!
: Who is it?
: Hi, SpongeBob.
: Yeah. Well, its pretty nice I guess.
: Nuh-uh.
: Oh, wait! Oh, is that what I think it is?!
: Lets go home, SpongeBob.
Ha. Whatcha doing, SpongeBob?
Huh. Well, what about those baby snails?
They're over here.
Feed 'em to who?
My mouth is warm.
Oh.
So... I guess I'll be going then.
Hey, SpongeBob! This guy found this snail in his garden and he didn't know what to do. So, I told him how you take care of snails.
That's a pretty good thing I thought of. Huh? Well...
Well, if it's snail friends he wants, it's a snail friend he's gonna get.
Meow.
It's Patrick! Um, Meow!
Meow, no! No, meow!
Meow, help! Meow, help!
Bye, SpongeBob.
I'll just have 47 Krabby Patties please. I had a big breakfast so I'm not that hungry.  Squidward did you get a new haircut?
I isn't Patrick?
I like the first part but I don't understand the second part.
Ah! Oh no that's gonna hurt!
I like to eat!
Ha-ha-ha, you said tummy.
I like whistles!
Gotta warm up my taste buds first.
Oh, faster?
Oh, why didn't you say so.
I don't
His homework?
I don't get to taste?
Hey.
SpongeBob, I don't wanna do this.
I don't want to eat in the contest it hurts my taste feelings.
What's that?
But I didn't know I had to pay!
Okay, i'll do it for the little boy with the hurt foot.
It's over SpongeBob, I can't go on.
The taste.
No, this thing doesn't even fit!
I don't get it! What's an audit?
I am rolling the dice!  Now I am moving!  "Run...Spreadsheets"?
Well, maybe I'm supposed to run around with this sheet we spread on the ground!
I don't think this game is ripe.
Doesn't everything grow on trees?
Makes them?
Then I could make a game?
Yeah! The opernive... word is think!  Thanks, Squidward! I'll do it!
I invented a game! I invented a game!
Well, you know how hard "Tic-Tac-Toe" is and how it always takes so long to play?
Yeah! Well, I made it easier and faster!
It's called...  "Tic-Tac"! You start with two lines that are crossed. And then the first person puts an X. And then the next person puts an, uh...
Oh, yeah! An O! And the first person to get two in a row draws a line through them and says, "Tic-Tac"!.  You start!
Uh...  Best two out of four?
I should've gone with my first idea: "Tic".
Squidward, I got a new game! It's called "Rock, Paper, Butter"!
Squidward, I got it!  Whose rope is longer? You...  Aww! You played this before!
Sandy, I've been trying to invent a game, but every game I invent is a failure.
I know what to do!
And so it begins.
It's a game! It's a game! Now I know what it's like to be a game maker!
Good evening. Please step into my gamatourium.
Welcome, gamers! And behold!  My game!
No, my friend. We have only just begun.
It's called... Patrick! The Game!
Alright!  I'll explain the rules. Each player picks a piece to move around the board. The way you decide which player gets to pick the piece by rolling the dice.  To decide who gets to roll the dice first to see who gets the first choice of players, you have to be...
You mean for picking our player or for starting the game?
Ok! Now, onto rules of how to play the game.
Hmm...  Okay!  Oh, money!!
Oh, on your next turn, you roll then you can move down the board or you can go round the race track as many times as you rolled.
You go to jail.
My turn!  One... two...
Oh, you don't get to roll when you're in jail.
You have to roll a six.
Hey! You can't roll the dice when you're in jail!
Ah, here it is!  The guy that is in jail has to stay there unless he rolls a six or someone says his name.
Oh boy! You landed on "Do a Surgery"!  Now, pick a surgery card.
Now, sit back down, you criminal!
No wait, Squidward!
Wait, how'd he get out of jail?
Jail for Squidward!
Tell it to the judge!
Starving! Starving sea star time!
If a person declares outsidies, then everyone must go outside.
Four. We are in a giggle zone! Everyone laugh!
Not so fast!  No player may declare himself "Automatic Winner."
Game over!
Hey man!
Ooh! I could use a mint! Mmm!
That doesn't sound tasty.
Natural greeting returned.
Oh, yes. Please.
Hey, did we do good?
Oh! Oh! Yeah!  I want an A+ too!
Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty please?
I knew it!
Yeah?
Oh! It's like a dream!
Hey, yeah. Whatever he said.
We're an awesome team!
I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.
Uh, the first one?
I'm in charge.
I'm in charge.
Two.
I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.
Uh. Huh? What?
I don't know if I wanna do it this way.
Uh...
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotcha.
Forty-eight, forty-... nine,  Oh! Oh, fifty!
Oh boy! Let's go!
Um. Uh. Your.. your bowl is bigger!
Yeah.
You got more ice cream!
Well, I wanna trade back!
There's only one fair thing to do.
I'm in charge!
I'll take those my good man.
I'm in charge.
Hmmm...  Rub my feet first!
Who's in charge?
Oh... I'll fix that.
Don't you back-sass me! I'm in charge and you have to do what I say! Now, count that bucket of white sand.
Oh, that's a pity.
Looks like you'll have to start over.
Yes I am.
Hey!
You're not leaving until I say so!
You heard Sandy! Open the door!
No, you open it!
Mr. Pavlovi, tell SpongeBob to open the door!
I was a monster! I deserve a Z-!
I blame science! Stupid science!
Huh, hee, whooah-oh-hoo-hoo...!
Hooray! I win!
I declare a thumb war!
Huh?
Now that was a great thumb war, mister!
Gee, thanks, SpongeBob. That means a lot.
Uh, sorry, SpongeBob.
Uh, yeah, I guess. I probably won't even be able to do good flipping.
Uhhhhhh, turn over.
The job's taken.
Just how are you gonna do that?
Ungaw!
Admit it! You have been bested!
Then prepare to be pinned!
It's okay, I hate work anyway.
No really, I do hate work!  Everybody's laughing! Oh hey SpongeBob, I got something for ya!
We saved the rec center!
Life is but a walking shadow. Ha-lube-lube-lube-lube-lube... []
What?
But my home's not for sale.
Sold? Where am I gonna live now?
It's a forever hike.
Yeah. All because of Nick Fishkins.
He shows up on television, and buys your home and there's nothing you can do about it.  Now I am doomed to walk the seas without a home.
Wow!
Don't forget to make a garage for our new boat!
Hi, Squidward!
Cause Nick Fishkins bought my home and then he bought SpongeBob's home.
Well, he hasn't paid us yet!
Really weird!
Maybe I can move in with whoever's in my house.
A rock band?
Cause my house is a rock?
And I could learn what "learn" is.
Hey, SpongeBob.
I missed my house, and I was hoping I could move back in.
What do you play?
There's no such thing!
Prove it!
That was great! You should give lessons to my ex-neighbor, Squidward! He stinks!
What's going on?
They need a band. I'll go talk to the guys that live in my old place, and see if they can come over to play along!
So...is Nick Fishkins gonna live in my house?
He flips houses for a living?
I know!
That was Nick Fishkins.
He said "Yeesh! Who'd wanna live in that thing? Not sold!"
Digging.
Hmm, I don't know.
He's in the house. He's impressed.
I don't know, but it must have been pretty good to make him cry like that.
It must have been pretty good to make him cry like that.
No, no, just
It's harder to walk, but worth it.
So many flavors.
No, that's too fancy.
With real rocks!
Krabby Patties: They taste so nice, that they taste nice.
I'm already a star.
Hey, SpongeBob, now that I'm finished doing whatever it is I'm doing, you wanna go play?
SpongeBob!
Oh, I'm sure glad you made it to my party.
Oh, I don't know.
Aww.
"Tastes so nice that they"
Oh, now I gotta start over! Ooh, someone fix that broken robot.
"Tastes so nice that they taste nice."
But he's my friend.
What am I doing again?
Tastes so nice, it... uh...  blah, blah, blahblahbli-blah...
See you later, SpongeBob.
That's it. I can't take it anymore. Everybody out!
I wish things could go back to the way they were. Mm...  I just wanna be able to share one pair of pants with my best friend without it being in the papers.
SpongeBob!
SpongeBob, what?
I thought they tasted familiar!
SpongeBob?
I missed you too.
No, no, I don't wanna eat another one of those things!
Mm! Now that's a real Krabby Patty! Oh, as delicious as our real friendship.
But I have to speak at a shareholders meeting tonight. How am I gonna say nice things about frozen patties now that I know they're filled with sand?
Good evening, ladies and... the other ones. I know you're all excited to see the 400th commercial, but before we see it, I just want to say...
That... that...Frozen Krabby Patties are...
...Made with sand!
A friend always helps. It's called "frelping," and I was very frelpful.
Yeah, we just give them away.
Watch this.
Yeah, it's only, um...  June o'clock.
Good, we can use the wood.
Okay. Hmm.
Try what?
I know.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!
Can I have some more?  It's hard to eat off this side of me.
Thanks, Sandy!
Hey, Sandy!
I want more Nutty Butter.
Oh.  They licked the Nutty Butter off my back.  And now they're here for more.
Uh huh.
Uh. Well, it's like Sandy said, "Something, something, something, science." And who are we to argue with science?
Hold on! I got this!
And I'll never forgive her if she runs out of Nutty Butter!
Don't worry. I made more Nutty Butter with the rest of the nuts.
I didn't know there was gonna be a test!
Hello!
Hey, that's me!
But I wasn't com...
Oh, yeah. He's cool because He's a nanny-mouse.
What's wrong?
Oh, I think they were all good things.
Well, he probably meant his stomach was dark and empty and he was hungry for more.
You were Fry-Banshee?!
Well, maybe he just thought it was funny. And... and when he said that Krabby Patties taste like old baseball gloves...
Oh, not yet!
No, I'm not.
Well, that's what my last note was about, SpongeBob. I was upset that people take everything I say the wrong way.
Yeah, I think.
What a ride!
Mr. Krabs!
I spy with my little eye...
Oh ho! Yes! Yes!
Mr. Krabs?
The world's least exciting sweater! My parents fell in love there! We gotta go!
Hey!
You did it wrong, Squidward.
It was an accident that it fell into my mouth!
100%.
I don't wanna be a hog. I'll just eat what's leftover.
Hey, SpongeBob. You look tired. You want me to guard the patty for a bit?
I can't believe you thought I would eat it!
But I'm hungry!
Ow!
Oh boy!
Hunger!
Mmm! Krabby Patty!
The Krabby Patty won! It won!
Hey, SpongeBob! I can't believe you can actually fly like you said in your letter!
Duh!
Dying? Oh, oh! You didn't read the whole letter!
And here's the second page! "To see you as a real pilot, SpongeBob. Here are some other things I like to see: candy rain, a firetruck full of clowns, and... a bunch of other stuff."
You thought I was dying!
Watch out!
Candy rain, check!
Firetruck clowns, check!
Fly first class, check!
Take what now?
Whoo-hoo! Check and check!
I am!
No, wait.
Uh, don't worry! I've got this!  Yep!
Thanks for helping me finish my list, SpongeBob.
Really? Well, if you don't mind, I have a couple of other things I'd like to see.
"An edible balloon, a skateboarding snail, a tower of loose meat that tastes like ice cream, some ghosts..."
I don't understand the question.
Uh, hey. No running in the halls!
Mmm! Stickerific!
Oww!
I have a headache inside of my tooth!
Okay, I will!
Well, now that my all over hurts, I'm not thinking about my mouth.  Ow! I guess that didn't work!
No way! I've heard horror stories!
Aww, darn it.
Slow down, SpongeBob! This place is scary enough without you going crazy with the beads!
No problem. I was just leaving.
I still have a baby tooth?
That's not right!
You leave my baby tooth alone, you monster!
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do with my baby tooth! This tooth is staying in my mouth!
Tooth Island?
I don't care, SpongeBob! I know what's best for my tooth! I can make it happy.
Rock a bye baby on the treetop
Oops.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Nothing! Just, uh, practicing being a seal!
Ow!
Okay, SpongeBob. I guess I have to get my tooth to the Tooth Fairy.
Who's got baloney?
That's okay, SpongeBob. I think I can manage.
You'll have to catch me first!
The worms!
Not wanted. That fixes it.
You may have called off your worms, but I'm not coming down!
A likely story!
What's that?
I thought you kept them in the scrapbook!
Okay, SpongeBob. We can go.
I'm ready, Doc. Do what you have to do.
That's it?
You're going under my pillow so you can go to Tooth Island my sweet boy!
SpongeBob?
Oh, SpongeBob!
How can I believe you? All the lies!  The chicanery!
There really is a Tooth Ferry!
Could you wait 'til I'm asleep and put it under my pillow?
Hey! Where do you think you're going, chum chewer?
Hey SpongeBob, look what it says here.  Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease but all have failed.
Uhh!
Rude. Hey, the light changed.
Hold on, almost there.
He is the new royal fry cook and you...
Is it hot in here or what?
Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any...  Ouch.
Only two? What are two challenges to someone like SpongeBob?
Three?   Three challenges is nothing. Might as well make it 500 challenges!
He'll settle for one.
SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!  SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!
Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?
Hey, that sounds pretty good.
Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: "Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds." Well, just look at me now.  Go get 'em, tiger!
It was nice knowing you, buddy!
Good morning, Krusty Krew.
Now you.
Yes, SpongeBob?
Two sticks?! That's against the rules! You can't change the rules, SpongeBob, just because I'm winning!
No, I want it!
No, I want it!
I want it! I want it!
Sorry to hear about your TV, SpongeBob.
Oh!
Boo!
And the propeller tickles my think folds!  Hey, hey, hey, SpongeBob! Eye bump!
I feel you.
Well, maybe he fell in the toilet. I'll check!
Squidward, are you in here? Did you fall in? Squidward!
Yep, that's him! Hi, Squidward!
She spit in his face!
I thought we were the first kids on the block to get whirly brains!
Get ready, get set, punch it!
Only the dismal abyss of black nothingness.
M-O-O-N.  That spells moon!
I'm taking it easy, SpongeBob.
Here, brains!
Brain, brain, brain! I think I found it, SpongeBob!
Yeah, my brain won't fit back in.
I'll take it!
Oh, yeah! Lookin' good!
Aww, man! That felt all squishy!
Okay. SANDY!
My think is clogged.
Yay!
You're right!
Only something, Mermaid Man! You can't mean...
We're watching you!
Yeah. You'd better do something or whatever.
Mermaid Man, our hero! Barnacle Boy, you too!
Evil found its match today! Underwater justice and fair play!
I heard him say something negative!
Mermaid Man, that injured victim's bandages have come undone!
You did a great job with casting.
Yeah. Not bad. But next time, we won't go so easy on ya!
Hmm. Nope.  Ah.
What? Oh, hi, Patrick. What's shaking?
Sounds good to me, "me."
You can't fool me, "me." That's the worst SpongeBob impression I've ever seen.
You leave my best friend alone!
Why?!
That went well!
Good, SpongeBob! I had the same answer.
Mmm! Mmm!
I like cooking with lard!
Hello?
Ah! It's a monster with SpongeBob's voice!
Fire in the hole!
Hey, that's great!
Tell my parents I love them.
That was sheer beauty.
SpongeBob? What's happening?
Oh, yeah. I should probably...
This isn't my rug! Wherewhere am I? Who am I?  Who am I?  How am I?
Oh, yeah.  Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie. Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie.
Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie, Ruggie!  Wake up, little Squidward, wake up!
Oh, we'll have to create another Squidward in the lab.
Eureka!
Ooh, we've tried everything under the ocean and we failed! If only we could just crawl up inside Squidward and play him like a puppet.
Oh, whose dumb idea was that?
Well, it sounds good to me.
Okay.
Eww.  It tickles.
Not bad. Okay, get on my shoulders.
Wow, you sound more like him thanthan Squidward!
One second.
Oh, I got it.
I guess I never actually thought of the moment where we'd have to play it.
What's going on?
Me neither, SpongeBob!
Hey, kids, I'm a
Uh, um.
A rock.
They tore off my head.
This place is so shiny.
Fancy foods! Get your fancy foods here!
I love delicious stuff. My turn!
Yummy.
Mine!
Mine, mine!
Mine, mine!
Ahh! Oh, behind me! Oh, get away!
Oh. Thanks!
I'm happy, SpongeBob!  Can someone get me out of here?  Whew!
But I can't fit through there.
Ahh!
Can someone get me out of here?
Thanks! I like...um...your antennas.
Hey, SpongeBob? Do you think this is working?
Hey SpongeBob!  You're in your underwear. That's cool.  I got your mail. What is it?
Oh boy, life insurance!!  Life insurance, life insurance, life insurance, life insurance!  What's life insurance?
This contract tastes legitimate, but I don't believe it!
Huh. Well finally, something I'm good at!
I've become unbreakable!
Ooh!
You got a sea spider on your head.
Okay.  Squidward was wrong. Didn't hurt him, just made him disappear.
My turn!  I'm losing my footing!  Oof! I've survived a deadly fall unhurt!
Turn the volume up inside of your voice!
Sea spider!
Sting me, sting me, sting me!
Zap me with your pain juice!
Yeah! To test out the life insurance, we even built a super dangerous obstacle course across the street!
Actually, you better take two, since you kind of a klutz.
You're untouchable!
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
You can't be hurt!
Mm-mmm.
It's not?
Now I'm yelling too!
Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now.
Catch!
Good morning!
Hmm, how much is it?
Sounds reasonable.  Uh, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter.
Ah, one quarter.
Uh, very well, then. Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter?  Thanks.
Oooh.  Ah!
It's a giraffe!
Technique.
Squid is number one!
Yeah, technique.
Good morning, Krusty Krew.
Guess what? The carnivals in town. Come on, let's go.
It's not leaving. It's just taking a break.  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni...  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town.  I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier.
Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!
Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it.
SpongeBob, let me ask you something.  Does this look dangerous?
Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel...
Am I ever. You should try it.
You just jump off before you get too high.
Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey?
Wheeee.
Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away!
Ready.
Again?
I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down.
Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way.
You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!
Well, I had my fingers crossed.
Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.
Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm going to go have some fun.  Come on SpongeBob. You know you want to.
Hello? Does somebody have a can opener?
Hey, SpongeBob. You look so sparkly today.
Oh.  No! My ice cream! Ooh, why is the world so full of pain?
Ahhh! Best day ever!
Boo!
An ice cream geyser!
Brain freeze! I can't eat it all! Ah, I've never been more disappointed in myself.
Save us, SpongeBob! Save us! No wait.  Okay, now save us!
Oh, SpongeBob, I wouldn't say that.
Ow! Okay, SpongeBob, you ruined everything.
Birthday happy.
Poke.
Poke. Poke.
Poke. Poke. Poke.
Hmmm... pointy.
Hey, SpongeBob! What's up?
Yeah, I was leaving under watering my plant.
Really?!  How many gallons are wasting when we leave a sinking shower running?
Now what, SpongeBob?
Hey, SpongeBob, wanna see my new shoes?
Uh...  Wouldn't you rather see them on...  My hands?
Uh, actually... I have a confession to make.  I don't know how to tie my shoelaces.
Yes.
Gosh... Probably not.
Are you sure you know how to do it?
Your shoes are still untied.
I'm sorry!  I won't interrupt anymore!
No.
What was that? Are you okay, SpongeBob?
Oh, poop deck, You're right!  We'll have to do this lesson   later! Bye SpongeBob!
Oh, hi, SpongeBob.
Hey, SpongeBob... You're shorter. Have you been dieting?
Brush, brush, brush! Brushing everywhere!
Come again, sir!
Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward!
It's too bad they're old.
No, this is Patrick.
No, this is Patrick!  I'm not a Krusty Krab.
Who are you people?!
Uhh...
Uhh...
Uhh...
Uhh...  Okay! I've got it.
Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum?
Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
Aaaah! Let us out!
No!
Hi.
Ahh!
Hooray!
Hi, SpongeBob.
Yes, I am.
I don't either. Maybe it's the way you're dressed.
Maybe it's your voice.
Well, maybe it's just because you're ugly.
Better try the reflection test.
Ugly.
SpongeBob, can I borrow some bath beads?  SpongeBob?
Sure they would! It makes them feel better about the way they look! Maybe a story will cheer you up.  It's called, 'The Ugly Barnacle.'  Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died! The end.
As long as I can remember. You poor ugly thing, you.
Just do what I do when I have problems.  Scream!  Come on buddy I'll help you.  Okay now, say it.  Say it.
SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest.
Say it. Say it.
You're ugly and what...?
No. Proud.
Good! Say it louder.
Louder.
Louder!
So whaddya wanna do now?
People respect self esteem.
Don't worry about him, SpongeBob. He's just a-  SpongeBob? SpongeBob, what's wrong?
What is wrong with you people?!  Afraid to look ugliness in the face?  Well, here! Look at it!  It's ugly, isn't it?!  You look at it!
You look at it!
Look at it!  Look at it! Look at it! Look at it! I want all of you to look at it!
I bet there's no line at the snack bar.  Hello...? Hello...? They must be on break.
That looks great!  Oh, I gotta go to the restroom!  I'm out of soap, can I borrow-
I just want some-
My hands aren't that dirty...  Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?
Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!
Wouldn't you like to know?
Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly!  What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!
That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me!  I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do.
What's my mom gonna say?
Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes, or even bad hair, but...
Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief...
Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...
Well, I had some of your sundae.
Whatcha mean?
Stink?
Yes?
Don't be a silly head!  See? I told you not to-  Get it off me!  It's got me in its death grip!
Haha. Jellyfish, beware! Patrick Star is here. Jellyfish. Oh, how do you hold this again?  There. Got ya!  This isn't over! Hey, I'm not done with you.  I could really use SpongeBob's jellyfishing expertise right about now.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.  Apply the sauce.  I... Will not... Be separated... From... This... surfboard!  Rock! Separate, separate!
I wanna try! I wanna try!
Oooooohhh.
I feel so floaty! Hey, why are we, huh?
Hey, SpongeBob, if you were a god like Neptune here what would you do?
Ditto.
An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award.  Jellyfish, I got an award.  Island, I got an awar...  I gotta show SpongeBob.
Hey, SpongeBob, guess what? I got an award.
See for yourself.
SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.
But, it's shiny.
Ice cream!
I can find it. Is it in here?
I want an award.
I'm never gonna get an award because I haven't done anything.
That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.
Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!
I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!
Doctor?
Fireman?
A job at the Krusty Krab?
Then let's go.
Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.
Do I get my award yet?
Tartar sauce.
Do I get my award, now?
Ok.
Like that?
Barnacles!
Ai Yai, Captain
No, this is Patrick.
No! this is Patrick!
No! This is Patrick!  I'm not a Krusty Krab.
Huh? Oh, Fishpaste!
What's the point? I can't do anything right.
Why can't I do anything right?!
I'm never going to get an award, now.
Yes.
Ow, it burns!
Exactly as you do. Oh, no, I broke it!
I did?  Touchdown! I'm jarmaster!
Yeah. Remember when I had my up? And I put it on the lid?
Then I took the lid off and I thought I broke it.
But I didn't. I opened the jar with my hand. And it was all because you showed me how to do it. I'm never gonna forget this.
Good morning, SpongeBob.
Yup. If I'm gonna be an award winner, I've gotta dress like one.
Well, back to the ol' grind.
Uhh, me, too.
Uhh, me, too.  Ow!
Yes.
So I can win an award like you.
Stop it.
Thanks.
At least I'm safe inside my mind.
There's no award for that.
Until I have as many awards as you.
No, we won't.
Me, too.
Oh, no, you don't!
Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you.
My turn!
What's so great about being a Big Pink Loser?  Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.
Patrick's not here!
Oh, great!  What's it for this time?
Yay!  Eee!
I'm gonna go protect my title.
Is that really the  origin of King Neptune?
You want some?
Aww, but they're so cute.  Oh, hey there, mama jellyfish.
I think I might need that.
I'm on it.
Community service. It's a long story.
GO! GO! GO!
That's difficult to imagine, but I'd like to see us try.
Naah, I'm good.
What?
Ooh!  Ow!
It's just my new dance move. I'll call it... "the horrible mistake".
Bikini Bottom Legends. It's a chapter called "Things to do when encountering a legendary creature". It says to be polite.  Offer a gift, oh.
Yeah?
Yeah, it is.
SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Ericcson Day! Yingin-hinga- dinga!
Well, where could they be?
Frozen Krabby Patties are...
I think he means you, SpongeBob.
Krabby Patties taste so nice, um, that they taste nice.
Come here!
I can try.
Oh, oh, Krabby Patties taste so nice, that they taste nice!
Krabby Patties taste so nice, that...!
That they taste nice!
They taste nice!
You know, SpongeBob. Krabby Patties taste so nice, that they taste nice!
Yay!
This ain't your grandma's Krabby Patty!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I also have a name!
Teasing isn't nice.
No. I love 'em 'cause they're popular.
Hey, that was mine!
Mine!
And one sponge and one sea star!
I don't get it.
You're right! My ears! They're gone!
Oh, yeah.  That was a close one!
We stayed out in the sun so long, that I turned pink!
You're right. I should really invest in some sun block.
Whoa... That is-
It's-
Nuts! Haha!
I'm not a big fan of waterfalls... I prefer to stick to the rivers and lakes that I'm used to.
You can't tell from the picture, but that whole mountain is made of sugar.
No? Then, what have I been putting in my coffee?
Uh, bless you.
This Halloween, I'm gonna dress up like Patrick.
That's why they'll never know its me.  It's brilliant!
Is mayonnaise an instrument?
How do you make a ball out of feet?
Uh, Patrick.
I'm not Patrick?
Well, where's Patrick? What have you done with me?!
SpongeBob, my eyes! I'm seeing double!
Hey, he must be one lucky guy.
...SpongeBob, they're spitting into my mouth! Ugh, this is probably how landlions feed their young.
Uh, do they jump in the fountain and splash each other and play Marco Polo?  Do they? Do they?
Oh, I didn't even know it was a building!
Uh, I don't know.
You're welcome.
Hey, how come I'm not in this one?
You know what's weird? When I was taking my siesta, I dreamed you were at this building.
He understands me. It's almost like we share the same brain.
To our fallen comrades.
It is what's inside that counts.
I wish I had a little sea star inside of me.
And wasn't much of a cuddler either.
I would make a bad ballet dancer because I can't stand on my toes.
Oh! What?
I know this one! It's the Eiffel Tower!
She's a beauty. She is... trs belle!
Oh, don't worry, SpongeBob. Happens to me all the time. They grow back.
Oh, I can totally do that! I could!  I don't have to talk! Ha, just watch me. Not gonna talk!  I'm not talking now!
I'd never been on top of the water before! I got sea star sick.
It looks just like the one in New York City.
Crabmeat is delicious!
I am?
I am a star! Mr. SquarePants, I'm ready for my close-up!
It's a rule there.
I'm pretty sure it is.
They're in the monkey business?
It was not filled with hamburgers as one might expect.
False advertising.
A castle? With a pretty princess?
A..An ugly princess?
I like to boogie!
But does it...
Ok.
He was nice!
He was nice to me.
Oh, it's a birthday for me! It's a birthday for me! And it is so happy! Because it's...
Right! It's me!  It's my birthday! And it is happy!
I think the question is "Did it see us?"
No. The lions are scary.
SpongeBob, that just means they're hungry. Come on!
I don't believe in walruses. I just believe in me... and you SpongeBob.
Oh, to carry their keys!  And snacks!
If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere!
Uh-huh. You said is, SpongeBob. One of a kind.
If you're interested, have your people talk to our people.
My favorite ride was the Devil's Drop!
Hello, SpongeBob!
We are all moving North! We can't live here anymore! It's too hot!
Pet-sitting? Won't that hurt them?
No, that's Italian, SpongeBob.
Kitchie-kitchie koo, koo.
You found me!
Gee, SpongeBob, I don't want today to end ever.
Why must the sun set on this perfect day? Sleep well, Wormy.
Me too!  And then we're gonna play tag and then we're gonna color and then we're gonna build a house of cards!
Wormy? Where's Wormy? What's that thing?
He left his "Best Friend" ribbon behind!
What is that thing?
Why does this keep happening to me?!
Now what? We're trapped in here with that...that--"Best Friend Eater."
I am?
Or worse, it might eat Sandy's pets.
It's for you!
Tartar sauce.
SpongeBob! Hurry up with that net!
I really don't taste that good, Mr. Monster.
He's gonna eat Squidward and Mr. Krabs!
Just like it ate Wormy!
I'll never forget you, Wormy.
Pretty scary, huh?
Mr. Krabs?
Aye-aye, captain.
Gotcha.
Monster on the loose!
Attention, Bikini Bottom! There's a flying monster that's going to eat you!
About the what?
Yes sir! Just like a genie!
My head is saying yes, but my tummy is saying no. And I always trust my tummy, so, no.
You'll find the answer in your heart. Or, is it butt?
I have one answer, and one answer only.  Applesauce.
Ask later. I'm busy.
The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.
That sounds like the manager of the new Krusty Krab 2. Oops. Hold on. Congratulations, buddy.
Oh, I love being purple!
You don't mean...?
Good luck, SpongeBob. Hey, look for me at the ceremony. I got a little surprise for you. I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah.
Hooray for SpongeBob! Hooray for SpongeBob!
Let's hear it for SpongeBob! Hello? Where'd everybody go? Did I miss something? Did you see my butt?
Hey, it's the new Krusty Krab 2 manager!  Wow, the pressure's already setting in.
What? Why?
[] What?! That's insane!
Well, saying you're a kid, it's like saying  a kid!
I'm supposed to get a toy with this.  Thanks.
Are you sure?
Okay, see you.
Yum!
Now you're talking. Hey, waiter, we need another one over here.
Yeah.
He can do it in 9!
7!
Fi--ve.
She's pretty, SpongeBob.
You're hot.
What's my name?
Hi.
What is it?
Wow!
Hey, I thought you didn't have a driver's license.
Are they laughing at us?
Kids?!
Who's the kid now?
Going on.
Yup.
Oh, yeah. All right.
Are we there yet?
By car.
SpongeBob, look!  Our car!
Where do you think it is?
I know. Walk in and ask him for it.
Sorry.
Ooh! Ooh! Wait!, I wanna do the distraction!
Ahem! Can I have everybody's attention?  I have to use the bathroom.
I had to go to the bathroom.
Whoa.
SpongeBob, it's the Goofy Goober theme song.
I'm trying. Trying so hard.
Guess what I got.
Okay.  We're on a baby hunt. And don't think we don't know how to weed them out.
Good morning, SpongeBob.
I'm getting two today. One for me, and one for my friend.
You know me, SpongeBob.
Mashed or scalloped, sir?
Sir, yes, sir!  Locked and loading!
I think we have a few minutes before he gets here.  Huh?  He's right on top of us!
Whoo!
Finland.
Hold the mayo!
I can't hold the mayo any longer!
Uhh... I just remembered! I don't work for Mr. Krabs.
Hey! I ordered a double Krabby Patty.
Good morning, Squidward. I'll have the usual.  With cheese.
No Krabby Patties?  NOOOO!!
Come on, tummy. It's gonna be a long day.
I...need...Krabby Patties!
I...need...Krabby Patties!  Vandalizing stuff.
Hey, what's with all the questions? Who are you guys?
Oh, yeah. Well, if you're SpongeBob, then what's the secret password?
Correct! It  you! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob.
SpongeBob! Why aren't you at the Krusty Krab making Krabby Patties?
Yeah, Mr. Krabs says you and Plankton took it.
A team? Oh, oh, pick me, pick me, pick me!
Yeah, yeah, loyalty. I'VE GOT SPONGEBOB! HE'S OVER HERE!
BECAUSE I...NEED...KRABBY...PATTIES!! Hurry up! I'm hungry! Over here!  Guys? Am I still on the team?  Hey, what are you looking at?
What? Huh? Who goes there?
What? Huh?!
Nice try, but it's gonna take more than that to--
Uhh... Squidward?
Does anyone have a picture of ketchup?
Cheese!
I bring a message from the dawn of time!
Run!
My feet hurt.
Well, it's not fair. You have feet. Sandy has feet. Squidward has feet.
Well, maybe if you didn't have four feet!
What's happening? I feel tingly.
Maybe this guy knows where we are. He looks smart. He's got five heads.
Hey, my friend's talking to you!
Ahh...Where have you been all my life?
Oh, hey Squidward.
SpongeBob, you would not believe the size of the ice creams here. [Squidward strides up] I wonder what other giant snacks they have.  Cotton candy!
How does it end?
I wanna be on a new team. This one's broken.
Will it be a happy ending?
Huh?
Oh, yeah, sorry!
Yeah.
I can't see my forehead. What's your problem?
Me too.  Inflatable pants! What's your idea?
Forget my dumb idea, that's great!
Awww! I gotta draw a new battery for this.
SpongeBob, sometimes we have to go deep inside ourselves to solve our problems.
Then I'm going in for you!
Sorry. Stupid inflatable pants!
Huh?
Green.
Come again, sir!
Don't touch me, I'm sterile!
And they said I'd never make anything out of myself.
The dirty therapy seems to be working just fine.
I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob.
You're the most adult person I know.
You know how grandmas are, they love babies. You just can't act like a baby around her.
Have I ever not been right?  You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one.
Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest.  Now say "tax exemption."
Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz.  Okay, SpongeBob, you're ready!  This is it. What are you going to tell Grandma?
No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
And then you get behind her and I'll push.
Oh yeah, right.
Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff.
Keep 'em coming, Granny!
I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby!  Being grown up is boring. I love being a baby. Besides, I don't get jazz.
All right!  Rewards, huh?
Oh, Grandma, I'm full.
Oh boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!
D'oh! My wittle finger!
Sorta....  this finger hurts a little bit too.
Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies!  Alright, another hat.
EEEEEEEEE...
Om.....
Um...
Hey, you got the same reef blower as me!  Tag, you're it.
Sure did.
Like this...
Yeah!
I hate this channel.
Ying!
Can I get a large #1, extra size?
I love... fried oyster skins.
I guess we've got to order inside.
Are you Squidward now?
Are you Squidward?  That's OK, take your time.
Oh hello.
Who are you people?!
What about this towel from the Sizzling Spring Sauna?
And Sandy's hedge clippers?
But I don't work here!
I don't know. What do you want to do today?
I don't know. What do you want to do today?
I know what I want to do today!  I need some money.  Uh.  Oh.  Oh...   I don't have any money.  SpongeBob, I want a balloon really, really badly!  Really, really badly!
No, wait!  Instead of borrowing the money, why don't we just borrow the balloon?!
It's just borrowing, right?
Right!
This is so great!
Yeah, then we can go to the beach with the balloon!
And the moon and the sky and under a car, behind the dumpster!
And then my backyard!
And over a rock!
And with a whale!
How are we going to return it now, SpongeBob?
I got the air!
Ga-heh!
Wha-guh!
Hi-yo-hoo!
Confess?!  Are you out of your mind?! Do you have any idea what they do to people like us? We're not talking about some dumb mail fraud scheme or a hijacking here.   We stole a Balloon!   And they're going to lock us up forever.
He's onto us!
I'm on it, SpongeBob!
Goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
Yup.
I wanna go home.
Hey, if we're underwater, how could there be a...
I'm scared, SpongeBob!
Hey.
Oh!
I want ice cream!
Yeah!
And the bitter cold, it's bracing, isn't it?!
Yeah!  And we can fly!
I'm way ahead of you, buddy!
Uh, let me try:  Uh...hey, punk.
And we owe it all to  you.
Oh, I'm nothing but a lot of talk! You're the one with the sticky fingers.
You, too!  I wish we had something to eat, though.
Rectangles!
Oh!
Thanks SpongeBob. I think I'll eat it now!  I think I'll eat it now.  Ow! Who?  Where'd my candy bar go?  I must have dropped it.
Where'd it go? I'm gonna starve.  Where'd it go?
I can't find it!  Where could it possibly be?  Ahaha!
You stole my candy bar!
Oh, so that's how it is, huh? Once a thief, always a thief.
You took my only food,  now I'm gonna starve.
Yours? You mean mine.
I don't want it unless you admit you took it.
Liar, liar, plants for hire.
Well, you would know... liar.
You better not!   I'm warning you!
Don't!
Stop it!
Don't!  Oh!
Ah!  [As SpongeBob puts the bar through his head and moves them left to right.] Ah!  You're a crazy person! I should have expected this after the way you stole that balloon!
Oh,  that's it!
First the balloon, now my candy bar... you're out of control! I'm...  ...I'm telling on you.
I'll beat you there!
No, you are!
I'm not good.
You said it!
All right! Which one of you flatfoots stole my lollipop?  I mean it.
Just like a genie. (laughs)
Like a genie. (Laughs)
Yeah.
Ooh, ooh, me, me!
There's no words on this paper.
Yippee! A writing stick.
SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one?
Uhh, SpongeBob...  Thanks.  Dear Sant...  D'oh! Not again.
Santa! Haha. Where's Santa?
Here you go, SpongeBob.
Another piece of paper.
A star on top will complete all the scenery!
He probably just stopped for a snack! Fat guys get hungry right?
Never trust a genie.
Wow.  A wrist watch.
Yay! Yay! Ha-ha! I'm gonna beat you there! I'm gonna... ah, it's gonna be fun! Ah-ha...
Look, she's on the Eating Channel.
We better put these on.
When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob? "No" means "yes"!
SpongeBob, look at this!
It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before.
What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see?
It's okay, SpongeBob. This stuff is water! Look!
Take it off. No one's looking.  SpongeBob, did you hear that?
That is one tired tree.
Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!
Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep.
Yeah! I'm getting away! Faster!
Faster, faster!
That's not disturbing.  is disturbing!  Hi there, SpongeBob. My name is Patback.
Uh, SpongeBob?
Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us!
Please, Sandy, I can't afford dry cleaning!
Fun's over.
Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint.
Hey Sandy, does it work?
Hey, Sandy! Don't wake up!
You'll never catch me!  Hey that's not fair! Cowboys couldn't afford cannons.
Nice paneling.
Who you calling Pinhead? I want to be Dirty Dan!
I'm dirty.
I say I'm Dirty Dan!
I'm Dirty Dan.
I'm Dirty Dan.
I'm Dirty Dan.
I'm Dirty Dan.
I'm Dirty Dan.
I'm Dirty Dan.  Screaming will get you no-
Uh? I am?
Hot wings?
Did you win?  Hi, SpongeBob!  Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan. I just wanna be Patrick!
Ouch!
Let me have a try.  Open sesame!  Well, I've done all I can do.
Barnacles.  Is it spring yet?
I'm so cold that I'm shivering!
I'm so cold that...I'm shivering!
Maybe she just ignores it.
Maybe?
It's like a gold mine, but with fur.
Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!
Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, BIG man!
This is taking too long! I want the warm NOW!
No, I'm warm.
Man, that fur really hits the spot! No more frozen armpits.
You said it!
Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Oh boy, would I!
I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it!  Tag, you're it! I win, I win!  What's with Gary? He sounds like a motor boat!
It tickles!
Brush brush brush, brush brush brush
Brush brush brush,  Brushin' everywhere  Nope.  Oh, hey, here he is!
Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight?
A sleep-over! Oh boy, oh boy! This is gonna be great, Gary. We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games
And then we'll make a house of cards, and then we'll read some comic books
Blah blah blah blah blah
Hey, SpongeBob!
Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows!  See?
Come on Gary, let's play a different game.
Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!
I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. So I suggest that you put him down and let him choose.
Well, well, well I guess that answers that question.  So long, SpongeBob. Me and Gary got stuff to do.
Hi SpongeBob.
Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?
And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?
Here it comes
How pathetic
I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself.  It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary?  He only liked me for my shorts!
Gary? I thought what we had was special...!
Patrick.
Maybe he doesn't like us.
Yello?
Oh great! Who are they?
Merry Christmas!
How about some soup on your best day ever?  Here we go!  Oh, it's a little hot.
Music isn't best either!
Firmly grasp it in your hand.  Firmly grasp it.  Firmly grasp it!  That oughta do it.
I think we gotta show him how it's done.
This guy's good.
Yeah, you got it Squidward! Yeah, you're doing it Squidward! See who'd you been missing?
You got what you wanted, Squidward! You can do that distance! Use that net!
Yeah! You're feeling it Squid! That's it, all the way! The last 6 miles, make that Squid! Go, go, go!
It's in the bag!
I had fun.
Here comes Squidward!
There's always tomorrow!
You know, from yesterday!
Yup, he's still mad.
Jellyfish are awesome!
Touch.
Touch.
Touch.
Ice cream?
What's so great about a nerdy pickle?
SpongeBob, as a friend, I must say that's really geeky.  Oh my gosh! Jeffrey Jellyfish! Wait, Jeffrey! I have to touch you!
Hi, SpongeBob! Did you get into that club?
Well, SpongeBob, I'm glad you learned your lesson.  Hero worship is unhealthy.  C'mon, Jeffrey.
...and BoyPatrick
I'll get the Aqua-Glove.
What about the invisible boat mobile?
Huh? MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA...
MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA!
Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?
FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO!
But you said you had a question.
Well, that's not a question.
Oh, I love that episode.
Doesn't look familiar to me.
Nope, it's not mine.
Return what to who?
Yup.
Yup.
That makes sense to me.
It's not my wallet.
Oops, sorry. Can I start over?
Oops. Gotta start again.
Oops!
My wallets.
No! SpongeBob, tickle him!
I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?
Wrong!
Let go of it, SpongeBob.
Let go!
Peanuts?
Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted.
Gesundheit.
What's that smell, SpongeBob?
Good, I thought it was my skin.
...and Barnacle Boy!
Ignition, on!
Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license.
Thank goodness for invisible seat belts.
Uhh...
Whoo-hoo!
Squirrel fur!
That's a good one, huh, Sandy?
SpongeBob, five minutes.  Hel-lo... Sandy. Me Patrick. Do you un-der-stand?  Squirrels.
Tell the one about the squirrel and the light bulbs.
Better at what?
She says land creatures are best.
I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite.  Ah.
Thank you, thank you.
Sandy's a girl?
Airhead...  Huh?
Our fitting!
Hey! We are not chicken!  Huh! My popcorn!
I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball!  Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!
Yeah! Yeah! Woohoo!
I may keep a second rock up here.
What are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation? Let's get over there!
This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring!
Well, I'm outta here. Thanks for nothin', SpongeBob.
Oh boy, did I miss it?
Now this is a show!
No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?
Man, if I see the guy who upset Clamu, I've got a few choice words for him, like "you"... and "are" ... and ... "a jerk!"
Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?
Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!
Gotcha!
Where were you on the day of today? Don't play games with me, mister!
Oh, hi, SpongeBob. I'm just continuing my investigation of the great Clamu Caper!
Yes! No wait, uh... no.  But this grain of sand looks pretty suspicious, and so does this rock!  And I've got a few questions for this little piece of grass! Don't worry, SpongeBob! Patrick's on the case! The truth will be revealed!
Hey, SpongeBob!
This is it! All of the clues are coming together. I followed these footprints right to this exact spot and then, right where you're standing, I found this bag of peanuts! Ha! Oh, I'm so close to solving this crime, I can almost taste it.  Boy, crime fighting sure makes me hungry, and this yellow popsicle hits the spot!
Wow, you guys are good. I'm the last person I would have suspected, but I was looking for me all the time! It's the perfect crime!
I get what I deserve!  Ouch.
Dum, dum, dum dum, de, dum...
I knew it!
Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!
How about...
Clean...
Squidward!
SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
I don't know. Why?
Yes!
Probably.
Uhh...
We'll do anything you say!
And I got this hat!
No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
I don't get it.
Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!
Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!  Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!
Moving behind the rocks!
How does he do that?
Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
Or an oversized coffee mug?!
Wait, I have an idea!
Let's leave!
Let's do it.
Yeah.
It would seem we have reached an impasse.
Make it five.
Three. Take it or leave it.
Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier!
Wait! I think it belongs to me!  Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...
Uhh...
Uhh...
Uhh...
Uhh...  Okay! I've got it.
Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum?
Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!
Aaaah! Let us out!
No!
Hi.
You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!
Two...
What is that thing SpongeBob?
Go touch it.
Whatcha drawin'?
Psh, artists.
Pretty good, SpongeBob! But it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired.
SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!
No, I mean it's swimming away!
Your art can never hang in a museum.
Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true.
Life is good!  Easy come, easy go!
My turn!
Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.
It's Squidward, silly!
You're right, SpongeBob.
Poor Squidward.
He's going to the door.
He's beating up Squidward!
He's got the pencil.
Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.
I'm not going in there
What just happened?
Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?
Where's the leak, ma'am?  Yurrgh!
Finland!
He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie!
Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob! Heh heh.
Oh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?
Happy birthday!
Here's your present.  You're welcome.
Take it easy, it's just a drawing.
Done and done.
Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?
It's the evil doodle!
So... he's a drawing?
He still looks kind of creepy.
Ready!
Oh, boy, am I!
First, I have to put away my secret box.
Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh!  Oh, SpongeBob if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life!
You do?
Like what?
Do I?
No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!
WOW! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh.  Tell me some more secrets!
Gasp. I never would have guessed.
No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.
Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret.  Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the secret of the box.  Nobody! Not even Squidward's house.  It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna  SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over!
For the last time, SpongeBob, no!
Never!  So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club!  Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants!  If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!
Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever?  The most amazing...  mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom.
Friends.
Seee... cret.
Duh... who's there?
EH?!  WHO'S THAT?!  Mmm... water.  Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside.  Nighty-night, boxie.
Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!
It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box!  Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life!
Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me.
Our friendship ring! IT IS YOU!  How could you do
That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is OVER!!!
Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to.
Well, didn't I tell ya?  Isn't it great?
A secret string!
Good night, SpongeBob!
Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the...  ...secret compartment of my secret box...  ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at the Christmas Party!  Merry Christmas, SpongeBob!
Is mayonnaise an instrument?
Kicking? I wanna do some kicking!
Whoever is the owner of the white sedan, you left your lights on.
You're welcome.
These are some ugly looking fish.
Oh boy! Three A.M.!
Come on, SpongeBob!
Who is that?  Hello?
Sleeping.
SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.
Well, I'm listening.
Polo!
NEED... FURNITURE!
Oooooooh, sweep sweep!
You know something, SpongeBob? It's just all fun and games for you. Nothing really matters.  "Oh, let's go jellyfishing! We don't have any work to do! Life is just a big bowl of fancy assorted cashews, and nobody has anything to dust or to clean or to wipe! Or fabricate!"
I don't know what to do, SpongeBob. You gotta to help me!
No, it's not that, SpongeBob; it's worse.
Look!
Yeah, but turn it over, there's a letter!
And, I got this message from my parents!
SpongeBob, my parents think I'm dumber than a sack of diapers.
That always cheers me up.  But not today.
But don't they watch television?
But don't geniuses live in a lamp? And besides, we don't know any dumb people.
Math is power!
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...  Oh! H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...!
W, X, Y and Z!  Hi Mom. Hi Dad.
Why wouldn't I recognize my own parents?
Well I know where it...
I'll go get the beverages.
Hooray, the idiot's here! I mean, I'll get it!
What a surprise!
Mom, Dad, meet my neighbor, SpongeBob!
He means "shake".  No, SpongeBob, no! Shake hands!  No, SpongeBob! Grab my dad's hand.  Grab it with only one hand!  Good boy! Now move your arm up and down!
No, SpongeBob. Show them your house!  No, not your blouse! Your house!
Hey, SpongeBob! You wanna stay for dinner?
Only on Wednesday.
Yeah. And it would take more than some masking tape to fix that guy.
Oh, that's nothing.  You should see him in the morning prancing around yelling "I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!"  He drives all the neighbors crazy!  Why, just the other day, our neighbor Squidward was--- . ---was really no help for him.  I mean, look at the way he's dressed. Only somebody with holes drilled in their head would wear that stuff! And how about his shape! I mean, I've heard of barrel-chested,  but never box-chested!  Hey, SpongeBob do you have any  I could borrow?
Aw, he said my name.
Ow! He bit me!
Oh, I guess the dummy wants to have a private conversation.  A dumb one!  So, what's on your mind? Oh, wait, I already know the answer. Nothing!  See, that's funny. 'Cause your dumb!
Oh, were those too complicated for you? I'll try dumb-ing them down a bit.
That's just what I'd expect you to say. Dumb people are always blissfully unaware of how dumb they really are.
Oh, SpongeBob, if only you could see how stupid you sound right now, with your talk of imaginary plans. Tell you what. You've caught me at a good mood. I'll humor you. Go on, go out there and act "smart" for everyone.
And don't worry, I'll keep this warm for ya!
It wasn't easy, dad.
That must be actual size.
Janet? Marty? Who are you people?!
Mom! Dad!
Hi, garbage man. Hi, SpongeBob.
"Krabs..." Uh, isn't that the red sweaty guy you work for?
Hmm... ! Oh, hey! I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers.
You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-o! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!
Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This  day is particularly  lovely!
Oh, mine too!
Pretty  good, SpongeBob.
Nice  day we're having, isn't it Squidward?
Yeah, it's fancy talk.
That's a lot of  bad words!
Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.
Oh, boy, my favorite!
Oh, eels. Too bad, SpongeBob, you gotta ride the eel.
My turn!  Hooray! Escalators! Yay!  Up, up, up!
My turn!  Escalators!
Es-skee-lators!!  Well, this is your last chance, SpongeBob, or if you get eels again, you lose!
Eels...
Ooooh...! You said number 11!
Don't worry SpongeBob, I understand.  Mr. Krabs! [runs out the door] Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!
But, you said ""!
Not if I tell first!
See ya at the Krusty Krab! Ha, ha, ha!  Oh no!
Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs, Mr. Krabs!
What's going to happen to us?
Oh, no!
I'm sorry too, SpongeBob.
Agreed!
Nine...
Hey, SpongeBob.
Are you trying to move the ground? You'll never move it like that. You gotta get under...  neath it!
Games? Can I play?
Be a fry cook? Is that all I gotta do? That'll be easy!
How hard can it be?
Oh, come on. You're just flippin' patties.
Tssss...
Well, at least I don't polish my fingernails.
Fingernails! Fingernails! Fingernails!
I cannot believe what I am hearing!
Holes! Holes!
Yellow!
I'm gonna get a job as a fry cook and it'll be easy!
Oh, yes I am, Mr. SpongeBob SuperiorPants.
Check it out!
I've been working for the Chum Bucket for almost five minutes.
Nuh uh. I'm eating my own dust!
Yellow!
He's not?
He wouldn't!
I'm mean!
Because you told me to!
Take that, yellow boy!
That's what you think, but it's not over yet.
Forget the Chum Bucket. This is personal.
Noooo! My name's... not... Rick!
I don't like you more!
I a thousand times never liked you!
Yellow!
Pink?
Yeah, pal. Let's go home.
You're my best friend ever.
You know, these were white when I bought 'em.
Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
Right, you're a turkey!
It's what you are!
Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
You are!
Wow, Squidward, you're choking!  Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well.  I win!
I did?
Friend?  Friend...
So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend?
Clarinet? I love music!
Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah!
Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob.  Oh!
Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya.
Oh, yeah?! Well, he was  friend first!
Squidward?!
Where are ya, ol buddy?
Me neither! This was a setup!
How about some for your best friend?
Can I have some now, buddy?
I still didn't get any!
Squidward!
Hey, Squidward!
Squidward!  Squidward!
Oh, yeah...
Hey, Squidward!
Squidward!
Hey, Squidward!
Hey, Squidward!
Squidward!
Hey, Squidward!
Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
How pathetic.
That's horrible!
We should take Bikini Bottom, and push it somewhere else!
What's wrong with my idea?
PUSH!
PUSH!  Push!
You said it, pal.
I could look at it all day.
What?
So, how's that tan coming?
Just a minute, Ah!  I could have sworn I was laying on my back.
Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys.  Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies!
I'm going to the snack bar.
Ice cream?  Did somebody say ice cream?  Where is it? Is it here?  Huh? Ice cream, yay!  Cramp!
Help, help!  I can't swim!
I'm drowning! I'm drowning!
I'm drowning cause I crossed the line!
Can't swim! Butt hurts! Ice cream!
Help, help!
Help, help!
Help, I'm drowning! I've got butt cramps! I want ice cream and now its dark!  Help, help! Help me, I'm drowning! Help!
Oh, sorry.
Goodbye, ice cream.
And I still don't have my ice cream.
Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?
What did he say?
Squidward, you and your nose will definitely not fit in!
That's what we've been trying to tell you!
We told you you wouldn't fit in.
Ready!
What happened?
Yeah. You could be bald and have a big nose.
It's not?
Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!
The shell knows all!
The shell has spoken!
Maybe he's not a brother.
Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Hmm... Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
All right!  Sorry, Squidward.
Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.
It's spring!
Hey, SpongeBob!
Hi, I'd like to place an order for delivery.
Yeah, hey Mario. Let me get a large double olive, double-
You're working at Pizza Castle now?
No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives.
Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats.  I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny?  It must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt.  Hello? Is this Pizza Castle?
I need my glasses.  Hmmm...  ...it's the mail truck!
Hey, SpongeBob, when do we stop hopping?
I thought it wouldn't work.
A starfish!
See, Squidward? It works! You try!
Let's play Mountain Climbing Adventure!
Check.
Check.
Uh... check!
You got it!
I'll take it easy when I'm dead! I'm shaking hands with Neptune! Whoo!
I am the lizard king! Whoo!
What?
What should we keep down?
Hold me.
SpongeBob! My legs are frozen solid! You're going to have to cut them off with a saw!
Why not?
Nooooo!
I could only hear the sound of our laughter.
Don't forget the second avalanche.
That's easy. All you need is a box.
That's good. Now all you need is a box.
Whoopee! Another box!
Here I am!
We have a tape recorder box.
Beep-beep-beep.
Beep-boop-bee-boop.
Beep-beep.
Yeah, see you in the morning.
Oh, well.
I hope he's not too down in the dumps today.
Ehh? Huh? Oh. Hi SpongeBob.
A Squidward action figure!  Let me play with him!
Fighter pilot!  Dive bomb!
And then comes a giant fist!
Oh...  and then comes a giant fist!
Oh, don't worry about it. He'll find love one day.
Well, sure. But it'll be with someone his own size.  Like this pickle! See? They like each other!
Let me take a look at it. Hmmm. You know what the problem is?
You got it set to  'M' for Mini when it should be set to  'W' for Wumbo.
Come on! You know... I wumbo, You wumbo, He she me...wumbo? Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, Wumborama... Wumbology, the study of wumbo? It's first grade, SpongeBob!
Well alright then. Let 'er rip!  It worked!
Look, SpongeBob's giant!  Can I be giant next?
You're kidding!  Good thing I still got this pickle!
You know what's funny? My pickle started out in a jar, and now it's in one again! Heh. It's like a pun or something. Heheh.
SpongeBob, this is star ranger, over.
I got a surprise for you.
Get out of bed.
Go to your closet for a surprise.
Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?
Patrick SquarePants!
What's the problem?
Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you.
Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?
Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing.  Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! Testing!  Testing!  Test. Do you read?!
Got your apple ready?  Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on.  Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural.
No, no, get in the boat!  Give her the apple.
Start the boat.
No, no, put it in drive.
Freeze, mister!  Big toe.
Okay, you're coming to your first turn.
Left.
Right.
Cheating!
What?
Well, it sounds like it's all your fault.
How are we gonna do that?
Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast!
Hi.
SpongeBob, I think she means it.
Snow angel!  Oh...  Hey!  Thanks a lot, SpongeBob! While you were just standing there whistling, someone threw a snowball at me!
Yeah.  This is serious, SpongeBob. Someone's after me. I think I better leave town.
Snowball fight? I want to play! I want to play!
Oh, yeah. A snowball.  Oh, this is gonna be great!  Huh?  Wha...?  Aw...! SpongeBob, could you help me make a snowball?
Thanks, buddy.
It's a snowball fight, remember?
That's me!
Huh?  Ha! You missed me!
I was trying to tell you that I was choking on snow, but the snow melted and turned into water, and I drank all the water, now I'm better.
Can I use your bathroom?
I don't think I can make it! Please?
Please?
Please?
PLEASE!
That's okay.
Yay! Squidward's on my side!
Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!
And who am I?
Hey, you can't talk to Mr. Krabs like that, Squidward!
You said  were SpongeBob, SpongeBob.
You got to have a fort, Squidward.
That fort's too small, Squidward.
Then it's war!
He got you good, SpongeBob!  Take cover!
Hey, SpongeBob?
I think Squidward's taking this really seriously.  That last one had his clarinet in it.
Nope.
What are you doing?
That looks like the toilet plunger I threw out yesterday.
Man, was I using mine wrong. How much?
I only got seven.
Patrick Star, you are one smart shopper.
You tell 'em, SpongeBob!
I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays.
Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?
Barnacles!
No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous.
Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon.
Yeah!
Who, me?
Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh...  ...kick boxer.
Tubby?  Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby!
Oh yeah.  No, please wait.  No, please have mercy!
I thought the Corps would help me straighten out my life, sir!
You mean like a weenie? Okay!  May I take your hat, sir? May I take your hat, sir? May I...
Give me that hat!  I said give it to me! Are you going to hand it over or not? Don't you back-sass me!
I see you got the paper.
Yep, see you later.
Well I didn't say anything.
Ah, but it is you  that is messing with me.  That's what's messing with us!
I'll take care of this!
What's the matter, is he stupid?
Well, we can't just leave him out here.
Let me see!  Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh!  I think somebody's hungry!
SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!
Let's try a donut.
A donut?
What now?
Do something, SpongeBob!
Wait! I think I might know the problem.  Yep, that's it alright.  Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new.
How do you think?  And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.
I know, good thing there's two of us.
Yeah! At least until it's old enough to be on its own! Oh, I wanna be the mom!
You're right. If I was a mom......this would be kind of shocking.  Just call me Daddy!
It sure is cute when it's asleep.
Hey, SpongeBob?
I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.
Well, good night, SpongeBob.
Alright! All this parenting stuff makes me hungry.  Hey Junior, how are you doing today?  SpongeBob?
Kid's got a stinky.
Ahh! Wish I could, but I gotta get going.
I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?
I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable.
Phew, what a day.
Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to but I'm totally beat from work.
That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!
Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise.
Phew, another tough day!
Work was a killer! I need my chair.
Tomorrow for sure.
I'll get to it eventually...
Uhhh.
Just one more minute, I gotta...
Hey, I'm missin' the coconut!
I changed his diaper!
He's only this big.  How many diapers could he possibly use?
Oh, that's not that much.
So?
I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh!  I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise!
No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal!
Six o'clock.
Six o'clock.
Six o'clock.
Six o'clock.
Oh, that was some party!  Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior. What? What?
Oh, what a relief.  For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.
Somethin' about root beer, right?
Oh wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.
I don't need this.
I'm going back to work.
He got hit in the head with two coconuts!
You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes I gotta move the antenna, sometimes I lose the remote,  and sometimes my butt itches real bad!
Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?
Yeah, overtime, pal!
You know what that means?
It means working when you're just too tired to work!
You just keep going on working and working!
There's that stupid noise again!
Oh.
No.
I guess he's all grown up!  Hey, what about Daddy?  That's my boy.
Goodbye, Junior.
This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.
Yeah... Let's have another!
A one-way ticket to pain!!
Yeah, SpongeBob?
No way, SpongeBob, we're not getting paid to move stuff.
Well that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final!
Good, just don't pay me.
Tarp ahoy!
That will never ever come off.
And mount them on the wall.  Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob!  CAREFUL, SPONGEBOB!!
Oh. Now it's my turn!
Well that was a rip-off.
Can you move it along, I'm all out of time cards.
Oh, I know!  Two giant paint bubbles!
Yeah, SpongeBob?
Nonsense!
Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!
I think you are over-reacting SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.
Oh, now I see it!
Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!
Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something!
Nope.
