Larry, my man, you are looking good enough to eat!  Could use a little teeth whitener, though. I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind.  Hey, check out his crazy comb!
Well, I think I've aired it up enough.  Hey, this party's finally starting to pick up.
Dude, look at your pecks! You're phenomenal! Truly a hard body. Look at those guns.
My altissimo dorsi has gone flabby! I gotta get to a rolling machine.
Hey guys! Yo, Patrick, cool shades.
SpongeBob, you never told me you had a girlfriend.
Bro, your girlfriend is not ugly.
It's cool, buddy. You don't have to explain your girlfriend to me.
I don't know why you're standing here talking to me when you could be talking to your girlfriend.
Congratulations on the new girlfriend, dude!
SpongeBob! Patrick!
I just got off the Fist O' Pain. Man, what a rush.  You smell that? That's the smell of adrenaline.
SpongeBob, I'm not smelling any adrenaline on you. You haven't gone on the ride?
Come on, Patrick. You and me, pal?
Maybe I should stop making people smell me.
Well, you've gotta take risks.  Live on the edge.
And you can't... Uh... You can't...  And you can't live like these two. Just look at 'em. Spineless,  weak,  afraid of their own shadows.  Pathetic!
I'll tell you how: by living each day as if it were their last!
By living like me, Larry.
By living, like Larry.
Living like Larry!
Well, would you look at that. Now there's two guys who know how to live!
I'm proud of them.  Wait a minute, with that angle of trajectory, they'll land right in...Rippers Reef! They'll be ripped to shreds!  Wait, don't do it! Stop!
Drat!
Whoooooa!!!  Look, guys, my advice wasn't meant to be taken literally! I meant to live life to the fullest, not to maim yourselves! Look!
AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!  AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!
What would Larry do? I'll show you what Larry would do!  Come here! Come here I said! Hey!
: Sure. Everybody does. It won't hurt me a bit.  Told you it wouldn't hurt.
: See ya' round.
: Hey, what's the big idea?
:  "Larry the Loser Gets Beaten Up by Pipsqueak?"  But, but, but...
: Not now, SpongeBob. Let me take in the fact that my life is ruined!
: These lies someone wrote about me.
: All the kids in town want to beat me up for lunch money!
SpongeBob, is that you?
Dude, you're ripped!
Are you kidding?
Do I know you?
I was just picking up some dietary supplements here at the supermarket. I've been working on my chest... and buns.
Well, catch you later.
No time now. Somewhere, there's sand that needs kicking.
Baby worms?
I'll take them off your hands.
Sure, why not? That's just what the nutritionist ordered: raw protein!
Dude, nice hustle.
Sandy? You don't look so good. Hey, you gotta stop eating at the Chum Bucket. That stuff will rot your insides.
Sandy, you don't sound like yourself.
Well, as long as there's no reason to be suspicious.
1,397, 1,398--  Whoa!
Can't right now, bro. I got about 4,098 more reps to do.
That's right, pal, but that's not all.
Now Push!
Harder!
Butter? Yipe!
Woah woah. Whoopsy!
Sorry about that dude.
Hand on up here!
Come on, bro! You can do it!
Or maybe not.
Sweet! Instant tannage!
Um... "I am having a weight lifting competition!?" This sounds too good to be true!
So, Squidward, what do you wanna talk about?
Oh, I've been there, amigo.
Sure. But nothing clears the sawdust out of your brains quicker than a ride on a jet ski.
Ever been on one of these little babies?
Well, you only live once. And I just happen to have an extra helmet.
I'll say!
Hey, you know that's very uncool. What kind of thoughtless ding-dong would knock another man's passion?
It's Larry.
Well, that's not my kind of thing at all, but for you sure. I'll just need to stop by the apartment and make myself a protein shake.
Oh, I wouldn't call it "glop". Protein shake saved my life, bro.
Hey SpongeBob, throw us the ball.
What you see before you is the culmination of my lifelong dream! A place of my own where I can work out everyday and anytime I want, Larry's Gym!
Looking out at this sea of plastic muscles and sagging flesh. Frankly, I'm disgusted.
Therefore, I'm now opening the gym to everyone in Bikini Bottom!
For the price of a lifetime membership!
But today everything is free!
Well, I don't know if I'll say that!
What's in that pink box?
Do-nut brings those in here! In the meantime, enjoy yourself because your first visit is free!
That's right, sir! For your first visit we-
Hello? In conclusion, I'm at your service to turn anyone anyone into a ripped heap of muscle glory!
Boy, I've got my work cut out for me.
The doors are automatic. Just step on the mat.
Here!
Uh, what are you doing?
No, no. Your first visit is free.
Time to go live the dream! Right after I,... file this paperwork.
I didn't think there'd be so much of it.
Even your cramps have cramps! You need to follow my number 1 rule.  Always be hydrating.
Sure!  What kind of a gym owner would I be if I couldn't take a puny, squishy lump like you?
What I'm saying is I can make you a man.
I'm gonna make you my personal project. Of course, you'll have to sign up for a lifetime membership.
That reminds me. You need to start hydrating right now!
And remember: always be hydrating!
That's what I like to see! Come on, we'll finish those later.
Oh, you guys. I'm just an ordinary Alpha Lobster doing his job. Towel boy!
Polish this crown for me. Will you?
Let me see. I may have something that'll work for you.
Here we go. Cotton swabs.  Cotton balls.  Here. Try this on for size, Hercules.
Pathetic.
Yeah, I've got another idea, SpongeBob. Come with me.
First thing tomorrow morning, this is gonna be where I leave my exercise class.
That's the spirit! And we're going to get you started early. Let me see some crunches!
The only thing I wanna see in your mouth is that water bottle!  Now what did I tell you? Always be hydrated! Now, I'll show you some crunches!  Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow! Yeow!
Could you do it without the laugh?
Whatever works I guess. Keep up with that and most importantly...
Ok. I have a lot of paperwork to catch up on.
Do you have to do that in front of me?
Potbelly?
Oh, I forgot all about my prodigy.
Oh my Neptune!
With all this paperwork, I haven't had any time to do my crunches. The only thing I've been crunching is numbers. But I'm gonna get back in shape. You'll see.
SpongeBob, tell me the truth.  Do I have a potbelly?
See you in exercise class. I guess.
Oh, what's the use.
Oh, who am I kidding!
Yeah.  Look, uh, you're obviously the alpha male at the gym now and I'm just a shell of my former self.
I need you to take over. You're a natural leader, SpongeBob.  You should be in charge of the fun stuff while I sit here in the reception area slowly getting fatter and paler until I die.
Come over here and give me a bro-hug!
I don't wanna call it that.
Dude, you were just overhydrated! Those weren't real muscles, they were water muscles!
Don't say brug.
SpongeBob, laughing on my back was just what I needed!  You're a pretty good instructor after all.  Oh boy. The way you laugh really gets on my nerves.
Huh?  What is that smell?  Mr. Krabs, how long have you been in there?!
Who, me?
Thanks, I work out.
Okay!
Nope, that was SpongeBob.
Oh, yeah, it's a turbo jet. 390 sea horse power with 11-to-1 pop-up piston.  We're talking some serious muscle!
Hmm...blow me something that screams Larry, SpongeBob.
Now, this is what I call a muscle car!
That's nothing! He called us fat!
SpongeBob, that bubble's got to go.
Jerky Pal...
Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.
You guys wanna go lift some weights?
Give it a try, Sandy.
How about a little more weight?  Observe.
Anybody up for some volleyball?
[impressed with SpongeBob's singing during the big concert] SpongeBob, that was so righteous. Would you... sign my pants?
Pretty Patties rule!
Practice begins tonight. 8:30 sharp.
Some guy in an ambulance.
Sure. Don't scratch the paint.
Gnarly, dudes!
Right over there. But you guys are way too old and unsightly for my beach. And I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Please do not land flying ice cream trucks on the bathers.  SpongeBob, you OK?  Hey! I didn't know you were a lifeguard.
The nose.
Sure, theres no hiding the lifeguard look, SpongeBob, and you've got it.
You bet I do. Say, we're a little shorthanded around here. How would you like to work the beach?
Alright.  Leave that on the bench, Kahuna. Hey, Annette, come here.  I want you to meet my buddy, SpongeBob.
Hey, guy's a lifeguard.
Yeah. Say, how'd you like to take the second shift?
Only if you think you're ready.
It's Larry. Well, I guess I'll just...
We've got a sinker! SpongeBob, let me take this. I haven't seen any action all day.
Breathe, darn you!
Don't mention it. It's all part of the job.  You know, SpongeBob, the babes and the big chair are great, but the best part is knowing you're the only thing that stands between these good people...  ...and a watery grave. And that's what its all about.  Their lives are in your hands now, cause I got a date with the tanning booth.  See ya.
SpongeBob?
You're not a lifeguard, are you?
Let's go, guys.  Very good. You fellas are learning fast.
Hey SpongeBob!
Yeah, what's the difference?
