Let's see...I wanna, no. I wanna, uh, no, uh, hmmm...
I've made my decision.
One Krabby Patty for me and a Pipsqueak Patty for the boy.
The Krabby Patty is too big for you. You'll never finish it.
Your Pipsqueak is getting cold. Shall I feed you?
EVIL!!!
Nighty-night!  Will you tuck me in?
Huh? I'm right here! Don't worry, good citizens! Nothing will stop me from defeating the E.V.I.L.!  Nothing!  Ice cream? I love ice cream! A double scoop of prune with bran sprinkles.  Mmm.
You're right.  I give up.
No, no, that's a terrible idea. But what if you help me?
Who wants to save the world?
Then it's settled! To the Mermalair!
These costumes belonged to the original International Justice League of Super Acquaintances!
Once you put on these costumes, their fantastic powers will become yours.
Sure! Power's all in the costume! Why else would we run around in colored undies?
So, it's settled then. We'll get one cheese pizza, one with pepperoni and mushrooms, and one with olives.
Those fiends! Attacking hormonally stressed-out children!
To Make-Out Reef,  away!
Leave those young lovers alone!
You fiends can't win! You're outnumbered!
And me makes ten, I think.
Super Acquaintances, attack!
I'll cool you off, Quickster, with one of my water balls!  Aha!
Okay, what do you want?
Good to have you back on the side of justice, Kyle. Let's go get you that Krabby Patty! "[leaves with Barnacle Boy]
How is that adult-sized Krabby Patty treating you, Barnacle  Man?
By the power of Neptune!
Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?
Wha? Evil! Evil!  Barnacle Boy! Don't forget there's evil!
Evil! Evil! E...
EVIL! EVIL, EVIL, EVIL, EVIL, EVIL!  Disgraaace!
To the meatloaf! To the broccoli! Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
To the table, away!
Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something.
Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride!
Up, up, and away. Up, up, and away.
Stop shoutin'! I'm nappin'!
What do you want?
Evil! Where is it?
Donuts!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite!  Throw a waterball at 'em!
He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
Sea creatures, attack!
I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
Who are you?
It's the Aquaphone!  What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello?  The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed.
Remind me of what?
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy...unite!  Kelp Thing, this is a posted, no-parking zone.
Evil can't park here between the hours of 6:00am and 12:00pm!
BONKO!
Get your hands off me, woman!
Now our dreams of being big screen heroes will never come true.
And the worst part is I can't remember why I started crying.
You will?
Vindication is ours! Vindi...how did I get up here?
We have to get back to those swollen Krabby Patties.
We have to get back to those stolen naggie daddies.
We have to get back to those stolen Krabby Patties! And if we don't stop that diabolical scoundrel-
To the boat mobile.
Listen to that engine purr.
Hey, little hero, this reminds me of the Episode 912. We were surrounded. The Kelp-Thing was to our right and there broccoli on the side. But if there was one thing I remember, it was how to forget.
The rain in Spain stays mainly on the...space! The final countdown. Stick to the...stick to the...Lou, my darling! Lou!  Now go out there and finish this movie, kid.
Stop! You can't do that forbidden.
Prepare to feel my wrath, you foul villain.  You may have won the Krabby Patties, but the battle rages on.  Mermaidmanacle Boy, unite!
Well, kid, you showed the world that even though our steps may have been slowed, we still have a little action left in these heroic old bones.
This is what passes for info-tainment these days?  Sweet mother of Neptune's mother! Look, Barnacle Boy! A call to action! To the Invisible Boat Mobile!
We don't have time for your childish games! We're responding to the distress signal that you sent!
Oh, fiddlesticks, SpongeBob. Do you know how hard it is in our... advanced age... to move? Don't shine a giant light in the sky unless theres a real emergency.  And another thing: What the-!?!  Dear Neptune! It's the most dangerous and foreboding of all our arch nemesesMy mortal enemy whom I have searched 57 years for! Come get some, fiend!  Come back here, rival!
Who?
No!
Why are we here again?
Who are those to hideous creatures of the dark?
We cannot escape, Barnacle Boy. He's too strong. Like the unbeatable taste of a Krusty Kids meal.
Who are you?
"Professor Plankton's Personal Products?"
I've got dandruff?
Oh, my!
I, Mermaid Man, think that Krabby Patties are, uh... uh, what?
I'm late for "Snappy Pabbies?" Barnacle Boy,   we're late for...
Wha?...
Ooh, a Krabby Patty!  Would you look at that?  Barnacle Boy, it's a Krabby Patty. Why, these things are...  ...evil!
I hate these nasty things, . And furthermore...
Your new favorite restaurant!
I'm back to my old self again! Thanks to you, SpongeBob.
Say, I could use a couple more of those, and an order of Krabby Fries.
Buy more cards!
Buy more cards!
More carrrrrrrrr........}
Zzbbb.....more cards...
Buy more cards! (x4)
You'll never escape this time, Man Ray! Our molecular bubble is impenetrable!
Whoa!
Stop!
Boy, I sure do like signing books. What's this for again?
And remember, stay on the path of evil!
Oh. Wh-what is evil?
Semi-retired!
Who?
I'll deal with these super villains with my trusty Mermerang!
Keep on your guard Barnacle Boy; they're getting ready for another attack!
Nice shot!
Now just hand me the Mermerang son.
The Mermaphone!  Mermaid Man here.  Mermaid Man here! Ah! Commissioner! What can I do for you?
You can count on Mermaid Man commissioner! It's for you.
What kind of quitter talk is that!? We're super heroes! We're going to that shuffle boarding competition, or my name isn't...  Owww! You're right Barnacle Boy, if only there was someone to take our place.
You can't argue with certification!
What will never work?
Good job boys! You won the tournament and returned the costumes.
Thanks again boys!
Good-bye young men! Oh look! We have more visitors!
Looking good Man Ray!
Yes boys, this is our locker of memories. It contains uh! Uh! I cant remember.
And as long as no one touches anything there's nothing here to be scared of.
Wow our bodies are so tight.
Where are you going boys?
They left us here. What are we going to do? Im sure itll all work out.
Order up.
I lost a desire and enough physique to fight long ago kid. Flipping patties is so much easier on the joints when youre my age.
You spaghetti for brans kids? We are the younger ones. The older ones  lost our souls and buried in this very restaurant.
Tartar Sauce? The topping that destroyed life as we knew it. If only my tartar sauce attack hadnt failed that day, we wouldnt be living in this wasteland. Were already out.
I knew I recognized you from somewhere and you ate that tartar sauce on that day. You realized what youve done.
Im not teaming up with you to do jack diddly squat! Besides, Man Ray had to buy the necks! O-E! Evil.
Barnacle... No! It means he put the electrical collar on me that wont allow me to leave the restaurant.
Haven't you two idiots have done enough damage already?
Keep away from me!
I suppose youve proven your medal but, Ill have my eye on you two. Now lets pop that Dirty Bubble.
Well in that case let the light house of justice shine on Ray Man.
Impostors.
If I want my tartar sauce I have to go through me first.
Bring it.  Take this.  Ill never let you win.
Looks like he's got a one-way ticket to Bikini Bottom, and there's only one thing he could be up to in Bikini Bottom, Barnacle Boy!
It's worse than i could have imagined! A team up!
April third, 12 of noon! That's tomorrow!
Not so fast, little flipper! We are far too out-manned! But fear not. We are always one step ahead of evil!
To the ocean's greatest heroes!
Yeah, I can hold.
That's funny. I thought it was aside for the I.J.L.S.A.
That's right!  Now, before you have to say goodbye, say hello to some friends!  The Elastic Wasteband!
The illusive Miss Appear!  And The Pi-Right Ponderer with his hairnet of knowledge!
Together, we are The International Justice League Of Super Acquaintances!
Careful Barnacle Boy! He's got Nuclear Touch!
Fracturing furniture! Hang tight buddy!
Hang in there, my daring deputy.
Swirling Shrimp! That fiend has taken control over Barnacle Boy!
I'm glad you asked!  I believe that if The Atomic Flounder were to touch that wretched growth, it would cause a chain reaction, reversing the polarity, and the molecular level, restoring Barnacle Boy to his natural state!!
That's what you think, curd!  Shield!  Ha, Ha, Ha!
The Sinister Slug's slime has got you stationary and stiff! Which means, your time is up, Hand!
I'll tell you about it later, now let's take out the trash!
Thank You Ponderer.
You really thought you were going to get away from it, did you? First up, villains, what does BGATFBC?
Book Club? You mean you weren't going to destroy a library or something?
That's right. Remember kids, no one can imprison you for reading!
You wanna go back to the start of it all, eh? Well, you see, in the beginning, it was all dark. And then all of a sudden, an event called The Big Splash formed the seas, and-
Oh... right.  Well, it all started when I was just a young, handsome muscular lad,  when suddenly, I noticed that my washing machine had stopped.
Huh?
...The story. Yes. I was a young, handsome muscular lad, soaking up the sun's rays on the beach,  when suddenly I became drowsy.  A wave came ashore, and drew me back into the ocean!  Suddenly, I realized I was being sucked under by a violent whirlpool! I was running out of oxygen fast.  But before I drowned, I was rescued by mermaids.  They took me to the ocean floor, where they gave me a magic sea star that allowed me to breathe underwater.
Huh?
Oh, sorry boys... There I was in the ocean, the only human who could breathe underwater.  Alas, such a life got lonely real fast; I had no other humans to talk to. What was a man to do? Then my question was answered.
I used my new telekinetic powers to draw barnacles into Barnacle Boy's body, where they took the place of his lungs so he could breathe underwater, too. It was at that moment when we decided to team up.
Oh... yeah.
That didn't happen!
Oh no, it didn't!
It didn't happen!
...No, not really.
Remember: It's up to you  to reveal the true face of crime. Sign up to be part of the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Junior Crime Fighters.
To the chiropractor...... Away!
The Conch Signal! To the Invisible Boatmobile!
Yes, Barnacle Boy?
Uhh, No.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
...found it!  C'mon, get a move on, son. We don't have all day.
Throttle...on.
[Tires screeching, Cat meowing] Activate torpedo mode. Fire!  Mermaid Man...
Oh, my Neptune, he's been horribly disfigured. Oh, blast us! We're too late.
Oh, yeah. Good to see you, lad. Say, Barnacle Boy, we gotta find out where that Conch Signal came from.
Alright. Where's the danger, son? Bring it on. Bring it on!
They don't tell us anything anymore.
That's right. The Conch Signal is an awesome responsibility. We're duty-bound to help whenever it sounds.
Good boy. [SpongeBob & Mermaid Man both click fingers at each other]
Oh, goody.
Ohh, youth. Cut down in his prime.  Oh, speak to me son.
Barnacle Boy, think about it. Emergencies don't come around as often as they used to.
Danger!
Must...must answer clarion call.
Barnacle Boy, don't squash his enthusiasm. After all, he could be the hero of tomorrow, or the villain. Besides, I remember another young whipper-snapper, who wanted to be a super-hero.
Maybe the Conch Signal is too much responsibility. But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?
To the Invisible Boatmobile!
When you patrol in the city, you'll always have to be vigilante. On your toes. Constantly alert. Always expect the unexpected.
Oh, that fellow over there used to be the Atomic Flounder. I know that he doesn't look like much, but he could go back to crime...  ...just like that.
Stop, kid. Stop! Let him go.
You know, for a pain in the neck, he's a pretty nice kid.
I'm right behind you.
Keep looking. Diligence. Diligence.
What's the matter?
Boatmobile, where are you?  Barnacle Boy, I found it.
In all his dirty roundness!
Aha! You saved us, son.
Are you up for another ride in the Invisible Boatmobile?
Up, up, up, and away! Up, up, up, and away!
You better give that back, Man Ray!
Or I'll take it back.  Now prepare for a help heaping helping of quick frying Tartar Sauce.
Huh, empty?
Who was that?
WHAT?!?! We don't have that kind of money.
[at the Krusty Krab] Two large Krabby Patties, comin' right up, sir.
Man Ray suddenly doesn't seem very evil.
Evil!
Hold on there, boys! You cannot play with this stuff.
No, no! Prolonged exposure from the Orb of Confusion will give you... uh... confusion!
Up, up, and away.
Through the double doors!  Away!
N-nonsense, Barnacle Boy, we've got to keep up our strength for the fight against evil!
To the register!  Away!
A double Krabby Patty and Coral Bits for me, and a silly meal for the lad.
You got it, bucky.  Will this cover it?
If you wanna grow up strong like me...  you gotta leave room for seconds. Here comes our waiter!
Quick lad,  to the invisible boat mobile!  Away!
Uhh...
Wait! We'll find it with the invisible boat alarm!  There she is!
Hello? Hello?
Your mother's right, son. Mermaid Man will understand.
Oh yeah.
[comforting SpongeBob] Awww, don't worry son. I understand!  Why, I remember back when I first used the belt, the year was nineteen aught eleventeen twelve, why I believe the president.
Oh, yes. The unshrink ray. Let's see, uh, uh-- Did you set it to Wumbo?
We've been shrinking for years!
