What?
Uh, sorry, girl, I can't. I'm working at Scorched Coral all day. It's heinous.
See ya later, Pearl.
Um, it's a wrist band.
Awesome.
Welcome to Scorched Coral. Please go away.
Oh, hey, Pearl. What are you doing here?
Yeah, sorry. You're a little late. We were hiring, but we actually just hired someone today.
Did you find a job?
Ew, that store is for old people.
Um, isn't it your nap time, Pearl?
Scarves.
No, I hate the past.
