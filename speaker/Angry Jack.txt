You come on down to Angry Jack's Shell Emporium!
I'm so angry about my massive inventory that I'm slashing prices like crazy!
$99.99 to buy this refurbished shell, and I'm angry about it! Or what about this one, brand new plastic shell, super-gloss coat, only $39.99!  HEY! GET THOSE NUMBERS OUTTA MY FACE!
Did I mention I'm angry!?
Once gone, gone for good, so I'm gonna sell sell sell, all these shell shell shells! So come on down to Angry Jack's now!
And remember, I'll match, or beat, anyone advertised rage or is absolutely... hey.  What are you doing in my commercial?
Nah, I just do that to make my commercials louder. And louder, is the same as BETTER! Now let's see if I can't get you into a new shell. Hmmm.  There she is. . There ya go, little guy.
Hey, accidents'll happen. Why don't we try this one?
Why don't you just hold your snail? I'll take care of the shells.
So, how do ya like this one?
It's our most reflective model.
I do have one more available. It's the only certified indestructible shell I've ever seen, but I'm sure you'll find a way.
The back? There is no back anymore.
REDUCED? YOU DESTOYED EVERYTHING! AND NOW, YOUR GONNA HAVE TO PAY!
I'M REALLY ANGRY!
AND I DEMAND IMMEDIATE PAYMENT!
This? This isn't enough to repay my fortune! I'm gonna need more!
No it's not! You've got two arms and two legs, don'tcha?
Give me one of each!
I'll also need some internal organs.  And an eyeball!  And your clothes.
