There will be three signs that signal the approach of the Hash Slinging Slasher! First, the lights will flicker on, and off! On, and off! Next...
Huh? Oh yeah, here you go. Next, the phone will ring, and there will be nobody there...
And finally, the Hash Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over! And then, he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways! Because, he's already  dead! Then, he taps on the window...
...with his greasy spatula hand!
Then he opens the door!  He slowly approaches the counter. And you know what he does next?
You REALLY want to know?
Are you SURE you want to know?
He... gets ya!
Uh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, I-I
SpongeBob, I was just-I was just!  I was just joking!
It's not true. None of it's true.
Of course. Nobody has a SPATULA for a hand.
It was all JUST A JOKE.
And, it's ended.
