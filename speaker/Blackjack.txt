Come on, little man. Let's go a couple of rounds, if you think you're tough.
Because it'll show what a little man you are.
That's right, little man.
Did you come here to quiver like a jellyfish, or did you come to wrestle?
I always knew you were a little man. Prepare to live your past in the present.
In the living flesh.
Just like the old days, eh, cousin?
