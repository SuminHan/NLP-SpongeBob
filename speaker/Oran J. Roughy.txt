I can take your luggage for you, sir.  Please follow me.
I am not a butler.
Your sleeping quarters.  I trust everything is to your liking.
Ahem. Perhaps Monsieur did not hear me. I trust everything is to your liking.
An honest mistake, monsieur.
I certainly did not.
For the last time, I am not a butler. I don't even have the butler accent.
I do not have a cabin. I sleep on the luggage.
