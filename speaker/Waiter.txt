Here's your Goober Meal, sir.
And here's your Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, sir.
There you go.
Why do I always get the nuts?
Hey. Hey, get up. Hey, come on, buddy. I wanna go home. Come on, pal.
Listen to me. It's 8 in the morning. Go scrape up your friend and get going.
Sir? Your fancy pantsy limousine is here.
Your bill, sir.
Oh, my mistake, sir. Thank you for pointing that out.  This is your bill.
