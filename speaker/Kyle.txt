Just keep weading. Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir.
Wait a minute. That's a terrible ending!
Andy, cue the music.
So, you mean the ending might be even happier?
Bye-bye, Mr. Poop. Now I can get my golden sticker.  Oh, hey, Mr. Piwate. I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
I can't fly without my feathers.
Just dwive.
My tiny little eardrums!
Pwease, Mr. Piwate?
