Why, hello, Mr. Tentacles! I'm Frederick T. Nitpick, world famous art critic! This is your artwork, I presume?
My considered opinion is "Eww!" I'm going to have to confiscate your artist beret.
Sorry, but I'm looking for a real artist!
An artist, eh?
Now, which one of you two is the artiste?
I'm a critic. I don't make things. I judge things. For instance, I judge your work.  Lame.
Oh, my guacamole frijoles! It's so, so, primitive and naive! You're a genius!
I'll give you 500 bucks for it! And this hat!
You are a master artist, my friend
Who's the critic here?
Brilliant!  I've never seen such an example of raw creativity! This piece will turn the art world on its head! I hereby declare this the next big thing!
