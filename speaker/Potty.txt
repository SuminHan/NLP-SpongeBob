Bawk, come on in!
Riffraff? That's our television audience, barnacle breath!
Bawk! How tacky.
The band I hired for the party.
No.
No.
No.
No.
They broke up years ago.
The Bird Brains!
The Bird Brains. They're better than all those other bands.
Bawk! Ready!
Bawk! It's time for your flute solo.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Bawk! The Bird Brains!
Bawk, the ladies are here!
Goodbye folks!
Sorry I'm late.
You're wasting your time, old man. Prehistoric stuff is lame. Everybody knows the future's where it's at.
No he doesn't.
Nope.
No he doesn't.
No.
not.
Doesn't.
Doesn't.
Doesn't.
Doesn't.
Laser technology. Score one for the future.
That's nothing, old timer. Make way for the future.
Never you mind, pops. Let's go see what Cavey thinks.
This is great.
Why the long face?
Come back inside. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Nope, even better.
Pretty sweet, eh?
Word!
Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I got you a present from the prehistoric times.
No.
No.
This is great.
Patchy! Patchy! The kids are here.
They're here to see the lost episode. Brawk!
What about your leg?
And your eye.
And your hand.
What is it? Brawk!
It's a dream come true!
Brawk!
You stink!
Brawk!
Brawk!
Brawk! Pipe down!
What a rip!
Sheesh, what a hothead!
Brawk! Patchy, come back! There's more!
I took the job for the free sodas.
P.U.! What are you cooking?
Where'd you dig that one up?
I'm already "board" with that one.
Aw, that's the worst one yet.
Brawk, Patchy, no!  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Brawk! Brawk!
Less talking and more working.
I came to tell you to get back to work!
Oh a thing called the G.E.D., man.
You just need some practice, that's all.
Smells like an unswabbed poop deck!
Brawk, roll film.  A perfect patty on the first try.
You're unsanitary, Patchy, You keep raw hamburger meat in an old boot!
You've got rats in the kitchen!
And you should wash your hands after using the bathroom.
That's not all! This is a step in the right direction.
The same kind who wears a "Kiss the Cook" apron.
Now I feel sick.
Brawk, you missed! Squawk! Is that all you got?
Now you've done it.
Hey, you didn't take time off, you got fired!
I got a golden parachute.
Brawk, looks like they already did.
Hey, Patchy, the new SpongeBob cartoon is about to start. Where are you, brawk?
Oh, I threw out that old Betamax machine in the garbage.
Oh, calm down, beardy.
Burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
Brawk. You're looking at the wrong camera.
Que camera three.
Que Talent.
Squawk, squawk, squawk.
Can I get you anything?
Just five more minutes.
Do you even know how to get to the North Pole?
No, Patchy, the directions to the North Pole are in the song, "There Goes Santa Claus."  There goes Santa Claus. There goes SantaClaus. Left on Santa Claus Drive, scurvy brain.
Look out! There's a fork in the road!
Squawk! What are you doing?
It's OK, Patchy, I can't stay mad at you.
I'm not going in there.
I sure would, Santa!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Potty want cookie dough!  Cookie!
Cookie!
Cookie!
Give us a lick!
Clarify please.
Man overboard?
Here you go!
They didn't?
Squ-ouch!
Give us a kiss!
Kissy, kissy!
Bawk! In what way?
Help! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!
Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk!
Sqwuak! I quit! I quit!
