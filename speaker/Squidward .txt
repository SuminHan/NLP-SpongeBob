Just clock out already!
The guy who won't even spring for a doormat!
Well, if I did run a restaurant, my exquisite taste and gourmet know-how would have customers waiting in line for years just to get a table!
Laugh it up! My knowledge and intelligence could make even the Chum Bucket a success!
Ouch, I think I picked up a tick!  Plankton?! What do you want?
Oh, I don't know about that.
I'll do it.
GeezSpongeBob, I hadn't thought of that! You're right! I quit.  Eh, a bit industrial, but I can make it work.  You call this a kitchen? We should start by tearing out this wall so the chef is visible to his adoring fans!
I don't see any use for all these old flap traps. We should just break them down for parts.
Oh, I'm sorry! Remind me, who's in complete creative control here?
So I guess the proof is in the pudding, then, isn't it?
I'm making chum fricassee.
See, Plankton, there's a trick to making chum edible. We just have to follow old Grandma Tentacles's secret fricassee recipe.
Nice try, tiny Cyclops. You won't get Grandma's delicate mix of seasonings and spices that easily, but preparation cannot be rushed. Each batch must simmer for exactly 24 hours.
Oh, just taste it already!
A star.
Give that back, please! Thank you!
Ah. You may speak.
What are you blockheads up to? Don't you know it's after midnight? Get down here!
Hat.
Oh, "The Fisherman." "The Fisherman." Blah, blah, blah. They wanta Fisherman, eh? I'll give thema Fisherman! And how!  No.  No.  Um... no.  Aha!  It's time for those lame-brains to meet the  Fisherman.  This is gonna be good.
Gotcha!
I'm the Deadly Fisherman!
Huh?
SpongeBob, how about more Krabby Pattiesand less heavy breathing?
Oh believe me, it's worth it.
