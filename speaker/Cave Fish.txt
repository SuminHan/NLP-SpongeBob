Safe? You're never safe out here in the wild! If I were you, I'd keep an eye on that big fella.
He's a big boy! Wait until when he gets hungry! It's eat or be eaten!
You've got to protect yourself! What you need is a fort!

Congratulations! You did it!
Earned your survivalist medals, of course! Only a hardcore survivalist would break down and nearly eat his best pal!
Cause I'm not just some old hermit.
