Don Snapper:	 Hello, I'm Don Snapper. And welcome to Fish Food Rescue, the show where I snap on disgusting food establishments. Today, we're going somewhere we've never gone before. The Krusty Krab. Let's see how krusty this place is.
Narrator:	 The Krusty Krab has been shelling out quality service with its signature Krabby Patty is the sizzling source of revenue. Mr. Krabs has served over 50 billion aquatic customers.
Don Snapper:	 Wow! This place seems spotless from bow to stern! How about the krustomer's satisfaction?
Customers:	 The only people who don't like a Krabby Patty, have never tasted one!
Don Snapper:	 Satisfaction duly noted. But how about the busyness of the business?
SpongeBob:	  At first, we didn't know what to do with all the money.
SpongeBob:	 But in the end, we decided to just give it all away.
Patrick:	 Come again, sir!
Don Snapper:	 Holy fishpaste! You keep selling those and you'll never go out of business!
Plankton:	 Yippee.
Don Snapper:	 But how about your competition?
Plankton:	 Where you can enjoy a nice helping of chum.  Oh, boy this is so...  ...good.
Don Snapper:	 Barnacles! This place is serving plank-tons of filth!
Plankton:	 What? It's just an ordinary Krabbyâ€”  Oh, my goodness!
Don Snapper:	 I don't embrace excuses. We need to shut it down!
Plankton:	 
Don Snapper:	 Shut it down! I'm Don Snapper. Tune in next time when we try and save the Chum Bucket. Trust me. I'm a professional expert.
