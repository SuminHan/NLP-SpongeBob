Squidward:	 Barnacles!
Patrick:	 How do like that, baby?
SpongeBob:	  Oh yeah. Well, how about this, baby? 
Squidward:	 Question. Are you two acting more infantile than normal?
SpongeBob:	 Aw huh. I found a box of my old baby toys in the attic, and we're playing with them.  Hey! I found my old teddy walrus! This really brings me back. 
Patrick:	  Yeah. it makes me feel baby-ish. Oh, Look at me I'm a baby. 
SpongeBob:	  Babies don't talk like that Patrick. They talk like... 
Squidward:	 Just as the essential oils were kicking in.  Hey! I'd appreciate some peace and quiet.  How dare you scoot away from me. I'm scolding here.  Would you two for once act your age!  Fine! Act like infanture hold-ups. See if I care. I'm returning to my grown up lifestyle. So keep it down! 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Squidward! 
Patrick:	 He's mumbling and drooling like a little baby
SpongeBob:	 Well, I don't know, Patrick. He isn't looking so good. We should take him to a doctor. Come on let's take him to the hospital.
Patrick:	 Hang in there buddy. we'll fix you up in no time. 
Purple Doctorfish:	 Hmmm?
SpongeBob:	 What's the prognosis doctor?
Purple Doctorfish:	 Your friend has a condition known by the medical term Head-go-boom-boom-itis. Not to worry though he recover over normally over time, but he mustn't receive any more blows to the head or he may stay this way permanently. Just care for his as he was you own bouncy baby boy and he will be fine in no time.

Patrick:	 Don't worry. I got this. 
SpongeBob:	 Hooray. Huh. Squidward!  Squidie are you ok?  We need to do a better job of protecting him.

Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, Squidward, enough duff-dragging! Get to your stations, pronto!
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, Squidward is in no condition to perform his Krusty duties.  The poor guy has the mind of an infant.
Mr. Krabs:	 I don't care if he has seaweed-for-brains. He needs to be behind that register. We've got customers out there just begging to hand me their money.
