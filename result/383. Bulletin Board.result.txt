Mr. Krabs:	 And how was your meal today, ma'am?
Sweet Old Lady:	 Oh, delicious. I wish I could tell everyone how great my meal was.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, you're more than welcome to go to each table and tell them about your satisfactory experience.
Sweet Old Lady:	 I don't really have time to do that. Perhaps I will mention it in my will.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, that's the way you want it.
SpongeBob:	 Wait! I have an idea!
Mr. Krabs:	 Hold on a second! That's me cork board! It's for all me... memos.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, think of it now as a bulletin board for the community. A place where a yearning populous can express themselves freely.
Ivy (gray):	 "My Krusty Krab meal was delicious! I cannot recommend it enough!" Huh. Well, I was just gonna loiter, but now I think I'll get a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, everybody! Our community bulletin board is here! Tell your friends and come on down and use it for the good of me business! Me wallet! Me... I mean the community.
SpongeBob:	  Community!
Pearl:	 Oh, I really hope people like it! 
Voice #1:	 Great!
Voice #2:	 Super good!
Voice #3:	 Number 1 with a star!
SpongeBob:	 See, Mr. Krabs? The community bulletin board is a good thing.
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes. Yes it is. It's bringing me closer to my favorite part of the community. Their money!
SpongeBob:	 Let's see what other nice people are saying.
Dave:	 What are you shrieking about?
SpongeBob:	 Nothing! I just love to shriek!
Mr. Krabs:	 Step aside, boy! You're blocking me money-makin' bulletin board!
Dave:	 "When I eat at the Krusty Krab, all I get is a dark, empty feeling inside!" P-Star7. Ouch!
Mr. Krabs:	  Not on my bulletin board!
Surfer Fish:	 Whoa, whoa, dude! What's with the censorship? The community bulletin board is for everybody. You can't just take somethin' down because you think it's bogus.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, Surfer Fish is right. The board is sacred and it must be respected.
SpongeBob:	 Dear P-Star7, I'm so sorry you had a less than stellar experience at the Krusty Krab and we promise to do better in future. Signed, Fry-Banshee139. Crisis averted.
SpongeBob:	 Huh? "Crisis averted? More like crisis dumb-blurted." Signed, Guybesideu3?
SpongeBob:	 Huh?  "Dumb-blurted! LOL!"?, "What's the Point"?, "I could make a better patty out of mud"?! Where are all these notes coming from?
Mr. Krabs:	 Pencils, paper! Pencils, paper!
Martin:	 I want to express the worst side of myself!
Mr. Krabs:	 Heh, heh, heh. Why not? And don't forget to feed your hatred with a selection from our menu!
Squidward:	 Huh?  Hmm.
SpongeBob:	 If only I could figure out who this P-Star7 is.
Patrick:	  Hello!
Nat Peterson:	 P-Star7 is my new hero.
Patrick:	 Hey, that's me!
Harold:	 Yeah, right.
Fred:	 He really knows how to complain.
Patrick:	 But I wasn't com...
Unnamed customer:	 P-Star7 is cool because he's anonymous.
Patrick:	  Oh, yeah. He's cool because He's a nanny-mouse.
Bubble Bass:	 You may not like what P-Star7 has to say, but you have to agree that he keeps it "real". He's a true hero for our troubled times.
SpongeBob:	  Well, I'll just have to make my Krabby Patties better so P-Star7 will like 'em.
SpongeBob:	 No, it's not round enough. Uh, maybe just a little off the edge here.
SpongeBob:	 No, now the other side is wobbly. I'll just even it up a little here.
SpongeBob:	 Now it's smaller than that one!
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Squidward!
Squidward:	 Yes?
SpongeBob:	 Has P-Star7 responded to my nice note yet?
Squidward:	 Oh, he responded hours ago.
SpongeBob:	 Well, why didn't you tell me?
Squidward:	 Because I don't care.
SpongeBob:	 That's for me! "Fry-Banshee139, more like Cry-Baby139!" Cordially, P-Star7.
Bubble Bass:	 His vituperative hyperbole has certainly diminished your credibility.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, why did you have to say that?
Bubble Bass:	 You're right. I should have put it on the bulletin board instead.  Signed, HandsomeLad42.
SpongeBob:	 You may be handsome, HandsomeLad42, but you're very mean!
Mr. Krabs:	  Alright, that's a good one. Heh, heh. Hey, you know all this note-writing must be making you folks hungry. We have a short line at the register.
Sheldon:	 I brought a bag lunch.
Mr. Krabs:	 What? Wait a second. None of you bulletin board browsers are buying me patties!
Medley Fishbowl:	 Why would we buy food from a place that quote  "Smells like stinky armpits"?
Mr. Krabs:	 What?
Mr. Krabs:	 That's not true!
Medley Fishbowl:	 Hey, it's on the board.
Bubble Bass:	 And the board is never wrong.
Mr. Krabs:	 And does anyone need to buy a pen?
Mr. Krabs:	 How about some paper?
Patrick:	 What's wrong?
SpongeBob:	 It's this P-Star7. He's been saying terrible things about me and the Krusty Krab.
Patrick:	 Oh, I think they were all good things.
SpongeBob:	 Not good. He said that the Krusty Krab made him feel dark and empty inside.
Patrick:	 Well, he probably meant his stomach was dark and empty and he was hungry for more.
SpongeBob:	 No. A master of acid-wit like P-Star7 would never express himself so clumsily. He called me Cry-Baby139.
Patrick:	  You were Fry-Banshee?!
SpongeBob:	 Yeah.
Patrick:	 Well, maybe he just thought it was funny. And... and when he said that Krabby Patties taste like old baseball gloves...
SpongeBob:	 He said that?!
Patrick:	 Oh, not yet!
Mr. Krabs:	  Tastes like old baseball gloves, do they?
Squidward:	  I don't know who this P-Star7 is, but he's brilliant!
Mr. Krabs:	 He's a diabolical genius! That's what he is!
Patrick:	  No, I'm not.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, the grill's gone cold.
Mr. Krabs:	 Nobody's orderin', son. It's that cursed cork board! I'm gonna take it down! It's nothing but trouble!
SpongeBob:	 You can't Mr. Krabs! It's for the community! I'll still believe in the power of the bulletin board!
Sandals:	  "You smell!"
Gus:	  "One of your eyes is too big!"
Bubble Bass:	  "Close your mouth when you eat!"? 
Pearl:	 Oh!  "This picture looks like it was drawn by a Brine Shrimp!" Oh, Daddy! 
Squidward:	 Huh?  "Squidward Tentacles should never be allowed behind a cash register." P-Star7? Oh, that is it! Why can't any of these yocals understand I'm working here? Ironically!
Bubble Bass:	 Oh, sure you are. P-Star7 has your number alright.
Squidward:	 I'm gonna give you a number, of contusions!
SpongeBob:	 People, can't you see what's happened? This bulletin board has become a bullying board!
Mr. Krabs:	 Okay, that's it! Everybody out!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, P-Star7 is bringing out the worst in everybody. I'd like to send him a message.
Mr. Krabs:	 We'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!
SpongeBob:	 A lesson in polite manners.
Squidward:	 Or we could push him off a cliff.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, excellent option, Mr. Squidward.
SpongeBob:	 We have to find out who this P-Star7 is! Gentlemen, I propose a stakeout!
SpongeBob:	  Pineapple1 to Maddaddy. Come in, Maddaddy.
Mr. Krabs:	  This is Maddaddy. I read you, Pineapple1. Any movement?
SpongeBob:	  Negatory. Pineapple1 to Delicate Flower. Come in, Delicate Flower.
Squidward:	  I AM NOT ANSWERING TO DELICATE FLOWER!
Mr. Krabs:	 Shh. Maintain radio silence. Wait a minute. I see something.
SpongeBob:	 So that's what happens to the ketchup stains.
SpongeBob:	 Surprise, P-Star7!
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward:	 Patrick?!
Mr. Krabs:	  I'll tear ya to pieces!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, you're P-Star7?
Patrick:	 Well, that's what my last note was about, SpongeBob. I was upset that people take everything I say the wrong way.
SpongeBob:	 So, when you said that Krabby Patties reminded you of old baseball gloves, you really meant that they gave you the feeling of your carefree youth.
Patrick:	 Yeah, I think.
SpongeBob:	 You hear that, boardy? It wasn't you. It was never you. We were the monsters all along.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, I'm still angry and I need somethin' to calm me down! Ooh!  This knittin' circle oughta do the trick. And you all are joining me! Especially you, Delicate Flower.
Squidward:	  Oh, ratfish!
SpongeBob:	  Pineapple1 to Knitmama. Can I needle you for a little more yarn? 
Squidward:	 Oh, brother.  Please bring back P-Star7.
