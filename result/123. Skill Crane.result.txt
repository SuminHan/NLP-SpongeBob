Squidward:	 Mr. Krabs, some guy in a suit wants to come in before we open.
Mr. Krabs:	 What? Guy in a suit? No, it's a tax collector!  Hide us, SpongeBob!  Now we'll walk nonchalantly to the rear exit. 
Squidward:	 He's got a card.  R.A. Penny Pincher: Vending Supplies.
Mr. Krabs:	 What? My machine has arrived?! Oh, let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in. 
R.A. Penny Pincher:	 Bring it in, boys. 
Mr. Krabs:	 That's it, set her down easy.
R.A. Penny Pincher:	 Here are the keys, Mr. Krabs.  Happy vending!
Squidward:	 What is it?
Mr. Krabs:	 Only the greatest money maker since the Krabby Patty.  Gentlemen, meet .
SpongeBob:	 Ooh. Skill Crane.
Mr. Krabs:	 At a quarter a pop, this thing will pay for itself in no time. Which reminds me, step up boys. First one's free. 
SpongeBob:	 Thanks, Mr. Krabs. 
Squidward:	 No, thanks, I'll pass.

SpongeBob:	 Well, why don't I give it a try? 
Squidward:	 Haha, good luck. You'll…
Skill Crane:	 Winner!

Squidward:	 Well, thank you for saying so.
SpongeBob:	 Beary says he's getting lonely. Don't worry, Beary, I'll get you a friend. 
Squidward:	 Ha! If you think you're winning that thing again…
Skill Crane:	 Winner!
SpongeBob:	 There ya go, Beary. 
Squidward:	 Oh, I loosened that one up for you. You would've never won that without my skill.
SpongeBob:	 Wow, thanks for your help, Squidward. 
Squidward:	 Hmph. I bet I win at this thing the very next time I try. Now all I have to do is… 
Mr. Krabs:	  At a quarter a pop, this thing pays for itself in no time.
Squidward:	 Ha! I'm not falling for that malarkey. 
SpongeBob:	  Hey, Squidward.  Hey, Squidward.  Hey, Squidward.  Okay, Mrs. Wiggles, order up. Beary cooked this one all by himself. Oh, he makes me so proud.

SpongeBob:	 Money, money, money, money, money!
Mr. Krabs:	 I took the liberty of turning your paycheck...  ...into quarters. Just in case you wanna... oh, I don't know, do laundry or  buy a soda or... something.
Squidward:	 Very funny, Mr. Krabs. If I can't win one of those stupid things with this quarter, I'm walking away.
Narrator:	  Six hours later…
SpongeBob:	  Pardon me, Squidward. SpongeBear, Jr. here wants me to win him a little brother.

Squidward:	  Uh-oh!
