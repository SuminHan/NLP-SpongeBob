Plankton:	 Okay, Karen. Which one's better? 
Karen:	 If I had eyes, I'd be rolling them right now.
Plankton:	  Oh, thanks for the help. Ya know, details like this can be very important to the customers.
Karen:	 Customers? What customers?
Plankton:	 Well, uh.....  ...like those customers, who just pulled up.  Well, hello, gentlemen, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Would you like seating inside or outside?
Pilar:	 Seating for what?
Plankton:	  For the Chum Bucket! Where you can enjoy a nice helping of chum.  Oh, boy this is so...  ...good. The chum is.
Nat:	 Wait a minute, eating chum? Do people do that?
Plankton:	 Look, are you gonna eat or not!?!?!
Nat:	 Yeah. I'll gonna have two Krabby Patties.
Pilar:	 Oh yeah, two.
Nat:	 We couldn't find parking over at the Krusty Krab. 
Plankton:	  Now what was I saying? Oh right . I'm tired of the Krusty Krab taking all of my buisness! We're doomed, Karen! Doomed, I tell you! 
Karen:	 Well, why don't you do what all good business owners do?
Plankton:	  What would that be?
Karen:	 Advertise your product, of course. 
Plankton:	 Advertising?  I can't believe it took me so long to come up with this 
Plankton:	  Now let's see, Q no... P no...Ah, here it is, L! There, it's perfect! CHUM IS METABOLIC FUEL!. You really did it this time ol' Planky. Oh yeah, who's a genius. ♪Have you seen this, seen this, seen my genius, genius, genius, genius.♪ 
Patrick:	 CHUM IS... ME...
Plankton:	 Hello sir, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Er, sir?
Patrick:	 ...META...A...TAB...TAB...AB...BOL...IC...
Mini Brain Patrick 1:	 Forget about what that word means! There's a fire breaking out the language lobes!
Mini Brain Patrick 2:	 We need to get outta here! 
Mini Brain Patrick 3:	 The door's jammed!
Mini Brain Patrick 2:	 Push harder! 
Patrick:	 ...METAB...BO... 
Plankton:	 Sir, your head, it's on fire.  THE DRINK, USE THE DRINK!
Patrick:	  It's kelp juice, you want some? . HEY! What kind of friend are you?
Plankton:	 Friend? I didn't even know y-
Patrick:	 Go ahead. Say you're sorry.
Plankton:	 Uh, I'm sorry
Patrick:	 Okay, I forgive you. And... I'm sorry for yelling. Okay, so can I tell you something honestly?
Plankton:	 Whatever.
Patrick:	 It's about your sign. These words make my head sad.
Patrick's Head:	  I don't get it. 
Patrick:	 It's okay little fella I don't either.
Plankton:	 OK, Freakshow, you just wait. In a few minutes this sign will attract more than you can count.
Narrator:	 A Few Minutes Later.
Patrick:	 Uhh, what's that number before one?
Plankton:	 Zero
Patrick:	 Oh right, congratulations, you have zero customers!
Plankton:	 Okay so it may take a little longer than a few minutes.
Narrator:	 A Little Longer Than a Few Minutes Later
Patrick:	 Wait, what are we doing again?  There we go! Chum is Fun!
Plankton:	 What the? This says "Chum is Fum." You've changed my sign to "Chum is Fum?" That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Patrick:	 They seem to think it's interesting. 
Plankton:	 Apparently, dumb sells chum. And I believe I've just found our Advertising Director. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Only two customers? Customers are looking kinda scarce. . Must be low tide or something, eh Squidward?
Squidward:	 They've all gone to the Chum Bucket.
Mr. Krabs:	 The Chum Bucket?  "Chum...is...Fum?" SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Yes Sir?
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, we have a situation.
SpongeBob:	 I'm on it. .
SpongeBob:	  Five. 
SpongeBob:	 Four. 
SpongeBob:	 Three. 
SpongeBob:	 Two. 
SpongeBob:	 One. 
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, I'm afraid our worst fears have been realized.
SpongeBob:	 Ah! Goofy Goober is going non-dairy?
Mr. Krabs:	 No. 
SpongeBob:	 Ooh. Slide Show.
Mr. Krabs:	  A few hours ago, the Chum Bucket was, as it should be, a desolate no-man's land.  There's only one way he could have changed things around so quickly.  Plankton must have slipped into the Krusty Krab while you weren't looking.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, that's my legs.
Mr. Krabs:	  He stole the Formuler. 
SpongeBob:	 
Mr. Krabs:	 I thought you'd say that.  So we need to infiltrate the Chum Bucket and steal the formular back.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, how you holding up boy?
SpongeBob:	 Not so good, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hold on now. We're almost there.
Narrator:	 Two Hours Later.
Plankton:	 Next!
Mr. Krabs:	 We made it SpongeBob. We're in! 
Nat:	 All I know is: Chum is Fum.
Pilar:	 You said it. Chum is Fum.
Mr. Krabs:	 Keep an eye peeled for anything suspiciourous
SpongeBob:	  Like that door? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Eh...BINGO! Giddy up boy, We're almost there. 
Patrick:	 Huh?
Plankton:	 Excuse me, would you like a free sample?
Mr. Krabs:	 No, uh  I'm full thanks!
Plankton:	 No? How 'bout your little friend? Hi SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Hi! I don't want a free sampl-
Plankton:	  Sure you do. LOOK OUT! SHE'S GONNA BLOW!!!
SpongeBob:	 Blegh, Aheh, Agh, Agheh 
Mr. Krabs:	 Huh? Well he obviously didn't steal me formular, but how did he steal all my customers?
Pilar:	 This Chum Tastes awful.
Nat:	 Yeah, but the slogan is so catchy that we can't stop eatin' it.
Nat and Pilar:	 CHUM IS FUM! 
Plankton:	 Ah hehehehehehe  Chum is fum! Ah he he!
Mr. Krabs:	  Come on SpongeBob...
Plankton:	 I'm gonna see how our advertising guru is doing.  What brilliant slogans have you come up with this week Patrick? 
Patrick:	  Hm, huh?
Plankton:	  Gah! You're supposed to be coming up with witty catchphrases to keep that rabble out there happy!  Chum is Fum...We kinda got that one already. 
Patrick:	 OOH I like that one!
Plankton:	 Agh. Oh well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Keep up the good work...I guess...
Patrick:	 You got it boss!
Plankton:	  HEY EVERYONE! CHUM IS FUM!
Plankton:	 Hey Karen, check this out!
Karen:	 What now?
Plankton:	 You see, every time I make a sale the sound goes there, Watch! 
Mr. Krabs:	 
Karen:	 How is that gonna help to boost sales?
Plankton:	 Karen, babe, you don't need help when you have a catchy slogan like mine.
Karen:	 Don't look now, but I think your catchy slogan days are numbered.
Plankton:	 
Nat:	  Uhh...something's not right.
Pilar:	 Yeah, I know, I keep sayin' "Chum is Fum" but it...ehh...it's just not workin'.
Nat:	 I'm outta here. 
Pilar:	 
Plankton:	 Hmmmm....
Plankton:	  PATRICK!
Patrick:	  Huh?!
Plankton:	 We're having a board meeting here! We need ideas!
Patrick:	  Hmmmm, Mhmmmm, Uh huuuh. I think I see the problem. Your potty has a shocky thing in it.
Plankton:	 NO! That's not it you FOOL! We need a new slogan! You need to come up with another genius catchphrase like "Chum is Fum" but different.
Patrick:	 Oh... Gotcha. Hmmmmmm.
Narrator:	 3 Days Later
Nat:	 I'm so happy that they changed that old tired slogan, "Chum is Fum".
Pilar:	 Yeah, that new slogan "Fum is Chum" is way cooler.
Nat:	 Way cooler!
Plankton:	  Here's your Chum Bucket Supreme, enjoy! Patrick my boy, you really earned that promotion!
Patrick:	  Thanks boss.
Plankton:	 Nothing can stop me now!
Plankton:	 You fellas look hungry, here you go! 
Patrick:	 Excuse me sir.  My resignation. 
Plankton:	 But you're my whole marketing department.
Patrick:	 I know but I'm "burned out." See? Anyway, you can send my check to my home.
Plankton:	  Check? You want money for those stupid catchphrases? Anybody can sell to my idiot customers  They're buffoons, morons, they'll buy anything I sell them. They're the dumbest of the dumb,  the stupidest of the stupid,  they're dummies, dweebs and doodoo dunderheads. I can keep that rabble right where I want 'em! Huh?
Hockey Player:	 What was that part about doodoo dunderheads, eh?
Hockey Player:	 Where do you think you're going little man?
Plankton:	 Is it too late for sorry?  D'OH!
Hockey Player:	  Hey, check out that new sign at the Krusty Krab. Who's hungry, eh?
SpongeBob:	 Well, Mr. K., we're back in business!
Mr. Krabs:	 Yep.  Keep up the good work boy'o!
Patrick:	 You got it boss!
