SpongeBob:	 The Story of  King Neptune.  When King Neptune was a little Neptune, his mother sent him adrift in a river. As he floated along, a giant meteor fell on Earth. An alien appeared, and inflicted the baby with Super Neptune Fluid.  By the time he was in school, he had already begun excibiting signs of super-duperness. As an adult, he would fly through the sea, helping people, and getting snails off of sea-trees. 
Patrick:	  Is that really the  origin of King Neptune?
SpongeBob:	 Sure.
