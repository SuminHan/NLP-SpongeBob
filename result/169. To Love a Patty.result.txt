SpongeBob:	 ♪Someday, I'm going to make you sweetie. Not overtly, but sur-rep-titious-ly.♪ Drum solo!  ♪Dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga—doo. Doo, doo, doo, Doo. Doo!♪ Hey, looks like you guys and gals are done.  In all my years of fry cookery, I have never seen a group of patties. Especially— you.  Such perfection from your little lettuce hair to your rosy ketchup cheeks right down to your mustard smile. May I call you— Patty?
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, I need that order of six.
SpongeBob:	 Here you go, Squidward. One, two, three and four, and uh— five and six.  That's it. That's the whole order, Squidward. There isn't a Krabby Patty behind my back or anything. 
Squidward:	 Uh— yeah.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Patty, a patty like you comes around once in a lifetime. I can't let them eat you. No, the job must come first. I can't let emotions cloud my commitment to the sacred fry cook oath: "That which is fried, must be eaten."
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, where is that other— oh, there it is. 
Muscular Guy #1:	  Where's my Krabby Patty?
Squidward:	 Right here, muscleboy.
Muscular Guy #1:	 It's about time. 
SpongeBob:	  I won't let you do this to Patty.
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, hand over the Krabby—
SpongeBob:	  Oh, Patty, I can't let them eat you. Your beauty must be preserved.  Amazing.
Squidward:	  What are you going to do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on her? Go out for a romantic walk with it? 
SpongeBob:	 Great idea. 
Squidward:	  I wonder if it's too late to get a refund from my therapist.
SpongeBob:	  Enjoy, sir.
Muscular Guy #1:	 Can I eat this one?  Hey, how'd they know? I loved grilled shoe. 
SpongeBob:	 What's cooking there, Patty? Oh, are you kidding? I love crepes. Oh, Patty, when we're together, I feel like we're in our own little world like, like— nothing can hurt us.  Fire!  Fire! Fire!
Gary:	  Meow. 
SpongeBob:	 It's okay, Patty, the fire's gone. You're safe now.  Oh, I better, uh— get the doorbell. 
Patrick:	  SpongeBob, how about another game of—  tie your best buddy in knots.  My turn.
SpongeBob:	 Sorry, Patrick.  I already made plans to go for a walk through Jellyfish Fields with Patty. As soon as the little lady dries her hair, we're heading out.
Sandy:	 Hi-yah!  Hey, SpongeBob, you didn't forget about our plan to go a-choppin', did you?
SpongeBob:	 Sorry, Sandy. No time for karate today. After our walk, I'm going for a rowboat ride with Patty. Just waiting for her to put on her makeup. You know how long it takes a Krabby Patty to get ready.
Sandy:	 Well, that makes as much sense as a snake with no slither. Patties are put in the water for eating, SpongeBob. Not for bebopping all over Timbuktu.
SpongeBob:	  Patty. Yeah, well, you two have fun with that.  Patty and I have to be on our way.
Patrick:	 I've been replaced by a sandwich!  Maybe I could meet a lovely sandwich of my own. Yeah, that'll show SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob:	 ♪Oh, baby. They may call me a fool. But I can't help our gravitational pull. When I stuff you with cotton candy, it reminds me you're so sweet. When we go riding, it's dandy. The way you hang onto that seat. Ba-ay-ay-by.♪  ♪When I'm with you, Our love is stronger than glue. Oh, baby! There isn't anything. There's nothing in the world, I wouldn't do for you—♪  Hey, let go of her, you Patty-eaters! No! Get away! Hi-yah! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Yah! Yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hiiiiyah! Patty, you okay, sweetums? ♪I'm so— sorry! I'll never let you out of my sight again. And I'll always keep you out of harm's way—♪  ♪Oh, baby. Our love is so strong. That's why I'm singing this song. Ba-ay-ay-by. Your looks are sweeter than honey. From your pickles to your buns. It ain't even funny—!♪  I'm coming for you!  Oh, no! Look at you! Don't worry, Patty! I'll take care of this!  There you go! ♪All better— Oh, baby!♪  Oh, Patty. Do you realize what this signifies? Mm-hmm. That's right. It's our six-hour anniversary. And do you know what that means? Are you all right, Patty? You don't seem so hot. Don't worry, I know what'll make you feel better. A dinner at the finest restaurant in Bikini Bottom. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Squidward! Where the barnacles is our fry cook? He's been gone all day. That boy's never been a work shirker. We got a crowd of hungry customers waiting.
Squidward:	 How should I know? Do I look like my idiot's keeper?
Mr. Krabs:	 Well— actually— 
SpongeBob:	 Good day, sir.
Squidward:	 As if on cue.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, what's with the fancy getup?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I just got gussied up for my special dinner date.
Mr. Krabs:	 A dinner date? Well, blow me down, boy. I didn't know you had it in you. so when do we get to meet the little lady?  By the way, is she rich?
SpongeBob:	 She's rich in taste.
Squidward:	 How could you possibly date anyone? I mean, look at you. She must be blind. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh, a limousine.
SpongeBob:	 There she is.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, I can smell the money already.
SpongeBob:	  Here we are, darling. The best eatery in town. 
Martha Smith:	 Harold, again?
Harold Smith:	 Martha, I know what you're thinking. It's not me this time.
Martha Smith:	 Well, whatever it is, it's disgusting.
Harold Smith:	 Let's get out of here. 
Martha Smith:	 Yuck.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, Squidward— allow me to introduce my date— Patty.
Mr. Krabs:	 Your date's a Krabby Patty? Me thinks the boy's really lost it.
Squidward:	  What's that putrid odor?
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh, it's that Krabby Patty.  What are you doing with that rotten piece of meat, boy?
SpongeBob:	 This isn't a piece of meat, Mr. Krabs. She's Patty.  And we're on a special date tonight so you don't mind if we get the "manager's treatment," do you?
Mr. Krabs:	 Sorry, boy. no can do.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, really? Mr. Fiver says different. 
Mr. Krabs:	 What was that? I couldn't hear you.
SpongeBob:	  How about now?
Mr. Krabs:	 All right, take a seat. 
SpongeBob:	 Grrrrrazie!  Here you go, my dear. A throne befitting a queen.  Oh, good evening, monsieur. What might we have on the menu at this fine establishment?
Squidward:	 Well, you should know considering the fact you work here, sod for brains. Speaking of sods— why don't you get rid of this garbage? It's starting to stink up the joint.
SpongeBob:	 Don't say such a thing, Squidward. Patty's just a little sick is all. Wight, Wubbie-Lubbie.
Squidward:	 I'll show you sick. 
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, what are you doing with my beautiful patty?
Squidward:	 Beautiful, huh? How beautiful do you think this is? 
SpongeBob:	  Stop it, Squidward. Maybe you can't see Patty's beauty. But to me, she's the most gorgeous creature in the sea.
Squidward:	 Well, I definitely see I can't the mentally atrophied. Good-bye, Creature.
SpongeBob:	 Pay you no mind to that, wubbie-wubbie. I will always love you—  Yeah, what is that smell?  Patty?  What happened to you?
Mr. Krabs:	 I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does.  Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean. She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty. And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat. So— I did. do you hear what I'm saying to you, boy?
SpongeBob:	 Um, not quite, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten. That's what they're put in the ocean for. And it looks like yours is way past due.
SpongeBob:	 I see now. I see what I must do.  Oh, Patty, my darling. Before I do this, I want you to know that I only do it out of love. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well done, boy. As a reward for your valiant effort, I'll only charge you 25¢ for the patty. Employee discount.
SpongeBob:	  Can I get a doggie bag with that?
