Band Member #1:	 Man, this is gonna be our most rocking tour, ever.
Band Member #2:	  Yeah.
Ned:	 Hey dudes, check out the debut of my new look. 
Band Member #1:	 Whoa, what's that on your head?
Band Member #3:	 Yeah, is that a wig or a pile of toilet paper?
Ned:	 C'mon guys, give it a chance.
Band Member #2:	 Let me try it on. 
Ned:	 Hey, you've revealed my shiny dome!
Band Member #2:	 Hot potato. Catch! 
Ned:	 Give it back, man!
Band Member #2:	 If you want it, you gotta catch it, dude. 
Band Member #1:	 Oops.
Ned:	 Ah! Oh, man, my beautiful wig! 
SpongeBob:	  I'm ready! I'm ready, I'm rea...  Ah, what is this? Curly tresses, poofy texture,  itchy scalp...  it's a wig!  Hi, Patrick. How do you like my new wig?
Patrick:	  I'll save you. 
SpongeBob:	 Pa... trick... what are... you doing?
Patrick:	 I'm saving you from that brain-eating alien that's attacking your...  ...head!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you!
Patrick:	  Oh, sorry.
SpongeBob:	 It's ok.  Why did you do that?
Patrick:	  Well, I thought it was a new type of cotton candy you wear on your head.
SpongeBob:	 Well, it's not, but that is an excellent idea.
Patrick:	 Then what is it?
SpongeBob:	 It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig.
Patrick:	 A wig?  Oh, boy. Don't you think that's a little silly?  Oh, man, it's time for my weekly condiment soak.  Do you mind? 
Fish #1:	 Nice wig. 
SpongeBob:	 Thanks. I am very fashionable today.
Tina:	 Hey SquareFashion, nice couture.
SpongeBob:	 Why, thank you.
Pilar:	 So then...  Huh...?
Peterson:	 Nice do, SpongeBob. 
Pilar:	 Yeah, where can I get one? 
Sally:	 Whoa. That wig really suits you. 
SpongeBob:	  Hi, Squidward!
Squidward:	  Who? What? Where? What? How?
SpongeBob:	 Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh?
Squidward:	 Nope.
SpongeBob:	 I'm wearing a wig.
Squidward:	 Oh yeah, how could I have missed it?
SpongeBob:	 Can you believe I found it lying around in the street?
Squidward:	 Umm...maybe.
SpongeBob:	 If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you.
Squidward:	 I can't wait.
SpongeBob:	 Wig away!  Order up, Squidward. 
Squidward:	 Mr. Krabs!  I've served a lot of junk here, but a hair patty?
Mr. Krabs:	  SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Mr. Krabs? 
Mr. Krabs:	 What in Davy Jones' locker is on your head, son?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, that's my new wig, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, take it off. The hair's getting into the patties.
SpongeBob:	 Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy.
Mr. Krabs:	 Happy?
SpongeBob:	 Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face.
Mr. Krabs:	 I can imagine.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, if it means that much to ya, you can keep it. But you gotta wear a hairnet.  And if I see one more hairy patty, your wig goes in the dumpster.
SpongeBob:	 
Sandy:	 There you are, SpongeBob. Are you ready for karate prac...tice? 
SpongeBob:	 I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh?
Sandy:	 Wig's... uh great...SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob:	 Glad you like it.  I'll see you later, Sandy.  Two krabby patties and a side order of looking good.
Frank:	 Nice wig.
Abigail:	 Like to keep in style, huh?
SpongeBob:	 You know it.
Francis:	 Off to meet the queen, Sir Nerdlaroy?
SpongeBob:	 Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance.  Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs.
Jimmy:	 How 'bout a little off the top?
Tom:	 Yeah, your wig is big enough to go around.
SpongeBob:	 This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous.  Squidward, I'll be hiding in the kitchen if you need me.
Squidward:	 Hide your shame, SpongeBob. Hide your shame. 
Record Producer:	 Well, well, well, Ned and the Needlefish. You're fired.
Band:	 Fired?!
Band Member #2:	 But why?
Record Producer:	 Ask Baldy McBalderson over here.
Band:	 Ned!
Band Member #2:	 Good going, dude.
Ned:	 I can't help it not having hair.
Band Member #3:	 When we formed this band, it was for one reason and one reason only: to make a lot of money. And you not having hair is getting in the way of that.
Record Producer:	 We are selling records, not denture cream.  Either you come back with hair or don't come back at all. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Time to go home, boys.
SpongeBob:	  Almost finished.  See, Squidward, it's functional, too.
Squidward:	 It's about as functional as your brain.
SpongeBob:	  Thank you, Squidward.
Squidward:	 That wasn't a compliment! The entire town is laughing at you!
SpongeBob:	 I don't understand.
Squidward:	  Just look at yourself.
SpongeBob:	 Hello, handsome.  Sss.
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before.
SpongeBob:	 Hmmm, I've never been tall before.
Squidward:	 That wig is infested with parasites. 
SpongeBob:	 That tickles.
Squidward:	 Can't you see how ridiculous you look?
SpongeBob:	 I think that it looks cool.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hahahaha. You wouldn't know cool if I locked you in the freezer. 
SpongeBob:	 For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work.
SpongeBob:	 But Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs:	 No but's.
SpongeBob:	 So I can't have a wig or a butt?
Mr. Krabs:	 No, SpongeBob, it means until you get rid of that wig, get your butt out of here. 
Sandy:	 I never got a chance to talk to SpongeBob yesterday. I was laughing too hard.  SpongeBob? Huh?
SpongeBob:	 Hi, Sandy. What do you think?
Sandy:	 We need to talk. 
SpongeBob:	 Why would I want to get rid of my wig? Look at how happy it makes everybody. 
Sandy:	 Well, it does attract a lot of attention.
SpongeBob:	 I know. People just can't keep their eyes off of me.
Sandy:	 Neither can I, SpongeBob. 
Martha:	 It's true, John, this isn't my real hair! I stole it!!! 
SpongeBob:	 Oops. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. [along with an angry Nazz] Hey, the wig broke my fall!  Mmm, popcorn.  Ah, you always come through for me.
Dale:	  Hey buddy, do you mind?
SpongeBob:	 Shhh! It's very rude to talk during a movie! [growling]
Sandy:	 Umm, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	  You, too, Sandy. People are trying to watch the movie.
Sandy:	 Well, they can't. Look, your stupid wig is blocking the whole screen. 
All:	  Fish #1: Take it off, Jerk!; Fish #2: Hey!; Fish #3: Hey! Down in front!; Fish #4: Take the wig off!
SpongeBob:	 People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot.
Scooter:	 That's a great idea! Let's start a riot. 
SpongeBob:	 
Frank:	  I told you that movie was terrible.
Sandy:	 Now do you see what I'm saying, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too.
Sandy:	 It's time to be strong.
SpongeBob:	 I know.  I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you!
Sandy:	 Hurry up, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me.  I'll never accessorize again.
Sandy:	 You did the right thing, SpongeBob. 
Ned:	 Where am I gonna get some hair? My career is ruined. Ruined!  Can it be? It is! My wig. Yes! Victory is mine.
SpongeBob:	 Wigs. Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere.
Debbie:	 Oh, he's got your hair.
Shubie:	 Thank you.
Patrick:	  SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig.
Patrick:	 Look at my new wig. 
SpongeBob:	 Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool.
Fish #1:	 Yeah, they were. But look... 
SpongeBob:	 Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else?
Fish #1:	 Yes, you were. But not anymore. See ya! 
SpongeBob:	 I wish I had a wig. 
Patrick:	 Don't be sad, SpongeBob. You can borrow one of mine.  Just wash it before you return it.
