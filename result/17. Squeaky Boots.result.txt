Mr. Krabs:	  ♪Yar-har, Pearl's my daughter, I'll spit in your eye! Yo-ho, Pearl's a whale, and it's her birthday, yar-yar-yar!♪ Ta-da!
Pearl:	 Thanks for the show, Dad. Now can we open the presents?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, all right. Presents for me darling little sardine. It's from me. 
Pearl:	 Oh you shouldn't have. What is it, Daddy? It wouldn't be those totally hip new flipper slippers all my friends are using, would it? Everyone wants them.
Mr. Krabs:	 Uhh... well, they might be.
Pearl:	 Whee!  Oh, you shouldn't have, yay, you shouldn't have.  I mean, Dad,  you really shouldn't have! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Pearl, these are the finest fishin' boots available!
Pearl:	 Dad, you ruined me! 
Mr. Krabs:	 But I got them for a bargain!  Oh, what am I gonna do? I spent two whole dollars on these boots and now I'm stuck with them!
SpongeBob:	  Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBoy, me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddie! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots.  So you want to get paid?
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots  are in  the way.
Mr. Krabs:	  In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.
SpongeBob:	 Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.
SpongeBob:	 Who's that?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry.
SpongeBob:	 ♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪
Mr. Krabs:	 Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable. 
SpongeBob:	 Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
Mr. Krabs:	 Paycheck! You got a deal--
SpongeBob:	 And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
Mr. Krabs:	 You've got a deal.
SpongeBob:	 And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!
Mr. Krabs:	 You got a...
SpongeBob:	 And... 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hold on there, lad! You're gonna give me a heart attack!  You got yourself a deal.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook!
Squidward:	 That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!
Mr. Krabs:	 Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music.
Mr. Krabs:	  Five, ten, twenty, thirty...  Wha? Who's there?  Back to countin' me money.  One, two, three, four, five...  What the barnacle is that?  Arrgh, that was the worst night I ever weathered. At least I'll have some peace and quiet at work. 
Squidward:	 That's it, Mr. Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now.
Mr. Krabs:	  What's wrong, Mr. Squid-ard?
Squidward:	 I can't take the world's greatest fry cook anymore! I'll see you in a week. 
Mr. Krabs:	 That fry cook's making me a fortune. What could be the problem?
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob. 
Mr. Krabs:	 I... uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots.
SpongeBob:	 Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, I don't... uhh... I don't... uhh...
SpongeBob:	 Or could he do this?  Or this?  And watch this, Mr. Krabs! 
Squeaky Boots:	 May I take your order?
Francis:	 Yeah, I'll have the Krusty Special.
Squeaky Boots:	 Thank you, sir. I will squeak when it's ready.
SpongeBob:	 Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 I, uhh...
SpongeBob:	 And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this. 
Mr. Krabs:	   I gotta go to my office!  I can still hear it!  It's still coming through! The infernal squeak!  Those boots have got to go! And I need an aspirin.
SpongeBob:	 Gary, these boots have changed my life. I'm never taking them off.
Gary:	  Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Good night, Gary.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ah, quiet money. Silence and money. 
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 What is it, my boy?
SpongeBob:	  Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!
Mr. Krabs:	 It's okay, son.
SpongeBob:	  No, it's not okay! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hold it, boy! It's not the end of the world.
SpongeBob:	 Yes, it is!
Mr. Krabs:	 Look, don't cry. I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts! 
SpongeBob:	  They're not the ! You were right. I wasn't ready for those blessed boots. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Poor lad. 
Tom:	 Excuse me?
Mr. Krabs:	 I didn't do it!  Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?
Tom:	 Yeah, I'm ready to order.
Mr. Krabs:	  What'll ya have?

SpongeBob:	 Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.
SpongeBob:	 You really think so, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 I do, son.  Here's the paycheck I owe you.  Plus a bonus!  Well, there's your paycheck anyway.  I need a vacation.
SpongeBob:	 Bye, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl.
Pearl:	  Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!
Mr. Krabs:	 Darling, I won't.  Oh, no.
