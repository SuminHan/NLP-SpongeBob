Narrator:	 And now, Astrology with Squidward.
Squidward:	 This is Leo, sign of the lion. Hear him roar... The typical Leo has the voice as pleasant as a dental drill. If you have a Leo in your family, I suggest you move out or buy earmuffs. Leos often grow up to be junior high school vice principals! My prediction for Leo in the 12 months ahead, everyone you know will turn one year older! I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon astrologer, saying my powers are as real as any other psychics, and I'm a cartoon.
