TV Announcer:	 We interrupt this program to bring you a Bikini Bottom News Flash!
Plankton:	 Whoa, big fella!
Perch Perkins:	 Mr. Plankton, we've received a word that you're plotting to infiltrate the Krusty Krab and steal the Krabby Patty secret formula.  Is that true?
Plankton:	  Actually, yes, that is true. I've got it all worked out.  First I break into the safe, and...  Huh? Wait, is this live?
Perch Perkins:	 Yes!
Plankton:	 Don't broadcast my secret plans! They're secret!  I will destroy all of you! 
Plankton:	 Secret formula, ho! 
Plankton:	  I reckon that classified taste mixture will be in my hands directly. 
Plankton:	  Ow!  The fool! He left the safe open! 
Plankton:	 Open for business, baby! 
Mr. Krabs:	  Gotcha! 
Plankton:	 Urrgh!
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm off to make a delivery. 
Plankton:	 Ha, that fool!
Plankton:	 And the Krabby Patty is made of...
Plankton:	 Urchins!
Karen:	 Ew! Ew! 
Mr. Krabs:	  Gotcha! 
Plankton:	 Yoink!
Customer:	 Huh?
Plankton:	  Yes!
Mr. Krabs:	 Pull!
Mr. Krabs:	 Yee-haw! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Gotcha! 
Mr. Krabs:	  Gotcha.
Plankton:	 Whee!  Come to daddy, patty!
Mr. Krabs:	  Gotcha. 
Plankton:	 Oh, Karen, he covered me in urchins, fed me to a seahorse, and stung me to death! I fly through the air, he flies through the air! I hide in a stomach, he hides in a stomach! I have had enough!
Karen:	 Oh, I think someone needs their ba-ba.  There, isn't that better?
Plankton:	  No, Karen! That's just not gonna work anymore! Don't you see? We're done here.
Karen:	 He said for the 9 billionth time. You know, Sheldon, if I had a dime for every time you... 
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, did you see that? Plankton is retiring.
Mr. Krabs:	 I'll believes it when I sees it.
Mr. Krabs:	  Hey, ha ha!  All hands on deck, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Aye-aye, Mr.â€”Whoa!
SpongeBob:	 Aw, you want to say good-bye to Plankton, you old softy you.
Mr. Krabs:	 That'll be the day! I don't trust Plankton as far as I throw him! That's why we're gonna shadow that little twit and find out what he's up to!
French Narrator:	 82 kilometers later...
SpongeBob:	 "Welcome to Dullsville, a charmingly boring..."
Mr. Krabs:	  Snap your trap, boy-o! You'll blow our cover!
Plankton:	 A new life in a new town! 
SpongeBob:	 I still don't see Plankton doing anything wrong. Maybe he really is retiring.
Mr. Krabs:	 Believes it when I sees it.
Mr. Krabs:	 Quick, boy, he's getting away!
Clerk:	 Yes?
Plankton:	 I'd like a room, please.
Clerk:	 Very good, sir.  How long will you be staying with us?
Plankton:	 Forever. 
Plankton:	 And so begins my retirement! 
Mr. Krabs:	 You see there, lad? Plankton is up to no good! I bet those are all the fixings for another evil lab.
SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs, I'm gonna be sick.
Plankton:	  Yes!  Yes! 
Mr. Krabs:	 You see? He's got an evil belt to match those evil shoes!
Plankton:	 Yes! My plan is almost complete! 
Mr. Krabs:	 His plan!  Did you hear that, SpongeBob? He said, "plan!"
SpongeBob:	 Uh, please don't shake me, Mr. Krabs.
Plankton:	 Oh, my pretty. You'll be my best friend from now on.  Retirement is mine! Mine! Mine! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh, this is it, boy-o. He's got an evil laser death apparatus contraption ready to spring on all of us!
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh.
Mr. Krabs:	 Now that I sees it, I believes it.
SpongeBob:	 Hurray! I knew you'd get it, Mr.  Krabs! 
Plankton:	 Krabs?! What are you doing in my hotel room?!
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh.  Good luck on your retirement, Plankton. I won't give you any more trouble.
Plankton:	 Oh, I know you won't, Krabs, because I'm at the Krusty Krab right now stealing that formula.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh-oh, sure. Whatever you say, old-timer. How would you be doing that when you're all the way over here in Dullsville, hmm?
Plankton:	  Because I'm a decoy look-alike robot!
Robot Plankton:	 Gotcha! 
SpongeBob:	  So what'd I miss?
Both:	 What?!
Plankton:	  That's right, Karen. By the time those two knuckleheads figure it out, I'll be knee-deep in secret formula.  Yes, I'll wear my galoshes. Gotta go.
Plankton:	 In your face, Krabs! Ha!
Plankton:	 Krabs? SpongeBoob? W-w-why aren't you in Dullsville?
Mr. Krabs:	 We never left, Sheldon. The Mr. Krabs and SpongeBoob who followed the robot you to Dullsville were also robots. Gotcha! 
Plankton:	  Hate! Hate!  Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!
Robot SpongeBob:	 So the way I see it, Mr. Krabs and Plankton are just using us as pawns in their dumb secret formula war.
Robot Plankton:	 Agreed.
Robot Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah, I mean, who cares if that guy steals the secret formula anyway? Grow up, that's what I say.
Robot Plankton:	 Agreed.
Plankton:	 So you're the real Krabs and SpongeBob.  Gimme that! 
Both:	 Ooh. 
SpongeBob:	  Hello? Krusty Krab, make I take your order? No, Mr. Krabs is unable to come to the phone right now. He's trapped under a dust cloud brawl. Yeah, he'll have to call you back.  Gee, I hope our robot look-alikes are okay. Bless their heart-like pneumatic pumps.
Robot Plankton, Robot SpongeBob, and Robot Mr. Krabs:	 Yay!
