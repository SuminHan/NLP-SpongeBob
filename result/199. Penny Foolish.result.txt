Debbie:	 Price check on industrial size econo pack of raw fiber.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ah, it goes in like steel wool, but comes out like an angel from heaven.
Debbie:	  Please, tell me more.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh, well, this one time I...
Debbie:	 Not really!
Mr. Krabs:	 I didn't think so. Ooh wait, I almost forgot me coupons!  There's a couple double ones in there too.
Debbie:	 Sir, these expired over 30 years ago.
Mr. Krabs:	 What does that mean?
Debbie:	 It means they're no good, Sir. I'll just throw those away for you.
Mr. Krabs:	 No, wait! I'll take 'em.
Debbie:	 Okay sir, your change today is going to be exactly ten cents.
Mr. Krabs:	 Come to papa! Come to papa!  Yay! Two nickels.  Hey, that's SpongeBob out there!  What in blue blazes is that boy up to?  Well I'll be a geriatric jellyfish! SpongeBob found a penny! A bright shiny penny just sitting there, and he picked it right up! Huh, I can remember the whole thing as if it just happened a moment ago. 
SpongeBob:	  Sir... Sir! 
Debbie:	 ...Sir!
Mr. Krabs:	 What?
Debbie:	 You're holding up the line.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh, I am?
Debbie:	 Next, please. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Interesting how things work out that way. Some folks just walk along and stumble over free money, while others, others, they work! 
Billy:	 Hey mommy, who's that weird guy in the car over there!
Billy's Mom:	 Billy, mommy's watching the road right now.
Mr. Krabs:	 I mean why couldn't I have just walked along and found it? I have legs too you know!  How about a little music.  Okay, okay, get a grip Krabs. Just concentrate on driving.  Okay, getting all worked up over a little coin.  Ah, it must just be the full moon. Wait a second.  I gotta have that penny!  Good morning, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Good morning, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 Find anything special lately?
SpongeBob:	 Yae-yes!
Mr. Krabs:	 Really?
SpongeBob:	 Yup!
Mr. Krabs:	 And you want to share it with your old uncle Krabs, don't you boy?
SpongeBob:	 Of course!
Mr. Krabs:	 Great! Well, share it with me!
SpongeBob:	  I already am sharing it with you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Wha.. What?
SpongeBob:	 The thing I found was a bright, shiny, new... day! Well I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.  Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward:	 Don't talk to me.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs seems to be in a good mood today.
Squidward:	 That counts as talking. 
SpongeBob:	 Whoa! Hello again Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 What can I do you for?
Mr. Krabs:	 Can I borrow a penny?
SpongeBob:	 A penny? Sure.  Hmm, sorry. All out of pennies right now.
Mr. Krabs:	 But did you check all your pockets?
SpongeBob:	 Well, I thought I did.
Mr. Krabs:	 Front pockets? 
SpongeBob:	 Hmm, no.
Mr. Krabs:	 Back? 
SpongeBob:	 Hmm-mm.
Mr. Krabs:	 Shirt pockets? 
SpongeBob:	 Nuh-uh.
Mr. Krabs:	 Shoe pockets?
SpongeBob:	  Shoe pockets. Oh, Mr. Krabs, that is just ridiculous.
Mr. Krabs:	 It is?
SpongeBob:	 Well, I do have a tie pocket though.  No, not in there either.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, maybe it fell in your sock.
SpongeBob:	 Well, I...
Mr. Krabs:	 Did you check there?  Uhh?
SpongeBob:	 Hey look, it's my brain!  Hey where's it going?  Ooh, there.  Aha!  Not so fast, little guy. There now. Yes, I know. Come here. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Uhh?
SpongeBob:	 What's the matter Mr. Krabs? Didn't you know I was a brain whisperer?
Mr. Krabs:	 So, uhh, no penny, huh?
Mr. Krabs:	 Darn! 
SpongeBob::	 Squidward, these deafening construction sounds are preventing me from working.
Squidward:	 Me too.
SpongeBob:	 Do you think we should walk out back to investigate?
Squidward:	 Never. 
SpongeBob:	 The sounds are coming from back here. What the? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Careful with those marquee ladders!
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Mr. Krabs, you made your own movie theater!
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes I did.
SpongeBob:	 Yay!
Mr. Krabs:	 And you're just in time for the grand opening!  Step right up folks, and witness a spell binding tale chock full of adventure, and action, and thrills... 
Frank:	 You know, I'm not really hungry.
Harold:	 Yeah, let's go see what this fat guy is yelling about.
Mr. Krabs:	 ...witness the terrifying challenges overcome by... by...
Harold:	 By who?
Mr. Krabs:	 by a... by a plucky young sponge.
SpongeBob:	 Just like me!
Mr. Krabs:	 That's right! And the best part is: admission is only one penny!
Squidward:	 Does a movie like that even exist?
Harold:	 Yeah, does it?!
Mr. Krabs:	 Uhh, well, actually I was going to show you this flip book and...
Squidward:	 A flip book?
Harold:	 Yeah, I don't even know what that IS! 
Mr. Krabs:	 No, wait. Noooooooo!
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, can I see the movie now? Please?
Mr. Krabs:	 Of course you can lad! You just gotta give me one penny.
SpongeBob:	 But, but...
Mr. Krabs:	 But what?
SpongeBob:	 But, I really don't have a penny.  Huh, that's too bad. I really wanted to see that movie. Oh well. 
Squidward:	 Good evening,  and  welcome to the  Krusty Krab semi-annual charity night.
SpongeBob:	 Squidward? You look beautiful!
Squidward:	 Let me show you to your table.
SpongeBob:	 My table? Fancy.  My very own name tag! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hello, and welcome to a very important evening. Tonight's event is entitled: Pennies, for the penny-less. And before the following images are shown, I would ask each of you to look not look with your eyes, but with your heart.  Three dimes, two nickels, one quarter, zero pennies. And since I realize the images seen here tonight may be wretchedly hideous, I am going to tell you what you can do to end this travesty: You can donate one penny to me: Mr. Krabs. Also known as: Mr. Krabs, the man who doesn't have one. 
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	  Yes?
SpongeBob:	 I would like to donate a penny.
Mr. Krabs:	 You would?
SpongeBob:	 If I only had one! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hiding it, somewhere. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it.
Gary:	 Meow.
Mr. Krabs:	 What's that? You! You know where!
Gary:	 Meow. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Tell where!
Gary:	 Meow.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hiding it, inside,  in there, somewhere. 
SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs! What is this metal detector doing on the floor? These should only be stored on special racks.  And you're not wearing your metal detector handling gloves!
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, I just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, that wasn't a penny. 
Mr. Krabs:	 It wasn't?
SpongeBob:	 No, that was just a dried up piece of gum for my collection. I think it's peppermint.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. I fell so relieved. There was no penny after all! Well, I'll be going now, You can keep the metal detector, SpongeBob. See ya!
SpongeBob:	 Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Hey, Gary, you can play with that.  Hey, this isn't gum at all.  It's just a dumb old $500 bill. This won't go with my chewed up gum collection. Ah well, good night, Gary. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Penny, must have buried it around here somewhere. I'll just have to keep digging.
