Mr. Krabs:	 Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.
SpongeBob:	 Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?
Mr. Krabs:	 Fine?!  Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine. 
SpongeBob:	 Time off?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this...SpongeBob, take a vacation.
SpongeBob:	 Aye aye, Mr. Krabs. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, that went better than expected.
SpongeBob:	  I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary.
Gary:	 Meow?
SpongeBob:	 That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary.  Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.
Squidward:	 I thought you were on vacation.
Mr. Krabs:	  He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.
SpongeBob:	 What's a vacation?
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.
SpongeBob:	  No work?! But what'll I do all day?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.
SpongeBob:	 But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.
Squidward:	 Nor will I.
Mr. Krabs:	 That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.
Patrick:	  Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.
Mr. Krabs:	 Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.
SpongeBob:	 Replacement?
Patrick:	 Hi, SpongeBob.
Mr. Krabs:	 That's enough banter on my dime.
Patrick:	 Ok, boss.
Mr. Krabs:	 Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job. 
Patrick:	 Wow.  Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher.  Wow. It scratches backs, too!
Mr. Krabs:	 Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.
SpongeBob:	 I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique. 
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside! 
Squidward:	 Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.
SpongeBob:	 I'm not here to see you, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?
SpongeBob:	 I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick.
Mr. Krabs:	 Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.
SpongeBob:	 You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!
Patrick:	 Huh?
SpongeBob:	 You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs:	  SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?
SpongeBob:	 Wait, it's not what you think.
Mr. Krabs:	  Out you go, boy.
SpongeBob:	 But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs:	 We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, boy...  off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset. 
Squidward:	  SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.
SpongeBob:	 Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.
Mr. Krabs:	  SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over. 
SpongeBob:	  Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up. 
Squidward:	  I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.
SpongeBob:	 Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house. 
Squidward:	 Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.
Mr. Krabs:	 I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up.  Further.  Further.  Further.  Further.  That'll do.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here. 
Delivery Fish:	 Huh? What's the big idea, here? 
Patrick:	 Hello? Hello? Hello?  Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear.  Hey, I just cleaned that one.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, shhh.
Patrick:	 It talks! 
SpongeBob:	 Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh.
Mr. Krabs:	 Now what?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  I've had enough for one day, son. 
SpongeBob:	 Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Not a problem at all, me boy.
SpongeBob:	 Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.
Mr. Krabs:	 Uh-huh.
SpongeBob:	 My house is back that way, Mr. K.
Mr. Krabs:	 Far out, little man. Far out. 
SpongeBob:	 Where'd you say you were taking me?
Mr. Krabs:	 Look boy,  I brought your spatuler.  C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it!  Enjoy your vacation, boy!
SpongeBob:	 It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...  ...permanent vacation. That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known. Patrick's had his eye on my job all along. He's been scheming. They think I'm outdated. They think I'm all washed up. Well, I'll show them. 
Patrick:	 Working at the Krusty Krab. Making krabby patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember.  Huh?
SpongeBob:	  Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire like that? Like trash? I don't think so!
Patrick:	 SpongeBob? Is that you?
SpongeBob:	  I've been waiting for you, Patrick! 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh! 
Customer:	 One krabby patty, please.
Squidward:	 One shell on a shingle. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Why'd you do it, laddy?
SpongeBob:	  Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!
Mr. Krabs:	 You don't have to.  Your accumulated vacation time is used up.  The union can't fine me, anymore.
SpongeBob:	 You must've saved a fortune.
Mr. Krabs:	 Bumping barnacles, yes.  There she is.
SpongeBob:	 Wow! That's more than I make in a year.
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.
SpongeBob:	  Yippee! I happily acquiesce.
