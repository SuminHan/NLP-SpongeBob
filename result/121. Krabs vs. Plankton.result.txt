Plankton:	  And so passes another sleepless night, haunted by my inability to steal even a single Krabby Patty. 
Karen:	 Maybe today will be the day?
Plankton:	 Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife. 
Karen:	 Do you even have a plan?
Plankton:	 Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen?  I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula... 
SpongeBob:	 Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Look at you, Plankton. Once again you've fallen flat on your back in a pathetic attempt to steal me formula.  Though you've tried and tried, you haven't had the smallest nibble of my delicious formula.  And you never will!  How do you sleep at night, no wonder you're a complete failure? 
Charlie:	  There really should be a "Wet Floor" sign.
Nat Peterson:	 Yeah, if that were me who slipped, I'd sue old man Krabs for all he's got.
Plankton:	 Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?
Charlie:	 Of course.
Plankton:	  Oh, the pain! I can't feel my arms and legs! I think they're broken. I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering.
Mr. Krabs:	  Sue?!
Female Customer #1:	 Oh, that looks bad.
Dennis:	 Uh-oh.
Nazz:	 Poor little man.
Mr. Krabs:	 Wait! Hold up a second! Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?
Plankton:	 Well...if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence.
Mr. Krabs:	 Scoundrel! You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!
Plankton:	  See you in court, Krabs! Uh, I mean...  oh the pain! The deep-frying pain! 
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm in a blue ruin. I'm doomed!
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands.
Mr. Krabs:	 What I really need is a good lawyer.
Richard:	 Hello, did somebody say "lawyer"?  Richard A. Bottomfeeder, Attorney at Law. I couldn't help but notice that despicable display.
Mr. Krabs:	 So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?
Richard:	 Actually, I won't charge you a dime unless we win.
Richard:	 In fact, I think we should counter sue for everything Plankton owns.
Richard:	  Does that happen a lot?
SpongeBob:	 No, they're usually silver.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 What is it, lad?
SpongeBob:	 I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it.
Mr. Krabs:	 Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you. Why, you'll be more of a...  of a liability than an asset.
SpongeBob:	 But I...
Mr. Krabs:	 Ah, run along. Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration. I've got to get to the courthouse early. There's only a few free parking places. 
Richard:	 Oh, this is going to be a slam-dunk... 
SpongeBob:	 Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me!
Richard:	  Wracked...with pain...can't move.
SpongeBob:	 But what about Mr. Krabs' case?
Richard:	 Looks like you're going to have to handle this one, son.
SpongeBob:	 But, I'm a...a liability.
Richard:	 Everything you need to win  is in this here case. 
SpongeBob:	  Really? Everything?
Richard:	 Uh huh. Everything but a suit. 
SpongeBob:	 A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit.
Plankton:	  I'll give you one last chance. I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula.
Mr. Krabs:	  Never, you little runt! 
Plankton:	  Oww, oww! My wittle arm! 
Mr. Krabs:	 What? No. I didn't lay a claw on him.
Plankton:	 Oww! My other arm! 
Mr. Krabs:	 He's lying! Bah!
Tom:	 Court will come to order. The Honorable Judge Stickleback presiding.
Stickleback:	 Mr. Krabs, where is your attorney?
Mr. Krabs:	  I don't know where he could be.
SpongeBob:	 Here I am!
Stickleback:	 Thank you for joining us, Mr...uhh...
SpongeBob:	  SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor.
Mr. Krabs:	  What are you doing here, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry Mr. Krabs, I have everything under control. It's uhh, all in here  .
Mr. Krabs:	 Really?
SpongeBob:	 Yep, right in here. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Is there a problem?
SpongeBob:	 Umm...your lawyer didn't give me the combination.
Lawyer:	 Is the plaintiff ready to proceed?
Plankton:	 Yes, your honor. I'll try.  I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today.  I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell.
Mr. Krabs:	 Pull yourself together, boy.
Plankton:	 Then came the fateful day that I paid an innocent visit to the deathtrap known as the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs:	 How's it coming lad?
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case. 
Plankton:	 Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor  that had been intentionally  covered with a viscous fluid.
SpongeBob:	 Bombs away! 
Plankton:	 Ahem! Are you quite finished?  Now where was I, oh yeah. But the worst part is...my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed.  I'm...I'm sorry Gram-Gram...sorry.  Thank you for your kind attention.  Suckers.
Stickleback:	 Does the defense...  have an opening statement?
SpongeBob:	 Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram!
Plankton:	  Mr. Krabs, can you identify this item?
Mr. Krabs:	 It's a "wet floor" sign.
Plankton:	 Do you own one?
Mr. Krabs:	 Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't.  No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed superfluous?
Court Audience:	 Guilty. Guilty, guilty, guilty.
Plankton:	 No more questions.
Stickleback:	 Your witness, Mr. LawyerPants.
SpongeBob:	 Huh?
Stickleback:	 Sometime today, Mr. Pants.
SpongeBob:	 May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap , miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar  and dropped it in the blender ? 
Mr. Krabs:	 No! No-no! No!  Daddy's got ya. Daddy's got ya. Daddy's here.  A little glue, a little tape. It'll be right as rain.  Daddy didn't forget ya.
Stickleback:	 Does the defense have any witness to call?
SpongeBob:	 Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand.
Mr. Krabs:	  Ahh, Squidward, a loyal employee. 
SpongeBob:	 Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with the ludicrous statement?
Squidward:	 Yes.
Mr. Krabs:	 What!
SpongeBob:	 Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?
Squidward:	 Nope. Can I go now? One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying? 
Mr. Krabs:	  Must...open...case.
SpongeBob:	 So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it? 
SpongeBob:	 Answer the question!  Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm doomed.
Mr. Krabs:	 You may as well give up on that case, me boy. My goose is cooked.
SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you. We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case.  It's open! 
Mr. Krabs:	 It's...  It's just his lunch. Or is it? 
SpongeBob:	 Defense calls Plankton to the stand. 
SpongeBob:	 Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?
Plankton:	 To, you know. Say hello to my once good friend, Mr. Krabs. What?
SpongeBob:	 Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these?  Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty.
Plankton:	  Uhh...uhh...uhh  I can't take it! Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!  Yippee! Finally it's mine!
Mr. Krabs:	  I'll take that!
Plankton:	 Huh? No, no, no!
Mr. Krabs:	 Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp. 
Plankton:	 No, no, no, no!
Stickleback:	  Has the jury reached a verdict?
Tom:	 We have, your honor. We find the defendant not guilty...but he is cheap.
Mr. Krabs:	 Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning.
SpongeBob:	 That's OK, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present.
Mr. Krabs:	 A present? For me?
SpongeBob:	 Close your eyes and hold out your hand.  It's a "wet floor" sign. I made it myself.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, it'll do. After all, it's free!
