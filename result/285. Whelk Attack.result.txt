SpongeBob:	 Whoa! Do you think we caused an earthquake by hitting the ground too hard?
Patrick:	 Maybe. Or maybe it's those guys. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I've never seen those guys around before... 
Patrick:	 Ewwww! We're all covered in slime!
SpongeBob:	 Not to worry! I am a sponge after all!  Hold still, Patrick! 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, you're leaking.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, do you mind? I've gotta wring myself out.
Patrick:	 Say no more. 
SpongeBob:	  Ah! Oh! We've got to warn Bikini Bottom about those creatures!
Bikini Bottomites:	  Whelks! 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, what do we do?
Patrick:	 What are those things?
Johnny:	  Sea Whelks! Large sea snails are invading Bikini Bottom and are on the attack! They are eating everything and they spit purple slime!  Luckily, the news station is safe. This is Bikini Bottom News signing out. 
SpongeBob:	 Whelks? Heh, I'm not afraid of some goofy old sea snails!
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	  Oh, hey Gary!
Gary:	 Meow. 
SpongeBob:	 Gary can be a little bit creepy.
Patrick:	 Well, I'm not afraid of them! Watch this! 
Whelk:	 
Patrick:	  Wait, hold on a second. 
Whelk:	 RRAWWWWWR!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, what happened?
Patrick:	 Can't talk, Running! 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Squidward, please let us in!  Oh, heh heh.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs! Ravenous sea whelks are terrorizing Bikini Bottom! They kinda look like Gary, but not really, and they spit purple slime! And they're eating everyone! They tried to eat me and Patrick, but we ran and we got away!
Mr. Krabs:	 Ravenous?  That means hungry!  Krabby Patties! Get your Krabby Patties! Only 3.99 each!  That'll be 54.95.  Don't care for Krabby Patties, huh? Well, maybe there's something else on the menu you'd like!
Patrick:	  Spon... Spo... Spo...!
SpongeBob:	 Use your words, Patrick!  Squid... Squi... Squi... Squi...!
Squidward:	 Yep, that's one angry mama.
Mr. Krabs:	 Welcome to The Krusty Krab!   You seem to be a mollusk of deserting taste. Could I introduce you to a side of Kelp Fries?  Hey! I'm not on the menu!
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, it swallowed Mr. Krabs!
Squidward:	 And this affects me, how? 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, what are we going to do? 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Sandy! Please let us in!  Let us in!
Sandy:	  SpongeBob? Patrick?
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Please! Please, let us in!
Sandy:	 How can I be sure you're not whelks in disguise?
SpongeBob:	 We're not whelks! We're not whelks!
Sandy:	  What's your mom's maiden name?
SpongeBob:	 Eeh, BubbleBottom!
Sandy:	 Patrick, what's your first name?
Patrick:	 Uh, is this a trick question?
Sandy:	  You're in.  I think I have the answer! Now, do ya want the regular answer, or the ACTION PACKED answer?!
SpongeBob:	 Uh, action packed, please?
Sandy:	 Yes!  I need a sample of their slime! If I can analyze it, I might be deduce the cause of their behavior! And maybe we can stop them!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Hmmmmm.
Sandy:	  Oh, no!
Sandy:	 Come on, guys! Follow me! 
SpongeBob:	 Well, I guess this is end, Patrick!
Patrick:	 You guys go, I'll hold them off.  And if I failed, at least my sacrifice will be delayable!
SpongeBob:	 I can't let you do that, Patrick! I'll be the one to delay my life!
Patrick:	 Okay, you go!
Sandy:	 No, I'll go! The whelks don't seem to be after land critters! 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, look!
Both:	 The Krusty Krab!
SpongeBob:	 The gang's all here!
Squidward:	 We're closed. Come back tomorrow.
Sandy:	  Hey, SpongeBob! Lend me your corneas for a second! You too, Patrick!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Oh, okay. 
Sandy:	  Well, golly! No wonder they're all grumpy! Them whelks are full of germs! They're sicker than a bull with the squirrel pox!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I know what to do! After all, I've had the suds! I just have to absorb the whelks' snot, and they'll return to normal! 
Mama Whelk:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Now, let's get the rest of you cleaned! 
Whelks:	 Meow. Meow. Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Aww, cute. Ahhh... Ahhh... Ahhhh... Chhoooooo!  Excuse me! 
Squidward:	 Gesundheit.
Mr. Krabs:	 You did it, boy!
Squidward:	  So, these things went crazy just because they had the sniffles? 
Patrick:	 It's in his eye! 
Squidward:	 Oh, so hilarious.
