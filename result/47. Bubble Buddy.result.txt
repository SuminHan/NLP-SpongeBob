Narrator:	 Every day is a holiday for SpongeBob, even if he has to make one up.
SpongeBob:	  Hey everybody! It's Leif Ericcson Day! Hinga-dinga-durgin! Ahoy, Patrick! It's Leif Ericcson Day! There's a note.
Patrick:	  SpongeBob, went to get more giant paper. Uhhhh...Patrick. P.S. Happy Leif Ericcson Day! Yingin-hinga- dinga!
SpongeBob:	 Aww... so much for that. Maybe Sandy will play with me.  Another note.
Sandy:	  SpongeBob, went south for the winter. Love, Sandy.
SpongeBob:	 I don't get it. The water's fine.  Hey Squidward! Want to play?
Squidward:	  No.
SpongeBob:	 Are you sure?
Squidward:	  Yes.
SpongeBob:	 Darn. I wish I had a buddy to play with. I know! I'll make one! Stick Buddy!  Nah...  Rock Buddy! Nope...  Sink Buddy! "[Sink Buddy drips a little water]" Almost...  I've got it!  Bubble Buddy!  This...is...great!  I can't wait for you to meet Squidward and Mr. Krabs.  Don't be shy, come on! 
Squidward:	 Please come again. When I'm not working. Next.
SpongeBob:	 Hi Squidward!
Squidward:	 How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway?
SpongeBob:	 I want you to meet my new friend, Bubble Buddy!
Squidward:	 This bubble is your friend?  Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I'm not hungry.
Squidward:	 Well, thanks for stopping by.
SpongeBob:	 Wait! You haven't taken Bubble Buddy's order yet!
Squidward:	 Why would I do that?
SpongeBob:	 He's hungry.
Squidward:	 He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here!
Mr. Krabs:	  What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here.  At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds.
Squidward:	 I'm not taking an order for a bubble.
Mr. Krabs:	 Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe.  Even if you quit. 
Squidward:	 May I take your order?
SpongeBob:	 Wait, Bubble Buddy. Let me decide for you.  Hmmm. Krabby Patty, Double Patty Patty, Krabby Junior Junior, Jumbo Small Patty, Junior Senior Sophomore Patty, Quarter Ouncer Double Pounder...ohh, it's all so good! He'll just take one of everything. 
Mr. Krabs:	 One of everything?! Whoopee!  I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table. 
SpongeBob:	 Bubble Buddy's thirsty.
Squidward:	 How about a glass of our finest shampoo? 
SpongeBob:	 Sounds great! 
Squidward:	 Here's your hair care product, sir.
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, Bubble Buddy likes bendy straws.  Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?
Squidward:	 Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	  Think of the customer.
Squidward:	  Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy.
SpongeBob:	 Oh no, Squidward, wait! There's cheese on these patties!
Squidward:	 And?
SpongeBob:	 Bubble Buddy's lactose-intolerant, he can't eat cheese! What should we do?
Squidward:	 We? How about you take these patties and sho...
Mr. Krabs:	 Mr. Squidward! 
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch.
Squidward:	 What, is he allergic to bread, too?
SpongeBob:	 Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward...
Squidward:	 Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style!  And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask.
SpongeBob:	 That was delicious! Money's on the table, Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs:	 So long, boys! You see Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day.
Squidward:	 Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab. 
Mr. Krabs:	 What's this?
Squidward:	 Bubble money.  At least he left a tip! 
SpongeBob:	 Here we are buddy, Goo Lagoon. There are lots of ways to have fun here. 
Scooter:	 Dudes, bury me! 
SpongeBob:	 See what I mean?
Scooter:	  All right!
SpongeBob:	 Bubble Buddy, you dig him out while I get us some cotton candy.
Scooter:	 Don't just stand there dude, the tide's coming in.  Dude?
SpongeBob:	  My friend's in there.
Harold:	 Congratulations.
SpongeBob:	  Woo! Shake it! Shake it! Yeah! Shake that bubble butt! Yeah! 
Pearl:	 It's the world-famous surf punk, Grubby Grouper!
Grubby Grouper:	 Later, groupies!  Grubby's got to go catch some gnarly pounders. Ahoo!
Pearl:	  Oh, I'll never wash this flipper again. 
SpongeBob:	 Hey Pearl! Shake hands with Bubble Buddy!  It's his first time on his own.
Harold:	 Once again, congratulations. 
Man:	 Popcorn! Peanuts!
Lou:	  Ice cold drinks!
Harold:	  Two hours is long enough! That's it! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey Bubble Buddy, you're finished! 
Francis:	 He kept us waiting for a bubble?
Larry:	 That's nothing! He called us fat! 
Pearl:	  He washed my flipper!
Mr. Krabs:	  He owes me money!
Squidward:	  He made me provide excellent service!
Scooter:	  Dudes! He made me experience high tide! 
Tom:	 He poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses!
Protesters:	 He did?
Tom:	 No... But are we going to wait around until he does?
Mr. Krabs:	 I say we tip something over! 
Lifeguard:	 Hey, hey, hey! 
Protester:	 Now what?
Protesters:	 Get the lifeguard! 
Squidward:	 Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems!  Who's with me?
Protesters:	  Pop the bubble! 
SpongeBob:	  Hey everyone! Have you met my friend, Bubble Buddy?
Protesters:	 Yes...
SpongeBob:	 Hey, is this one of those sewing circles?
Protesters:	 No... 
SpongeBob:	 Would you mind not getting so close with those pins? Pointy objects make Bubble Buddy uncomfortable.
Larry:	 SpongeBob, that bubble's got to go.
SpongeBob:	 Oh no, he already took care of that, but thanks for your concern.
Pearl:	 No. "Go" as in... 
SpongeBob:	  Why?
Mr. Krabs:	 You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it!
SpongeBob:	 No! I won't let you!  Here we go! You'll never catch us now! Never! Ha! Never!  Never...
Squidward:	 Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble!
Protesters:	 Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble!
SpongeBob:	 No! You can't! He's not just a bubble, he's a Bubble Buddy! He's my friend and I love him! Haven't you ever had a very special friend?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, Nickel Buddy, I'll never spend you!
Sheldon:	 Funny Muffler...
Larry:	 Jerky Pal...
Harold:	 Boo-boo Keys...
Man:	 Snake Eyes...  We love you! 
SpongeBob:	 So, what do you say?
Protesters:	  Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! Pop the bubble! 
Squidward:	 Let's get this over with so I can go home and play my clarinet!
SpongeBob:	 Noo... 
Bubble Buddy:	 Whoa!  Hey, don't I get a say in this? I'll see you later, SpongeBob. Things are getting a little weird around here.
SpongeBob:	 So long. 
Bubble Buddy:	 Happy Leif Ericcson Day!
Squidward:	 He's... alive?
SpongeBob:	 Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes!  Seems like only this morning that I held his bottle.  They blow up so fast. 
Squidward:	  Uh...hi?
