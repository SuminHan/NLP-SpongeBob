SpongeBob:	 Here are the colorful boats that travel the canals in Xochimilco.
Patrick:	 Uh, bless you.
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick, I said, "Xochimilco", not...  We learned that in Mexico, instead of Halloween, they celebrate d√≠a de los Muertos.
Patrick:	 This Halloween, I'm gonna dress up like Patrick.
SpongeBob:	 Uh, but, Patrick, you are Patrick.
Patrick:	 That's why they'll never know its me.  It's brilliant!
