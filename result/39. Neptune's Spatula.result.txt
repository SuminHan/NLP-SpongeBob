SpongeBob:	 Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula! 
Patrick:	 Hey SpongeBob, look what it says here.  Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease but all have failed.
Larry:	 
SpongeBob:	 Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 ...the golden spatula. Wow!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula!  Okay, I'm ready! 
Miss Shell:	 Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is? 
Patrick:	 Uhh!
SpongeBob:	 Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way.  Uh-oh.
Miss Shell:	  Holy smokes! 
Patrick:	 Rude. Hey, the light changed.
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, Patrick...
Patrick:	  Hold on, almost there. 
King Neptune:	 Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.
King Neptune:	 A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge.  Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny!  Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook.  No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no...  Ah! 
SpongeBob:	 But, but...
King Neptune:	 A purveyor of foods.  Yes, you must be my new fry cook.
Hot Dog Vendor:	 Uhh, sorry, King Neptune. I don't make them. I just sell them.
King Neptune:	 Then who pulled out the spatula?
Hot Dog Vendor:	  Uh, he did. 
King Neptune:	  It is even funnier a second time!  You there, crustacean!
Larry:	 Who, me?
King Neptune:	 You have the physique of Atlas!
Larry:	  Thanks, I work out.
King Neptune:	  Make poses with me!
Larry:	 Okay!
Both:	  Body slam! 
King Neptune:	 You pulled the spatula from the grease!
Larry:	 Nope, that was SpongeBob.
King Neptune:	 This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook?  Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know how to cook a burger to suit a royal palate!  What? Am I expected to believe that this creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof?  Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.
SpongeBob:	 Like?
King Neptune:	 The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed.
SpongeBob:	 Actually, I've got two. 
King Neptune:	  Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear.  No, blue.  Uh, The royal fry cook's wallet contains...  His big toes are...  Uhh, he has six...
Patrick:	  He is the new royal fry cook and you...
King Neptune:	  Silence! 
Patrick:	 Is it hot in here or what? 
SpongeBob:	  Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!
King Neptune:	  So, little one, you think you have what it takes to become my royal fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!
Patrick:	   Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any...  Ouch.
King Neptune:	 Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.
Patrick:	  Only two? What are two challenges to someone like SpongeBob? 
King Neptune:	 Three challenges!
Patrick:	 Three?   Three challenges is nothing. Might as well make it 500 challenges! 
King Neptune:	 Enough! 
Patrick:	 He'll settle for one.
King Neptune:	 There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!
SpongeBob:	 I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.
King Neptune:	 Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him. 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!  SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!
SpongeBob:	 How you feeling?
Patrick:	 Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?
King Neptune:	 And now, see the fate that may lie ahead.  For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great.  Behold!  Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold!  My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!
Patrick:	 Hey, that sounds pretty good.
King Neptune:	 But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?
SpongeBob:	 I'm ready.
King Neptune:	 Very well then. To the Poseidome! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off!  All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.
SpongeBob:	  May the best man win.
Mr. Krabs:	 Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking!  Don't worry lad, I have total confidence in you.  Put it all on Neptune!
SpongeBob:	 I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.
Patrick:	 Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: "Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds." Well, just look at me now.  Go get 'em, tiger! 
SpongeBob:	  Once upon a time...
SpongeBob:	 Perfect!
King Neptune:	 I win!  Loser!  Free patties for everyone!  Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious!  Ooh.
Audience:	  You can eat it all, come one! Chew it! Why don't you eat it? Try it! Eat it! Eat it!
King Neptune:	  Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better?  Give me that!  Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time! 
SpongeBob:	 So, uhh, what do you think?
King Neptune:	 Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win. 
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 Yeah!  We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis! 
SpongeBob:	 What's so funny?
King Neptune:	 You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?
SpongeBob:	 You mean, Patrick can't come?
King Neptune:	  No, of course not.
SpongeBob:	 And my friends?
King Neptune:	 Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.
Patrick:	  It was nice knowing you, buddy!
SpongeBob:	  I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you too.
Mr. Krabs:	 I lost me bet!
King Neptune:	 Come SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart...  to Atlantis!
SpongeBob:	 I... I...  I don't wanna go!
King Neptune:	 It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it!  Maybe we do have a problem.
SpongeBob:	  Wait, Neptune! I have another idea! 
Patrick:	 Good morning, Krusty Krew.
SpongeBob:	 Hi, Patrick. What'll you have?  Can you excuse me?
King Neptune:	 The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thy own wrath, stove!  Haha!
SpongeBob:	 What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?
King Neptune:	  Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic.
