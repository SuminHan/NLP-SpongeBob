Patrick:	 There, there, SpongeBob. No need to cry.
SpongeBob:	  Yes, there is, Patrick. Sandy's been gone for two whole days.
Patrick:	 Two whole days?! 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, why'd she have to go to that science convention in Tejas?!
Patrick:	 Tejas! 
SpongeBob:	  She won't be back for one more hour, 26 minutes and 47 seconds.
Patrick:	 Oh, 47 seconds!  I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles,  the way she plays clarinet, her massive nose. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, that's Squidward.  He's not gone, he's right here. 
Squidward:	  No, I'm not. 
SpongeBob:	 I sure do miss that squirrel.  Her karate chopping,  that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth?  After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her.
Patrick:	 Is Sandy the one I call Mom?
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome! 
Patrick:	 Wa-hey! 
SpongeBob:	 Ah.  Huh?  We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be about...  ...Whoo, right now.  Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya.
Nat Peterson:	  No!  No one wants to hear you sing!
Sandy:	 Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no-singing policy. 
SpongeBob:	 That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy.  First, cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then...
Sandy:	  Wow, guys. You two, uh...  Really know how to, uh..  Throw a party.
SpongeBob:	 I knew it! You have been itching to see us.
Sandy:	 Well, something's making my skin crawl.
SpongeBob:	 Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide.  Patrick and I made this cake especially for your return. 
Patrick:	 This is gonna taste so good again.
SpongeBob:	 Dig in, Sandy.  Uh...
Sandy:	 Looks... Tasty, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	  Are you okay, Sandy?
Sandy:	 I'm fine! My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air. 
SpongeBob:	 Uh.. Hey, Sandy. Sandy.  Surprise!  Patrick and I chipped in and got ya' a little somethin' somethin'.
Sandy:	 Aww, guys, you shouldn't have.  A new itch board? I mean, a new snowboard? Boy, I sure can't wait to scratch this down chafe mountain.
SpongeBob:	 Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?
Sandy:	 Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat.
SpongeBob:	 Uh, you're welcome, Sandy. Hey, uh, are you still up for some karate chops?
Sandy:	  Rashy sore. I mean, sure.
SpongeBob:	  Ya ready?  And how 'bout now? You ready?
Sandy:	  Creepin' critters, feels like somethin's bitin' me.  I've got a flea? Well, I ain't gonna take that without a fight.  Hi...yah!  I'll get ya.  SpongeBob, my suitcase. Hurry.  I'm ashamed to say this, SpongeBob, but while I was in Texas, I seem to have picked up a flea. 
SpongeBob:	 What's a flea?
Sandy:	 A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers. But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'. 
SpongeBob:	  He tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad!  Ow!  He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?
Sandy:	 No, but you can use this one right quick. 
Patrick:	 Ow! Ah, Ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah.  Connect the dots.  I drawed a horsey.  Ouch! Why does this flea keep biting me?
Sandy:	 'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites you, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition.
Patrick:	 I've been bit by a vampire flea!  No!  I'm gonna turn into a vampire now!  It's already happening! Ah, ah! 
Sandy:	 Patrick  there ain't no such thing as vampires.
Patrick:	  Augh! Doesn't matter!  Oh, this itch is killing me. Yagh! 
Sandy:	 Aah! Gimmie that!  Phew! 
SpongeBob:	 Nyahh! Oh! Sandy, please, Help me, 
Sandy:	  I need this.
SpongeBob:	 I need it more! 
Patrick:	 Eee! 
Sandy:	 Yah!  Enough! I will not take this anymore!  Whatcha gonna do now, punks?  Looky, it worked. Phew. I'm glad that's over.
SpongeBob:	 Um, is that what over looks like? 
Sandy:	 Tarnation! They're multiplyin' like mad!  Run!
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 Okay! 
Patrick:	 Wah!
SpongeBob:	 Whoa!
Sandy:	 Hey!  Y'all got the aim of a cross-eyed armadilla.  Run again!
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 Okay. 
SpongeBob:	 Aah!
Patrick:	 Mraah!
Sandy:	 Aah!
SpongeBob:	 Uh, thanks for having us, Sandy, but we gotta go.
Patrick:	 Yeah, good to see ya. 
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 Raah!  Help! Help! Help!
Squidward:	 Just ignore them, Squidward, and continue your power walk. Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.
Sandy:	 Back off! 
SpongeBob:	 Sandy! Oh, no! Are you okay? 
Sandy:	 Them varmints is tough. They're from Texas, phew!
Patrick:	 It's gonna be all right.  We will help you.  Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation! All you've brought us is fleas, and trouble and pain and itching and a rash. And pain and fleas and itching and... pain. So... much... pain. So much pain. And as for you.  If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess.
SpongeBob:	 Wait a minute. You had as much to do with this party as I did.
Patrick:	 You call this a party? I'm beginning to question  our friendship.
SpongeBob:	 Stop smudging my helmet!
Patrick:	 Oh, I've got half a mind, buddy.
Sandy:	  Would you two men stop yelling at each other?!  What does that prove?! If were gonna get out of this, we gotta work together.
Patrick:	 You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders.  Uh-huh. Good. Now, I'll get on top of you!  Ah...  Ahhh... Much better.  Whoa!
Sandy:	 I do not play games.  Quick! In the tree house. It's the only safe place left.  We should be protected here.  Hold on! 
SpongeBob:	 Is this how we will spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?
Sandy:	  SpongeBob! That's It. Water! 
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 Water! 
SpongeBob:	 It sure is good to have you back, Sandy!
