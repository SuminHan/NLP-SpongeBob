SpongeBob:	 May I help you, sir?
Customer:	 I'd like that table over by the window. 
SpongeBob:	 As soon as the present customers are done with it. They like to chew their food thoroughly.
Mary:	 97... 98... 99...
Old Man Jenkins:	 Don't rush me, woman!
Customer:	 Perhaps this will speed up the process. 
SpongeBob:	 How will that help them chew faster?
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, what's the problem?
SpongeBob:	 No problem, I was just telling this customer he needed to wait for his favorite table.
Customer:	 Five bucks if I get the table now. 
Mary:	 Ow, my hip.
Mr. Krabs:	 Enjoy your meal. Let me know if you need anything else.
SpongeBob:	 Why did you give him the table?
Mr. Krabs:	 You know what they say: "Money Talks."
SpongeBob:	 I didn't know money could talk. Did it tell you to kick those old people out?  What do you have against old people?
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't go goofy on me, boy. Money can't really talk. Only fish can talk.
SpongeBob:	 Wouldn't it be neat if money could talk?
Mr. Krabs:	  Yeah. Wait a minute...
Squidward:	 What's that music?
SpongeBob:	 I think Mr. Krabs is gonna sing.
Squidward:	 Oh, great.
Mr. Krabs:	 ♪If I could talk to money, how great my life would be. We'd tell each other secrets, all their friends would visit me. I'd bathe in filthy riches, which is clean enough for me. Oh, if you could tell me what you want, how happy we would be. We'd surely be the best of friends, we'd never disagree. There wouldn't be a downside, not one that I could see. If I could talk to money, come along, sing with me.♪
Squidward:	 Uh, no thanks, I got to go.
SpongeBob:	 I really have to pee.
Mr. Krabs:	 ♪If I could talk to money, and it could talk to me. We'd always be the best of friends, for all eternity.♪ 
Patrick:	  What did I miss?
Mr. Krabs:	 ♪Oh...♪  ♪If I could talk to money, how great my life...♪  Parlez vous Francais? Hable Español? Ou-yay eak-spay ig-pay atin-lay? Mm-hmm. Maybe this will make you talk. Talk! You're being too hard on the little guy. You can talk to me. I'm your friend.  I would give anything to talk to money. Anything!
Flying Dutchman:	 Anything?
Mr. Krabs:	 You?
Flying Dutchman:	 That's right. 'Tis I, the ominous Flying Dutchman. I'll grant your wish but it'll cost you.
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah, yeah, my immortal soul. I've heard that speech before. 
Flying Dutchman:	 Wha...? Well, uh, great. But be warned!
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah, yeah, skip the lecture. I want what's coming to me.
Flying Dutchman:	 Humph, you're no fun at all, you know that?
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, is that pixie dust?  Whew, that was a strange dream.
Nickel:	 You think that was a strange dream? I dreamt I was trapped in a prison made of peanut butter.
Mr. Krabs:	 Who said that?
Nickel:	 Down here.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, it's a nickel. What were you doing in my belly button, little fella?
Nickel:	 I got stuck in there during your last coin shower.  I don't want to talk about it.
Mr. Krabs:	  Do you have anything to say to me?
Dollar Bill:	 Yeah, when was the last time you brushed your teeth?
Mr. Krabs:	 It worked! I can talk to money. Oh...
Nickel:	 Please, don't start singing again. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't worry, darlings. Soon you'll be rejoined with all your friends. 
Mary:	 Oh, my, why don't you kiss me like that?
Old Man Jenkins:	 Don't start.
Squidward:	 That'll be five dollars. 
Five-Dollar Bill:	 Hey, dudes.
Money:	 Run, jump! Jump out! Jump out! 
Mr. Krabs:	  Good morning, my darlings.
Money:	 Good morning, Mr Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 You're coming home with me.
Money:	 Yay!
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, I did it. I can talk to money.  Go ahead, say hello.
SpongeBob:	 Hello... money.
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh, aren't they a riot? 
SpongeBob:	 I'm starting to worry about Mr Krabs.
Squidward:	 I'm worried he just left with my paycheck. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Now that we're alone, let's tell each other secrets.
One-Dollar:	 What kind of secrets are you talking about?
Dime:	 Yeah, we live in a safe.
Money:	 yeah!
Mr. Krabs:	 You have any friends you can invite over?
One-Dollar:	 Aren't we enough for you?
Dime:	 Yeah, what's wrong with us?
Money:	 Yeah!
Mr. Krabs:	 Nothing, nothing. You guys are great. I thought you guy might want some company, you know, to make you happy.
Money:	 Why don't you ask what would make us happy.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ok, so how can I make you happy?
Money:	 Spend us!
Mr. Krabs:	 What?
Dime:	 We're money. It's in our nature.
One-Dollar:	 I've been trapped in that safe for eight years. I always wanted to be spent on a fairy princess outfit.
Mr. Krabs:	 What? No way.
Ten-Dollar:	 I want to be spent on corn dogs.
Five-Dollar:	 I want to be spent on diapers.
Money:	 Yeah, yeah, me too.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, wait a minute. I am not spending you on corn dogs, diapers, or fairy princess outfits. 
Clerk:	 Did you find everything ok?
Mr. Krabs:	  Unfortunately.
Money:	 All right! 
SpongeBob:	 [he walks up wearing a blue-purple fairy princess outfit. He also eats a corn dog. Under his outfit he has a diaper] Mr. Krabs, lookin' good. 
Patrick:	 [he's dressed in a dark green princess outfit and also has on a diaper as he eats his corn dog] What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob:	 I don't know. He's acting kind of weird. 
Money:	  Spend us. Spend us.
Mr. Krabs:	 I can't spend all of you. And none of you want to be spent on stuff I want.
Money:	 Spend us.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ah, you're all shallow and self-absorbed. What did I ever see in you?
Money:	 Spend us.
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm not listening...
Money:	 Spend us.
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm not...  SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 [back in everyday clothes] Hi, Mr. Krabs. I just came by to make sure you weren't, you know, totally insane.
Mr. Krabs:	  Take this bag as far away as possible and bury it.  What have I done?  Give me that back. 
SpongeBob:	 Ok,glad you're not insane. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Dutchman, you cheated me. Take this horrible curse away!  I want a refund.
Flying Dutchman:	 All sales are final from the Flying Dutchman, especially for a selfish shellfish like yourself. Try saying that three times fast. Your soul's going into me fanny pack of despair.  Now pay up. Huh?  An I.O.U. ?
Mr. Krabs:	 Hehe, yeah, well, I sort of sold my soul already.
Flying Dutchman:	 What? To who?
Mr. Krabs:	 To those guys.
Monster:	 We were here first, pops.
Monster #2:	 We've all got a claim on Krabs's soul.
Monster:	 Get to the back of the line. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Now, now, I'm sure we can sort this out.
Flying Dutchman:	 You too, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 He was five bucks short on payday.
