Narrator:	 Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the delicious Krabby Patty and its super-secret recipe. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Attention, Krusty Krab crew! All hands report immediately!
SpongeBob:	  Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!
Squidward:	  What's all the yelling about?
Mr. Krabs:	 Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula. 
Plankton:	 Can I have the secret formula?
Mr. Krabs:	 No.
Plankton:	 Okay. 
Mr. Krabs:	  But he was persistent!
Plankton:	  Pretty please?
Mr. Krabs:	 Uh-uh. 
Mr. Krabs:	 He used disguises!  Super science!  Civil disobedience!  And I always came out on top!
Squidward:	  Fascinating.
Mr. Krabs:	 But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open!  You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.
Robot:	  What a quaint restaurant. I think I will sample their wares.
SpongeBob:	 Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?
SpongeBob:	 With pleasure, sir!
Mr. Krabs:	  I'll take this one.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I help you?
Robot:	 Yes please. I'd like an order of chili coral bits.
Mr. Krabs:	  You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?
Robot:	 No thank you.  Will this cover it?
Mr. Krabs:	 Uh, sure.  Here you go.
Robot:	  Good day.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good. 
Plankton:	 AH-HAH!
Mr. Krabs:	 Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!
Plankton:	 That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!
Mr. Krabs:	 Or what?
Plankton:	 ...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well then, allow me to suggest your next move. 
Plankton:	 Curse you,  Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! 
Mr. Krabs:	  And now for the chaser! 
Plankton:	 You just wait, Krabs! Next time I'll... ah, who am I kidding? At least I can go home to a wife who understands. 
Karen:	 So? Tell me what happened.
Plankton:	 I don't want to talk about it.
Karen:	 Talking will make you feel better.
Plankton:	 Leave me alone.
Karen:	 That's your problem. You never let anyone in. Plankton the rock, Plankton the loner...
Plankton:	 And she's off, ladies and gentlemen.
Karen:	 ...and that's why everything you try ends up like this...  and like this...  and more recently, like this. 
Plankton:	  I'm a failure!
Karen:	 It's not that bad! You just require a little help. Maybe some henchmen...
Plankton:	 Henchmen?
Karen:	 Yes, what you need to do is surround yourself with muscular tough guys who will do whatever you say.
Plankton:	 I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language!  Felicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles! Who will join me!?
Plankton:	 I don't get it. No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me.
Karen:	 Oh, come on. I think you're overreacting.  Sorry.
Plankton:	 That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea.  The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny!  Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand!  But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds!  They're here! Welcome, brethren! 
Clem:	  Hey, look everybody! It's cousin Plankton!
All:	 Yee-haw!
Plankton:	 I've been away from home longer than I thought. 
Clem:	  Well, howdy, cousin! 
Plankton:	 Uh...
Clem:	 It's me, Clem. O' course, you remember Zeke, Rufus, Jeke, Billy Bob, Billy Jim, Billy Billy Bo Willy Banana Fana Fo Filly, Doug, Enos... 
Plankton:	 Alright! I get it! I mean, uh, come inside. Make yourself at home.  I'd like you to meet my computer wife, Karen.
Clem:	  Golly, she sure is purdy, Sheldon.
Karen:	 Sheldon?!
Plankton:	  Yes, that's my first name. 
Karen:	 Sheldon? 
Plankton:	  Will you please-!
Karen:	  Sorry!
Plankton:	 All right, as I was saying...  Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name.
Karen:	  Okay, okay. I'm done. No more.
Plankton:	 Good. Ahem, to continue.  Only you can bring honor...  ...and dignity...  ...back to the Plankton name.  For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for...  Aha!  Okay, that's enough!  Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula. What do you think?
Family Member 1:	 But what's in it for us? 
Plankton:	 Well, what do you want?
Family Member 2:	 Gawrsh. Can I get a new string for my banjo? 
Family Member 3:	 And another boot to match this'n? 
Family Member 4:	  And some more memory for my laptop!
Clem:	 And what about root beer?
All:	 Root beer?!
Plankton:	 Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink!  Victory, thy name is Plankton! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, Mr. Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours. Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for...
Plankton:	  Attention Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking.
Mr. Krabs:	 What?! 
Plankton:	  I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Ah, you and what army, bug?
Plankton:	 What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs:	 You planted grass?
Plankton:	 GRASS?!? 
Mr. Krabs:	 Uh-oh.  You'll never get away with it, Plankton. 
Plankton:	 You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination. 
Plankton:	 Silence!  I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys?  That's it, a little to the left...
Mr. Krabs:	 Curse you Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear! 
Plankton:	 Hot dog!  Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine!  Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!
Family:	  Ahem.
Plankton:	 Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula.
Plankton:	 Begging won't help.
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes.
Plankton:	 Eye.
Mr. Krabs:	 Eye.
Plankton:	 I don't care. Drum roll please!  Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good.  The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!
Mr. Krabs:	 Plankton! Wait!
Plankton:	  ...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm warning ya...!
Plankton:	  ...A cup of love...!
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't do it!
Plankton:	 ...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...!  ...Plankton?! 
Mr. Krabs:	 I warned ya.
Plankton:	 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey. Why ain't you running?
Clem:	 Well, I can't read.
Mr. Krabs:	 Get out of here! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey guys. Did I miss anything? 
Squidward:	 Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs:	 Of course not!  And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out. 
Squidward:	 Let me guess. It's at home, under your mattress.
Mr. Krabs:	  Curse you, Squidward!
