Narrator:	 Ah, observe the majesty of the mighty iceberg.  This frozen giant, normally found floating in polar regions, can sometimes  stray into warmer waters, causing dramatic changes in climate  for tropical, undersea life.
Johnny Elaine:	 Yes, it seems Old Man Winter paid us a visit late last night, and he brought with him not a pillow or a sheet,  but a blanket... a blanket of snow!  Yes, from Jellyfish Fields...  to residential abodes...  to bustling downtown...  it's nothing but the white stuff.
SpongeBob:	 Whoopee!
Johnny Elaine:	 And local residents are taking notice! 
Fred:	 Hey!
Plankton:	  What's this? Drops of rain frozen into ice crystals? I shall harness their energy and rule the world!  Ahh... oh, stop! I wish to rule you! 
Patrick:	 Snow angel!  Oh...  Hey!  Thanks a lot, SpongeBob! While you were just standing there whistling, someone threw a snowball at me!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, really, Patrick?  Did the snowball look like this? 
Patrick:	 Yeah.  This is serious, SpongeBob. Someone's after me. I think I better leave town.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, I threw it. We're having a snowball fight. Don't you get it?
Patrick:	 Snowball fight? I want to play! I want to play!
SpongeBob:	 Well, first, you have to make a snowball.
Patrick:	 Oh, yeah. A snowball.  Oh, this is gonna be great!  Huh?  Wha...?  Aw...! SpongeBob, could you help me make a snowball?
SpongeBob:	 Sure, pal. 
Patrick:	 Thanks, buddy. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick! How could you?
Patrick:	 It's a snowball fight, remember?
SpongeBob:	 Oh yeah. 
Squidward:	 Ah, yes. Warm fire, cozy slippers, and a piping hot cup of tea with a lemon wedge.  Why do I even bother?  Would you two please keep it down?!
SpongeBob:	 Squidward! You're just in time to enlist in my army! Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace!
Patrick:	 That's me!
SpongeBob:	 I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private!
Squidward:	 Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity. You and General Nonsense over there will have to fight without me.  Got 'em Both.  Grrrrrrrr! 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, you fool! This was over before it started! I will now consider your unconditional surren-...  ...-der.  So that's how he wants it to go down. 
Patrick:	 Huh?  Ha! You missed me! 
SpongeBob:	 Score one for the boys back home! 
Squidward:	 Yes? Oh, Patrick.  What an unpleasant surprise. Oh, boy, nothing like a game of charades. 
Patrick:	  I was trying to tell you that I was choking on snow, but the snow melted and turned into water, and I drank all the water, now I'm better.
Squidward:	 Fascinating.  Now, where was I?  What?
Patrick:	  Can I use your bathroom?
Squidward:	 Patrick, go use your own bathroom.
Patrick:	 I don't think I can make it! Please?
Squidward:	 No.
Patrick:	 Please?
Squidward:	 No.
Patrick:	 Please?
Squidward:	 No.
Patrick:	 PLEASE!
Squidward:	 Okay, make it quick.
Patrick:	  That's okay. 
SpongeBob:	 Aha! Aiding the enemy! I've caught you red-handed, Squidward!
Squidward:	 Look, SpongeBob, I was just...  SpongeBob! Oh... 
Patrick:	 Yay! Squidward's on my side!
Squidward:	 I most certainly am not!
SpongeBob:	 Then that means he's on my side!
Squidward:	 No, SpongeBob, I'm not on your side either. I'm on nobody's side. Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level.  If you two want to knock each other's brains out with snowballs, kindly leave me out of it. 
Patrick:	 Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!
SpongeBob:	 I'm ready!
Squidward:	 Hmm... 
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Patrick, it's out.
Squidward:	  Now there's something I'd actually like to see!  Nothing wrong with getting a front-row seat, I suppose.  Ahh. What's this?  Wha... I... no!  What are you doing? You're supposed to be knocking each other's brains out!
SpongeBob:	 We signed a peace treaty, Squidward.  You were right, fighting is for children.
Squidward:	 No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty!  There! Let the war continue!
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty. That was a copy of the peace treaty.
Squidward:	 Look, you two are giving up too easily. Now, Patrick, pretend I'm SpongeBob.
Patrick:	 And who am I?
Squidward:	 You're Patrick.
SpongeBob:	 Can I be Mr. Krabs?
Squidward:	 No! Wait, why?
SpongeBob:	 He's a good leader.
Squidward:	 Would you butt out?!
Patrick:	 Hey, you can't talk to Mr. Krabs like that, Squidward!
Squidward:	 I'm SpongeBob! You're Patrick!  Now, what are you going to do?  Patrick, why didn't you hit SpongeBob?
Patrick:	 You said  were SpongeBob, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	  Argh! It's true, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work! 
Squidward:	  Oh, boy. All right, I can see where this is going. Let's just say for all intents and purposes that I, Squidward, am now part in this war. Now...
SpongeBob:	 If you're in this war, then where's your fort?
Squidward:	 I don't have one, okay? Now...
Patrick:	 You got to have a fort, Squidward.
SpongeBob:	 Forts win wars, Squidward.
Squidward:	  Okay, fine? You want a fort?  There. There's your fort! Now...
Patrick:	 That fort's too small, Squidward.
Squidward:	 It's okay, Patrick. It's just a demonstration. Now...
SpongeBob:	 He's right, Squidward. That thing would never protect you. It's downright puny.
Squidward:	 Trust me, it's fine. 
SpongeBob:	 See, it is too small.
Squidward:	 Not if I crouch down. I mean, you didn't even give me a chance to crouch down.  See? Down here, I am perfectly... 
SpongeBob:	 Exposed.
Squidward:	 Would you two please...  ...stop throwing...  ...snowballs?! 
SpongeBob:	  Squidward returned fire!
Patrick:	 Then it's war!
Squidward:	 No-no... no, wait, wait, wait!  I was just giving a demonstration!  All right, that's it! You guys asked for it!  I got him! Ha! I got him!  In your face, SpongeBob!  This was actually kind of... exciting! Why... I've never felt so alive!
Patrick:	  He got you good, SpongeBob!  Take cover! 
Squidward:	  Take that... I got you... Yeah... oh, I got you... oh, take that... Whoa, I got you that time... Oh yeah...  Incoming! 
Patrick:	 Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Patrick?
Patrick:	 I think Squidward's taking this really seriously.  That last one had his clarinet in it.
SpongeBob:	 Hmm... looks like it's time for Plan B. 
Squidward:	 What's going on? The snowballs have stopped falling. I better take advantage of this momentary cease-fire.  What? My left flank is exposed? That bloated starfish is gonna run right through me!  I'll just fix that right now.  Wait, that makes my north wall a weak spot! Here we go! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh! But if they attack from the rear, I'm a goner!  There... Ha-ha!  But what about the possibility of an aerial attack!  I guess that ought to do it!  Fort Squidward is now all but impenetrable!  Now, where are those fools?  Ha! The first shot has been fired!  Take this, Patrick!  Taste my frozen fury!  Victory is mine!  Whee! Ha-ha! Well, I got you now! 
SpongeBob:	 Did you hear something, Patrick?
Patrick:	 Nope.
Man on TV:	 Get out the snowshoes and the shovels.
