Squidward:	 Wow. Squidward, this is the best souffl√© you have ever created. Congratulations, chef! 
SpongeBob Bubble:	 Hi, Patrick.
Patrick Bubble:	 Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood.
Squidward Bubble:	  Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know.
Patrick Bubble:	 Do you really think that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	  Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. 
Patrick Bubble:	 Yeah? Well, I think you're ugly.  Yellow is ugly! 
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, what are you talking about?
Squidward Bubble:	  SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you.  You give bottom dwellers a bad name.
Squidward Bubble:	  If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!
Squidward Bubble:	  Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop... as some newspaper!
Patrick:	  Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
SpongeBob:	  Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!
Patrick:	 Right, you're a turkey!
SpongeBob:	 What's that? 
Patrick:	 It's what you are!
SpongeBob:	 Well, you're a bigger one!
Patrick:	 Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
SpongeBob:	 What?
Patrick:	 You are!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, yeah? Well it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway!  Aww, tartar sauce! 
Squidward:	  
Patrick:	 Wow, Squidward, you're choking!  Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well.  I win!
Squidward:	 Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Patrick:	 I did?
Squidward:	 Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend! 
Patrick:	 Friend?  Friend...
Squidward:	  Yeah, Patrick, we're friends...  just friends. 
Patrick:	 So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend? 
Squidward:	 Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Patrick:	 Clarinet? I love music!
SpongeBob:	 Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary?  Gary? 
Squidward:	 Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Patrick:	  Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! 
SpongeBob:	 Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat!  Uhh...  The gang's all here...  Ohhh!
Squidward:	 Ow! My back! I threw out my back!
SpongeBob:	  Oh, boy, now's my chance! 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
SpongeBob:	  Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!
Squidward:	 No, no, no, get away from me!
SpongeBob:	 Hang on! I'll save you! 
Squidward:	  No, no! Get away from me! No, no!
SpongeBob:	  Hold on!
Squidward:	 No, no! Get away!  Oh! I'm ruined! I'm... I'm... I'm... I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You're a real friend! 
SpongeBob:	 ...

SpongeBob:	  Squidward...
Patrick:	  Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob.  Oh!
SpongeBob:	  And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer!  Umm, I can fix this. 
Squidward:	 Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh! 
SpongeBob:	 ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
Squidward:	 Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself. 
Patrick:	 Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya. 
Squidward:	 Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on!
