SpongeBob:	  Another order? Ok! Get ready Spaty! Time to grill up one more golden-piping hot Krabby Patt-WHA? Double dipped milkshake? Gee! I haven't made one of those in awhile!  Order up!  One Double Dipped Milkshake!  WAIT!!! I almost forgot!  Cherry on top! There you are sir! A Perfect Double Dipped Milkshake! Enjoy!
Harold:	 Well! It looks delightful!  This thing's frozen!  BARNACLES! How am I supposed to drink this!?  GAH!  This shake is disgusting!  Why you probably don't even have a license to milkshake!
SpongeBob:	 A license to milkshake? Well of course I do silly!  And it doesn't expire until......SEVEN YEARS AGO!?
Harold:	 Your milkshake license expired seven years ago!? OUTRAGEOUS! I DEMAND A REFUND!
Mr. Krabs:	  Hey now! Let's not say things we might regret later! Tell you what,  you come back tomorrow and SpongeBob will make you a proper milkshake.  Alright! See you tomorrow! 
SpongeBob:	 Where are we going, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm taking you back to school!
Mr. Krabs:	  There you are boy!  The Milkshake Academy! You know boy? Milkshaking technology and know-how is advanced since you were last a cadet!
SpongeBob:	 I shall do my best sir!
Cadet 1:	 Hey! Look! Up at the sea!  I don't think he's wearing a parachute!
Captain Frostymug:	 At ease, cadets!
SpongeBob:	  Mmmm!
Captain Frostymug:	 Welcome to the Milkshake Academy! I'm your instructor: Captain Frostymug! Let's not beat around the bush here boys! Your mamma's not here to wipe the whipped cream from your chinny-chin-chins! And I'm not here to help you with your bendy straws! My sole purpose is to transform you from mere guppies into cool, cold-drafted, chilled to the bone, ice cream blooded, licensed milkshake makin' guppies! But you must prove yourself worthy of this distinction!  Do you consire youself worthy? Cadet Squarepants?
SpongeBob:	 Yes sir! Worthy and ready!
Captain Frostymug:	 I see. Then this first test will be a breeze. What do you call  this?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, that's easy! It's an ice cream spatula! 
Captain Frostymug:	 That's enough! This, Cadet Squarepants, is your scooper. The most vital weapon in the milkshaker's arsenal! It's clear that most of you understand the fundamentals. Now it's time to see what you can do!  Cadets! Man your milky, milky stations!
SpongeBob:	  A few more bells and whistles than I'm used to. But I think I can work with this!  Oh dear! 
Captain Frostymug:	  FANTASTIC! Nice and creamy mouth feel!  SquarePants appears to be having problems...AGAIN! You! Please explain where he has gone wrong!
Cadet 2:	 Sir, yes sir! Sir! He is attempting to use the upper control panels to mix! Sir! Every cadet knows that these are telementry functions  And all of the controls are on the lower panel! Sir!
SpongeBob:	 Oh! That's right! Heh, how silly of me! Mr. Krabs' right.  Milkshaking has changed over the years. 
Captain Frostymug:	 Very good! But how does it taste?  Maybe we need to get back to basics...
Captain Frostymug:	 Listen up Cadet Squarepants! If you want to make a milkshake, you gotta know how it feels to be a shake!  Behold! The Shake Simluator! In you go! NOW! MARCH! HUT TWO THREE FOUR! HUT TWO THREE FOUR! HUT!  Teach this upstart a lesson, I'm setting it to "OBLiTERATE!" 
Cadet 2:	 But sir! No one's ever survived "OBLiTERATE!"
Captain Frostymug:	 SILENCE!!! He needs to learn cadet!
Captain Frostymug:	 Now, let's see how the boy turned out! 
SpongeBob:	 That was fun! Can I go again?
Captain Frostymug:	 Never, in my thirty years of milkshake instruction, have I had such an unteachable moron! CADETS! Do you have any ideas on how to teach Cadet SpongeBob?
Cadet 3:	 You'd be better off teaching a hunk of coral, sir! 
SpongeBob:	 I'll show you! I'll show you all I can make a milkshake! 
Captain Frostymug:	 When you first came to me just four short hours ago, you were nothing but a bunch of soda jerks! But now, you stand before me proud, mighty, milkshake makin' machines! It is with great pride I bestow upon you your milkshake operator license! Now, come up here and get them!  Well! I'm afraid there're aren't no more milkshake licenses. And do you know why?
SpongeBob:	 Um...the printer ran out of ink?
Captain Frostymug:	 NO YOU SIMPLETON! There're aren't anymore milkshake licenses because YOU don't get one! 
SpongeBob:	  Why not?
Captain Frostymug:	 Hmm...let me see!  Maybe it's got something to do with the fact that you couldn't even get past Step #1 of making a milkshake: Filling the glass with ice cream!
SpongeBob:	  NO Captain Frostymug! I can do it! Let me show you! I just know I can! 
Captain Frostymug:	 No, here let me show you!  You're suppose to raise the cup to the spinny thing!  Um, the...the spinny thing...
Customer:	 Boy! I can't wait to have one of your renowned shakes Sir Frostymug!
Young Frostymug:	 You tried the rest, now prepare for the best!  NOOOOO!
Captain Frostymug:	 NOOOO!!!!
SpongeBob:	 What's wrong Captain Frostymug?
Captain Frostymug:	 I haven't touched a milkshake machine in twenty years!  DEAR NEPTUNE'S THUNDERCLAP! I'm stuck in the blender! HELP!
SpongeBob:	 CAPTAIN FROSTYMUG!
Captain Frostymug:	   MY ARM!! 
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry sir! I'm coming!  Gotcha Captain!
Captain Frostymug:	 Save yourself boy! I'm a goner!
SpongeBob:	 NO! I'm not leaving you behind! 
Captain Frostymug:	 Thanks, SpongeBob!  You now, no one has ever treated me this old captain with much kindness. And in return, I'd like to tell you a little secret. All these years, I've been able to make milkshakes without machines because making milkshakes really comes from within! Does that make sense?
SpongeBob:	 Not at all...
SpongeBob:	 One milkshake, coming right up! 
Harold:	  You redeemed yourself SpongeBob! This is the BEST milkshake I'd ever had! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Where'd you learn those moves, SpongeBob?
Captain Frostymug:	  That would be from me! And in light of decent events, SpongeBob. I'd like to give you this 
SpongeBob:	 Gasp! My milkshake license! If only if were this easy to get a boating license!
