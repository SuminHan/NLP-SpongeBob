Patrick:	 Hey, that's Patrick-Man to you. 
SpongeBob:	 What're you doing out there?
Patrick:	 Something a non-hero civilian would never understand.  I'm about to unmask one of Bikini Bottom's biggest foes! Right here in the Krusty Krab. And I've intercepted his evil schemes! 
SpongeBob:	 You've intercepted a recipe for toasted coral bits. Don't you think you're going a little overboard with this Patrick-Man thing?
Patrick:	 Overboaaard??!! You call this overboard?! Away with Neptune's  Swiftness!  Villains and criminals, beware!  Patrick-Man is here! 
Mabel:	 Good gracious.

Patrick:	 Protecting Bikini Bottom from a scoundrel!
Mabel:	 Ohh dear!!
SpongeBob:	 Let her go, Patrick!
Patrick:	 No way! [ Hey! Where'd he come from?
SpongeBob:	  The Dirty Bubble?!
Patrick:	 The Dirty Bubble? I wanted to unmask Man Ray.
Dirty Bubble:	 Fools, you blew my cover! Now taste my wrath!
SpongeBob:	 What now, Patrick?
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, you're looking at a superhero. So naturally, I will rely on my superpowers,  and throw some stuff! 
Dirty Bubble:	  I wouldn't call that a total miss. 
Patrick:	 Take this, beast! 
SpongeBob:	 Wha, no, Patrick! 
Dirty Bubble:	 Haha, yummy sponge.
Mr. Krabs:	 You've disabled my employees and trashed me restaurant?! Think you might go for the Bubble now?
Patrick:	 I've got him right where I want him. For the Pit Punch! 
Dirty Bubble:	 Ha! Let's try that again, but this time, I attack! 
Patrick:	 Lunch! 
SpongeBob:	 Way to go, buddy! You're a hero! Uh, may I have your autograph?
Patrick:	 Why of course, young man. That's uh, SpongeBob with two 7s, right?
SpongeBob:	 What's your next exciting adventure, Patrick-Man?
Patrick:	 Actually,  it's Patrick to you.  I'm retiring. Having a job is too much work.
Mr. Krabs:	 Not so fast! I think I need you to use your superpowers one last time. 
Patrick:	 What's this?
