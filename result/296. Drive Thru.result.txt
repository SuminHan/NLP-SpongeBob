SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs, what 'cha doin?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh ahoy, SpongeBob! I'm was just using some old toothpaste I found to patch up this small hole in the wall.
Squidward:	 Good thing you didn't hire a professional to do that.
Mr. Krabs:	 And why is that, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward:	 Because then you'd only get to repair it once.
SpongeBob:	 So, what flavor is it?
Mr. Krabs:	 It-it-it's just a hole in the wall, boy. It doesn't have a flavor.
SpongeBob:	 No, I mean the toothpaste!
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh. Well I think it's... 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, look Mr. Krabs! That small hole in the wall just became a medium sized hole in the wall!
Squidward:	 Time to get out the dental floss. Ha. 
Boy 1:	 Thanks again for taking us to the Krusty Krab, dad.
Boy 2:	 Yeah, mom never brings us here.
Frank:	 Ha. Any time kids. What the?
SpongeBob:	 Careful now...
Frank:	 Hey, you guys put in a drive through!
Mr. Krabs:	  We did?
Frank:	 Great, I'll have three large Krabby Patties, Krabby Fries, a Krabby Cola, and 2 extra large orders of Krabby Rings.  Is this toothpaste?
Mr. Krabs:	  Boy, I don't know how I think think of this stuff, but I think I got a winner! We are putting in a drive through!
SpongeBob:	  A drive--- woah!
Squidward:	 Sounds like a lot of extra work to me.
Mr. Krabs:	 You mean for you.
Squidward:	  It'll cost you money.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh nonsense, we'll build it for free!
SpongeBob:	 Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ahoy, SpongeBob. What's with all the booty?
SpongeBob:	 I got this new microphone system which everybody hears them, The sign with a menu on it, and a colorful arrow from the Krusty Krab. It even lights up, see? 
Mr. Krabs:	 OK, but, I got something better. A menu made with napkins and tape, A microphone system made of tin cans, and this sign... I made it from an old noodle.
SpongeBob:	 I don't get it, Mr. Krabs. How is this stuff better than I bought?
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm sorry, what?
SpongeBob:	 How is this stuff better?
Mr. Krabs:	 Because it was...  Free!
Frankie Billy:	 I'll have one Krabby Patty with extra fries and a medium drink.
Squidward:	 Coming right up, sir. SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty, with extra fries and a medium drink.
SpongeBob:	 I'll have that ready for two shakes in a lamprey's tail! hehehehehe!  Oops.  There we go, good as new.  Thank you, come again.

Dale:	 Excuse me, I like to place an order. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Ahoy, Squidward.

Mr. Krabs:	  Problem solved!
SpongeBob:	 Squidward! Hi!
