SpongeBob:	 Oh it doesn't come with a toy.
Patrick:	 What? That's a rip off! I want my money back!
Mr. Krabs:	  Money back?!
Mr. Krabs:	  What's the problem here?
Patrick:	 My Kiddy meal didn't come with a toy!

SpongeBob:	 Oh, hi, Patrick. Have you met my new toy?
Patrick:	 Don't you mean "our" new toy?
SpongeBob:	 Our new toy?
Patrick:	 It came from the meal that we're "sharing."
SpongeBob:	 Sharing?
Patrick:	 Remember?  Sharing is the most wonderful feeling in the world, like dancing with a magical seahorse through an enchanted kelp garden  Remember those words, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 I didn't say that. But I guess we can share Patty Pal.  Now can I see it again Patrick? 
Patrick:	 I thought we were sharing it?
SpongeBob:	 When's my turn?

Sandy:	 Hi Patrick, SpongeBob.
Both:	 Hi Sandy.
Sandy:	 What in tarnation's going on with you two?
Patrick:	 SpongeBob won't let me play with my toy.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick won't share OUR toy.
Sandy:	 What you need is a mediator. Y'all bet to sit down and work this out. Now the main problem in an argument is a lack of communication. You can only resolve conflict when you understand each other.  So I want each of you to state what is most important to the each of you right now.
SpongeBob:	 Water?!
Patrick:	 Oh boy.
SpongeBob:	 That mediator lady make some good points.
Patrick:	 Most definitely.
SpongeBob:	 It takes understanding.
Patrick:	 Communication is key.
SpongeBob:	 It's my turn!
Patrick:	 No, it's mine!
SpongeBob:	 Mine!
Patrick:	 If I can't have it, no one can!
SpongeBob:	 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Mr. Krabs:	 Avast, there, laddies. What's all this ruckus about now?
SpongeBob:	 It's our Krabby Patty toy Mr. Krabs, and Patrick ate it, so I can't play with it.
Patrick:	 SpongeBob won't let me play with it.
SpongeBob:	 Only if you have it all night.
Patrick:	 I did not!
SpongeBob:	 Did too!
Patrick:	 Nuh-uh!
SpongeBob:	 Oh you, toy eater!
Patrick:	 Tattletale!
Mr. Krabs:	 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, settle down. All this brawling is over a toy? You two shouldn't let a little trinkle between youse two. You should be ashamed of yourselves. If I give you each of ya another toy, would that make you happy?
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Yes.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, you're in luck! You two so thrilled with a toy. I'm have entire case e'made. I've been selling my hotcakes. That'll be $13.50 each.
Patrick:	 This time it's on me. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, that's my money.
Patrick:	 Have you learned nothing about sharing?
