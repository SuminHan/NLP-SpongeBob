SpongeBob:	 This is how to live, isn't it my friend?
Patrick:	 You said it buddy.
Evelyn:	 He's amazing!
Frank:	 I'll say! 
Kids:	 Woah! 
Evelyn:	 Who is that guy?
Nazz:	 That's Larry the Lobster. He's like living large!
Nat:	 What's your secret Larry?
Larry:	 Well, you've gotta take risks.  Live on the edge. 
All:	 Ooh! 
Larry:	 And you can't... Uh... You can't...  And you can't live like these two. Just look at 'em. Spineless,  weak,  afraid of their own shadows.  Pathetic!
Nat:	 Larry, how can they redeem their worthless lives?
Larry:	 I'll tell you how: by living each day as if it were their last!
Patrick:	 How do we do that?
Larry:	 By living like me, Larry.
Patrick:	 But what's that have... 
Larry:	 By living, like Larry.
Both:	 Living, like Larry.
Larry:	 Living like Larry! 
Patrick:	 Living like Larry. Living like Larry.  This is bogus!
SpongeBob:	 What's that Pat?
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, these are the best years of our lives, and you want to waste them blowing bubbles? We should be living in the moment! We should be living like Lar...  This is it SpongeBob! This is where we redeem are miserable lives! It's time to start...  ...  Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob:	 I'm living like Larry! Whoo-hoo! 
Patrick:	 Where were you SpongeBob? That was awesome! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey Patrick, where you going?
Patrick:	 To live my friend! We are going to live!  This is going to be the best fun yet! 
SpongeBob:	 I don't know about this Patrick.
Patrick:	 You must defeat your reason, before you can start...  ...living like Larry!  Wo-hoo! SpongeBob, this is it! 
Music:	 Livin' Like Larry
SpongeBob:	 De dee do dee do livin' like Larry. Dee dee dee doo livin' like Larry. Deedeedeedee livin' like Larry. 
Patrick:	 Come on SpongeBob! What are you waiting for? Let's go! 
SpongeBob:	 Uh, Patrick, where are we going?
Patrick:	 Just you wait! it's the ultimate!  What do you think? And wait 'till you see the best part!  Hey you guys. 
SpongeBob:	 I don't know Patrick, this looks very danger... 
Patrick:	 Here's to living like Larry!
SpongeBob:	 Well, wait a minute Patrick, I think your missing the point. "Living like Larry" doesn't mean throwing caution to the wind, and risking everything on a stunt that will cost you your life.
Patrick:	 Don't you mean, cost us our lives SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 No Patrick, I mean your life. I'm not going.
Patrick:	 I see. And that's your final word on the subject?
SpongeBob:	 Mmm-hmm.
Patrick:	 I feel sorry for you. 
SpongeBob:	 I wonder how Patrick's doing with his "living like Larry" thing.
Patrick:	 SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!  You were right SpongeBob! I went too far! I went too far!
SpongeBob:	 Oh it's okay buddy, I think you learned your lesson. Hmm?
Patrick:	 Uh-uh.
Tough Guy 1:	 Don't make us come in there kid! 
SpongeBob:	 Now you just let me handle those guys out there.  Gentlemen, Gentlemen.
All:	 What the?
SpongeBob:	 I know that you might be angry at my friend for his shenanigans, but you are not the only victim. His reckless thrill chasing has made him a hollow shell of his former self. Just look  So let me assure you, his days of "living in the moment" are over. Can you not forgive him for what ever he did? 
Tough Guy 2:	 Sure pal. Sure. 
SpongeBob:	 By the way, what did he do that made you all so cranky? 
Tough Guy 2:	 He knocked over our motorcycles! 
SpongeBob:	 So scared! Adrenalin pumping!  Spine tingling! Endorphins rushing! I've never felt so alive! Oh, yeah baby, yeah! This is what Patrick was talking about! This is really living in the moment! Woo-yeah! This is life! Woo, woo, yeah, woo!  Now I am finally living like Larry! 
Patrick:	 Are you sure about this SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Oh come on Patrick, what happened to being in the moment?
Patrick:	 I don't know SpongeBob, this looks pretty dangerous.
SpongeBob:	  Yeah, yeah, you said it buddy! Now we're really living like Larry! 
Larry:	 Well, would you look at that. Now there's two guys who know how to live!
SpongeBob:	 Prepare for countdown!
Larry:	 I'm proud of them.  Wait a minute, with that angle of trajectory, they'll land right in...Rippers Reef! They'll be ripped to shreds!  Wait, don't do it! Stop!
SpongeBob:	 3-2-1 Lift off. 
Larry:	 Drat! 
SpongeBob:	 Whooooo!!! Whoohooooo!!! Whoowoowoo!!! 
Larry:	 Whoooooa!!!  Look, guys, my advice wasn't meant to be taken literally! I meant to live life to the fullest, not to maim yourselves! Look! 
Patrick:	 Uh oh!
Larry:	 AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!  AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! 
SpongeBob:	 What are you two lazy bones doing lying around? There's a really cool ramp down the hall, I've got room for two more. (Looks crazy in eyes) What would Larry do?
Larry:	  What would Larry do? I'll show you what Larry would do!  Come here! Come here I said! Hey!
