Patrick:	  No, no!  Yay! 
Nerd:	 Well, if only inaudible lad were here right now.
Patrick:	 Oh.  Nothing satisfies like a good story.
SpongeBob:	  Are ya ready to go, Patrick?
Patrick:	  Get back, I wasn't going to eat all of you!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, it's me!
Patrick:	 Sponge-- 
SpongeBob:	 Ew, what's this?
Patrick:	  Well, whatever it is, it's mine! Unless I don't want it!  SpongeBob, what do all these words say?
SpongeBob:	 It's an ad.  Dear Comic Book Reader.
Patrick:	 That's me!
SpongeBob:	  Have you ever thought about turning one of your poems into a hit song on the radio?
Patrick:	 I never thought about anything!
SpongeBob:	  Send in your poem and $100 and we'll make it a hit!  Can we go now? My arms are getting tired.
Patrick:	 I want to send in a poem, and everyone would love it, and I would be a star!
SpongeBob:	 You can't always trust ads in comic books. Those X-Ray specs I ordered couldn't see through people's skin at all!  Only their clothes! Plus, you don't have $100.  Patrick, could you get my wallet? 
Patrick:	 Hey, look.  I just found $100! It's a sign that I should make my hit record.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, that's my comic book money!
Patrick:	  It's a sign! A sign that fell from the back of your pants. I've learned to trust signs like that. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick. 
Comic Book Store Clerk:	 Hey, you going to pay for those comics? 
SpongeBob:	 No.  Ow! Can I have my arms back? 
Patrick:	 I wish not to be disturbed, SpongeBob, for I am about to erupt with a masterpiece. 
SpongeBob:	 Good luck.  Coming-- 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, could I borrow a pencil and some paper and a place to work? 
Patrick:	  SpongeBob! THIS PENCIL IS BROKEN! Why won't it make words?
SpongeBob:	 You have to think of the words yourself. 
Patrick:	 I think I wrote a poem once. 
Young Patrick:	 A poem, by Patrick Star. Roses are blue, violets are red, I have to go to the bathroom. 
Gym Teacher:	 How many times do I gotta tell ya, this is gym class! 
Patrick:	  Ohh, dodgeballs.
SpongeBob:	  Oh, Patrick!
Patrick:	  Don't hit me with a dodgeball! 
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Why would I hit you with a dodgeball?
Patrick:	 I've never told anyone this, I wrote a poem once.
SpongeBob:	  No!
Patrick:	 Wait! There's more. When I read it to the class, they pelted me with dodgeballs! Just because we were playing dodgeball!  Whyyyyyy?! 
SpongeBob:	  You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?
Patrick:	 I'm worried my poem's not gonna be any good and you're going to hit me with dodgeballs.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?
Gary:	  Meow.
Patrick:	 If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain.
SpongeBob:	 That's the spirit, Patrick! I'll open a window. 
Patrick:	  Come on, you stupid brain! work!  It's working! 
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, don't strain yourself. 
Squidward:	 Now, what's going on?  What is that horrible smell?  Is Patrick thinking again?
Patrick:	 I'm making art!
Squidward:	 Patrick, it smells like something crawled in your brain and died.
Patrick:	 That's the creative process at work!  Ready to go to the post office?  I need to mail in my masterpiece.
