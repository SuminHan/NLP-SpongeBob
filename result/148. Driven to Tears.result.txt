Narrator:	 It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob:	 I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?
Patrick:	 Right here, buddy.  Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards.  Mmm.
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick!
Patrick:	 Hey, learning tastes good.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, I needed those.
Patrick:	 Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.
SpongeBob:	 57 times.
Patrick:	 Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.
SpongeBob:	 I'm a winner?
Patrick:	 Who's a winner?
SpongeBob:	  I'm a winner.
Patrick:	 Who's a winner?
SpongeBob:	  I'm a winner.
Patrick:	 Who's a winner?!
SpongeBob:	 I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner! 
Narrator:	 One minute thirty seven seconds later... 
Patrick:	 How'd you do, winner?  Let's see that license.
SpongeBob:	 I didn't get a license, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Are they gonna mail it to you?
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.
Patrick:	 No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.
SpongeBob:	 Let's just go home, Patrick.
Patrick:	 We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.
SpongeBob:	  No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive. 
Patrick:	 Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick. No!
Mrs. Puff:	  Good morning.
Patrick:	 You're not the judge of me.
Mrs. Puff:	 Actually, I am. Let the testing begin! 
SpongeBob:	 I shouldn't have let him do it. What kind of friend am I?
Patrick:	 SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 I'm here for you, buddy.
Patrick:	 I passed my test!
SpongeBob:	 You got a perfect score?
Patrick:	 Yeah, I thought you said it was hard.
SpongeBob:	 Perfect score. 
Patrick:	 Come on, I'm gonna get my picture taken for my new license. 
Miss Shell:	 Stand behind the line, sir.
Patrick:	  How do I look?
SpongeBob:	  Like a winner.
Miss Shell:	 Ready?
Patrick:	 Ready. 
SpongeBob:	 Huh?
Fish:	 Congratulations, Mr. Star. You're the one millionth person to pass the test.
Patrick:	 Does that mean I get a free key chain?
Fish:	 Uhh, no.
Patrick:	 Oh.
Fish:	 You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.
Patrick:	 Yeah! All right!
Fish:	 Women will want you.  Men will want to be you.  You'll be the envy of your friends. 
Patrick:	 Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.
SpongeBob:	 I'm so happy for you...  Whoa!
Patrick:	 The horn works.  Whoo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.
Patrick:	 Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.
SpongeBob:	 Two millionth?
Patrick:	 Then you can get a free boat just like me.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, just like you.
Patrick:	 I try to serve as an inspiration to others.
SpongeBob:	 Can we go home now?  We've been driving around your house for hours.
Patrick:	 I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?
SpongeBob:	 Thanks for the ride, Patrick.
Patrick:	 No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick:	 I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep. 
SpongeBob:	 4:00?  Who could be at the door at this hou—  Now what is it, Patrick?
Patrick:	 You will never guess what happen to me today.
SpongeBob:	 You got your license.
Patrick:	 Yeah!  But that's not all.
SpongeBob:	 You got a new boat.
Patrick:	 Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life. 
SpongeBob:	  Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep. 
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat.  I'm so tired. 
Patrick:	 Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?
SpongeBob:	 Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work. 
Patrick:	 Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.
SpongeBob:	 Thanks for the ride.
Patrick:	 No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license. 
SpongeBob:	 That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.
SpongeBob:	 When did we get a drive-thru?
Mr. Krabs:	 I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.
SpongeBob:	 I used to have a dream.
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.
SpongeBob:	  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I— 
Patrick:	 The horn still works.  Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 What's with the helmet, Patrick?
Patrick:	 Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image. 
SpongeBob:	 Uh-huh. 
Patrick:	 Boy, driving is so easy.
SpongeBob:	 Oh?
Patrick:	 Do you want me to give you lessons?
SpongeBob:	  Oh, that would be great.
Patrick:	 Oh! 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick!
Patrick:	 Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.
Mr. SquarePants:	 Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you we're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours?
Patrick:	 What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.
Mrs. SquarePants:	 That's great, Patrick.
Patrick:	 SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.
Mrs. SquarePants:	 Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.
SpongeBob:	 Mom!
Patrick:	 Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.
SpongeBob:	 Hey. 
Mr. SquarePants:	 Even Patrick has a license. 
Patrick:	 Let's see what this baby can do. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.
Patrick:	 Yeah, yeah.
SpongeBob:	  40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car. 
Patrick:	 What? Where? Who?
SpongeBob:	 Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?
Officer:	 Umm... okay.  Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale. 
SpongeBob:	 Are you sure you don't want to run him in?  It's a red light, Patrick!  Patrick, you just ran 3 red lights!
Patrick:	 So?
SpongeBob:	 You're suppose to stop!
Patrick:	 I think the driving genius knows what he's doing!
SpongeBob:	  Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!
Patrick:	 They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?
SpongeBob:	 I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!
Patrick:	 How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!
SpongeBob:	 If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!
Patrick:	 I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face! 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this! 
Officer:	 Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force. 
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 It's the police!
Officer:	  Pull it over, litterbug!
Patrick:	 Litterbug?! No! 
Officer:	 Ooh, I got me a runner. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, what do you think you're doing?
Patrick:	 I don't know! I don't have a license anymore. 
Judge:	 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.
Patrick:	 So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.
SpongeBob:	 What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait!  Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.
Judge:	 Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days! 
Narrator:	 One debt to society later... 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick!
Patrick:	 SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob:	 I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever.  Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.
Patrick:	 Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.
SpongeBob:	 What?
Patrick:	 It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, then what do we do with this? 
Patrick:	 How's that?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah!
Patrick:	 Ready, buddy?
SpongeBob:	 Ready, pal.  Whoo! Whoo!
