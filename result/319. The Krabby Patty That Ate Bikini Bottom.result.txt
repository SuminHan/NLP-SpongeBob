Mr. Krabs:	 What better way to spend an afternoon than trolling the sea vent for spare change.  Whooh!  There's got to be a small fortune than discarded paperclips in there!  I knew this place looked familiar. [ What's this? Goodness, that must be Sandy's Treedome dwelling, and inside looks to be the largest soybean I have ever layed me eyestocks on. Now this bears getting a closer look.  Good afternoon, Miss Sandy.
Sandy:	 And good afternoon to you Mr. Krabs. What brings you out to this fine neck of the woods?
Mr. Krabs:	 Well uh, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and was wondering if you could see you in clear and grace me with a comprehensive tour of your homesweet treedome.  I hear the giant soybean is lovely this time of the year.
Sandy:	 Sure, lets get you fitted with a helmet.
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't bother yourself. As long as I keep me ole lungs moist, I can breath your fancy air all day long.
Sandy:	 Come on in then. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Seems so much bigger once your inside.
Sandy:	 That's what they all say. Did I already show you my single wheeled roller skate or my helicopter that is powered by coconut milk?
Mr. Krabs:	 Huh? Oh yeah, that sounds interesting Sandy, but uh actually...
Sandy:	  Or my artificial intelligence that comes in the form of a multi-colored cubeshaped puzzle. See it can solve itself. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Uh Sandy, actually I'm not interested in all of that.
Sandy:	 Okay, well was there something particular you wanted to see?
Mr. Krabs:	 Tell me about your giant soybean.
Sandy:	 This is the result of an experimental growth serum I develop. It could easily feed a lot of hungry people.
Mr. Krabs:	  Or a supply of entire rest---.
