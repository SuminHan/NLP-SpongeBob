SpongeBob:	 Hmmm, strange indeed...
Patrick:	 AAAAAAHHH!!!! My cuff links! They're missing! Oh, why? Why?

Squidward:	 
SpongeBob:	 Reporting to duty, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? Pearl? what are you doing here?

Pearl:	 I don't know. When I went to get my allowance this morning, he was gone.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs is missing?
Squidward:	 I'm missing my clarinet.
SpongeBob:	 ...and Gary's shell.
Patrick:	 Has anyone seen my cuff links?!
Sailor:	  So, you lost your cuff links, aye? They're probably in the Bikini Bottom Triangle.
SpongeBob:	 Bikini Bottom Triangle?
Sailor:	 That's right. First, an eerie fog blows in,  then, you can here the hypnotic song of the mermaids.  And then, your cuff links are gone. Never to return... 
SpongeBob:	 The triangle must've taken Mr. Krabs. We gotta find him!
Squidward:	 Maybe he's doing his morning dumpster dive for change.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, are you out here?
Squidward:	 Oh no, is that a mermaid song?
SpongeBob:	 No, just a thick eerie fog.
Squidward:	 Ohh no!!
SpongeBob:	 Squidward.
SpongeBob:	 Come on, Squidward, stop messing around. We've gotta find Mr. Kra- hey, gumballs! .
Squidward:	 OOOHHHH! This is the Bikini Bottom Triangle? Looks more like a dump.
SpongeBob:	 Come on, we've gotta find Mr. Krabs. The Krusty Krab needs him. Mr. Krabs?  Squidward, this is no time for seahorseplay!
Squidward:	 Oh, my neck.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs! Mr. Kraaaaaabbbbbsssss!
Squidward:	 Would you shut it already?!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Squidward, Mr. Krabs is gone. I can't take it much longer! Oh, it hurts so bad! I can't take it much longer! I hope he's not in too much pain...where ever he is.
Squidward:	 Oh, I think Mr. Krabs is doing just fine.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs! You've gotta get up. We gotta get out of here.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ohh, Okay, Tibor I think I'm good.
Tibor:	 Remember to drink plenty of fluids.
Mr. Krabs:	 Look, SpongeBob, you see all this stuff, including you and me, are brought here when the mermaids sing their beautiful song, the mermaids' song triggers this here contraption, to suck this pile like a vacuum. Dumpin' all the contents here on this island, that is how we ended up surrounded. With all this valuable and resellable stuff!  Oh, Yippee! Another shipment! Free stuff, here I- come?  Pretty neat, aye, boy? 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick!
Patrick:	 Have you found my cuff links?
SpongeBob:	 No.  Patrick, is that a Krabby Patty?
Patrick:	 Yep. Pearl doesn't make them as good as you do, though.
Mr. Krabs:	 Pearl?  Oh, my sweet little girl, all alone, with me cash register!
Pearl:	 Daddy!
Mr. Krabs:	 Pearl!!
Pearl:	 Get me out of this trash heap!
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh me little angel. Thank you mysterious signing mermaids.
Pearl:	 Enough with the hugging!
SpongeBob:	 That's it Mr. Krabs! I'll just find the mysterious singing mermaids and ask them how to get out of here!

Mr. Krabs:	 Why, thank you, Boy-o. I'm glad you- Wait a minute, I didn't make that Krabby Patty, and you didn't make that Krabby Patty, and those two couldn't have made it, so it must have been that rotten pipsqueak Plankton!

Mr. Krabs:	 Oh really? Well, I think you don't know who to talk to the ladies.
SpongeBob:	 Well, sir, I-
Mr. Krabs:	 Look, boy, I've got a way with the ladies, and I guarantee the old Krabs charm, will have them telling us exactly how to get out of here.  So there's really no way out of this place? I really need to get back to the Krusty Krab to stop my arch-nemesis from ruining my business.

All Mermaids:	 Ah, huh!
Mr. Krabs:	 Now, how do you propose we do that, huh? Wait, I know we just hit the magic reverse button on the giant vacuum cleaner.
SpongeBob:	 That's it sir! It's the mermaids!
Mr. Krabs:	 It sure is, what?
SpongeBob:	 The reverse switch is the mermaids, they just need to sing their song, backwards.
