SpongeBob:	 Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahh, what a beautiful day!  I wonder if Patrick's at home.
Patrick:	 Hiya SpongeBob!  Whatcha doin'?
SpongeBob:	 Goin' over to Sandy's place.  Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
Sandy:	 Don't lose your barnacles boys. Hi-yah!  There it is!
SpongeBob:	 What is it?
Sandy:	 Can't you see? It's Texas.
SpongeBob:	 Texas? What's a Texas? 
Sandy:	 Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.
SpongeBob:	 All right then. Let's make one of your tree dome.
Sandy:	 You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles, SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later. 
SpongeBob:	 Sandy? Hi-yah!
Sandy:	 Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now.
SpongeBob:	 Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy.  Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah! 
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, Sandy?  Surf's up Sandy!
Sandy:	 No, thanks. 
SpongeBob:	  Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing! 
SpongeBob:	 Look Sandy, we caught one!
Sandy:	 Listen, SpongeBob. Right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish.
SpongeBob:	  We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
Patrick:	 Fly away, little critter!
SpongeBob:	 Go on, go back to where you belong.  Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home!  Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?
Sandy:	 I ain't crying! My helmet just sprung a leak!
SpongeBob:	  Sandy...
Sandy:	  Oh, I guess I'm just feeling a little homesick.
SpongeBob:	 Homesick, huh?  Almost there.
Sandy:	 Heck gum it, SpongeBob, what is it?
SpongeBob:	 Da-ta-dah. 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Welcome home, Sandy!
SpongeBob:	 Sandy?
Sandy:	 Go away. 
SpongeBob:	 I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy?
Patrick:	 Maybe it's just a squirrel thing.. 
Sandy:	 ♪Wish I was back in Texas. The ocean's no place for a squirrel.♪  ♪Wish I was in Texas, prettiest place in the world oh no. I guess that deep in my heart, I'll always be a Texas girl. I wanna go hooooooooooooooome, home.♪ 
SpongeBob:	  Patrick do you hear that? 
Patrick:	 Arrrgh! Get them off me! Get them off me!
SpongeBob:	 Wait, Patrick, listen. It's Sandy.
Sandy:	 ♪I wanna wake up in Texas.♪  ♪I miss those wide open skies. I miss my 20 acres, barbecues and pecan pies, oh, why? When I'm so far from you Texas, all I can do is cry.♪  ♪I wanna go hoooommme.♪  ♪I wanna go home.♪ 
Patrick:	 Do you think she knows the Muffin Man song?
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, she sang that song from her heart. She really misses Texas.
Patrick:	 Well, let's get some Texas and bring it down here!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, we can't...that's it! Patrick, your genius is showing!
Patrick:	  Where?
SpongeBob:	 Everything looks perfect. We're going to get Sandy now.
Mr. Krabs:	  Well, hurry up lads! We can't squat like this forever!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Sandy's surprise is at the Krusty Krab!
Patrick:	 Wait until she sees the...
SpongeBob:	 Shh! Don't spoil the surprise! 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Hey Sandy!
SpongeBob:	 You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab?
Sandy:	  Hey SpongeBob. Hey Patrick.
SpongeBob:	 What are you doing with those bags?
Sandy:	 I'm going back home to Texas.
SpongeBob:	 What?! Now?! You can't! I mean we...
Sandy:	 It's time for this tumbleweed to tumble on home.
SpongeBob:	 Wait Sandy! You can't! Uhh, we we're gonna...the...the...Krusty Krab...that is not the right direction! Wait, if you don't...if I can't...augh! Sandy! Wait a second! You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy:	 I'm tired of fish food, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 But, Sandy, don't you want to say good-bye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy:	  I just can't do that, SpongeBob. It'd be too sad.
SpongeBob:	 No, no! Wait! Sandy!  I can't believe she's gone.
Patrick:	 Yeah. What's so great about dumb ol' Texas? 
Sandy:	 What did you say?
Patrick:	 Texas is dumb?
Sandy:	 Don't you  take the name of Texas in vain!
SpongeBob:	 You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas?
Sandy:	 No, you can't!
Patrick:	 Then can we say people from Texas are dumb?
Sandy:	 No! You can't say nothing about Texas!
SpongeBob:	  Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about...  Texas!
Sandy:	  I'm warnin' you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Look Patrick, I'm Texas! Duh, howdy, y'all! Howdy y'all!
Patrick:	 I'm Texas too! Get a dog little longie! Get a dog!
SpongeBob:	 Howdy y'all!
Patrick:	 Get a dog little longie! Get a dog!
Sandy:	 Y'all best cut it out!
SpongeBob:	  The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas!  Hey, Patrick, what am I now?
Patrick:	 Uhh, stupid?
SpongeBob:	 No, I'm Texas!
Patrick:	 What's the difference?! 
Sandy:	  Y'all best apologize, or I'll be on you like ugly on an ape!
SpongeBob:	 You'll have to catch us first!  We did it! We got her!
Patrick:	 Krusty Krab, here we come!  Can we say that plants from Texas are dumb? Can we say that shoes from Texas are dumb?
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Patrick, that's enough.
Patrick:	 Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna... 
SpongeBob:	 Run faster, Patrick! 
Patrick:	  SpongeBob! 
Sandy:	 Hi-yah!  Y'all gonna take back what ya said!
SpongeBob:	 No! Almost there! 
Sandy:	 SpongeBob, you've been messing with the bull! Now here come the horns!
SpongeBob:	 Sandy, no! 
Everyone:	 Howdy, y'all!
Sandy:	 Wha-what's this?
SpongeBob:	 It's a party!
Patrick:	  For you!
Sandy:	 For me?!
SpongeBob:	 It's your own little slice of Texas! Check it out Sandy! We got square dancing...  ...giant Barbecues... 
Squidward:	 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob:	 ...homemade peas-in-a-can pie...  ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats!  So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay?
SpongeBob:	 Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags.
Sandy:	 [] I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya. 
Sandy:	 Huh, duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.
SpongeBob:	 Does that mean you'll stay?
Sandy:	 I'm staying! 
SpongeBob:	 That makes me feel all wiggly.
Patrick:	 Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas? 
Sandy:	 What did you just say?!
Patrick:	 Should I start running now?
