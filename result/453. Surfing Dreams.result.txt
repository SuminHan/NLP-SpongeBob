SpongeBob:	 Hey, Squidward! Wanna go surfing?
Squidward:	 What? How'd you? When did you?
SpongeBob:	 Come on, Squidward! Since you already got a surfboard and shorts!
Squidward:	  What the?
SpongeBob:	 And since we're all ready at the beach!
Squidward:	  Wha?
SpongeBob:	 In the water with a huge wave behind us! 
Squidward:	 Nooooo! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Squidward! Wanna go surfing?  Hmmm. I guess surfing isn't his thing.
