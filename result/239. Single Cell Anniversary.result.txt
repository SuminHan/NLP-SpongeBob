Karen:	  Plankton, is that you? Welcome home, honey.
Plankton:	 
Karen:	 How was your day?  Dear Neptune, Plankton!  What is that smell?!
Plankton:	 The aroma you speak of, Karen, my computer wife, is the stench of failure!
Stench:	  Failure...
Plankton:	 And now the smell of defeat so deeply penetrates my soul that my very skin is permeated with its foul stench.  Thanks for asking. 
Karen:	 Well, it smells horrible! You're not coming in here smelling like that! 
Plankton:	 Hey! What are you—?
Plankton:	 Stop that at once! You—!
Plankton:	  I command you to—!
Plankton:	  Oh no!
Karen:	 There you go. Now don't you feel better?
Plankton:	  Although I do look ravishing, it's not enough to mask the ugliness I feel inside!
Karen:	 Did I miss a spot? 
Karen:	 Don't blow a gasket, dear. Today's a special day!
Plankton:	  Special day?
Karen:	 Yes. We're celebrating your biggest accomplishment ever!
Plankton:	  Really? I accomplished something? What is it?
Karen:	 It has something with you asking a certain someone to spend the rest of her life with you.
Plankton:	  What?
Karen:	  We each wear rings in memory of this moment.
Plankton:	  Enough with the riddles, woman! Just tell me what this proud moment in my life is!
Karen:	 Oh, you selfish, green twit! It's our wedding anniversary!
Plankton:	  Oh, that.  Yippee. 
Karen:	  You forgot! And I got you the perfect gift!

Karen:	 First I went to the Krusty Krab...
Karen:	  One Krabby Patty, please.
Karen:	  Thank you. 
Squidward:	  Whatever.
Plankton:	 What??? Sorry. I wasn't listening.  Well, you can tell me later. 
Karen:	  You're not getting this until you get me a gift.
Plankton:	 
Karen:	 From your heart.
SpongeBob:	 And that's the story of how I got my head stuck in the fry vat. 
Squidward:	 That story gets better every time you tell it, SpongeBo—
SpongeBob:	  Hold on! Did you hear that? It sounds like...
SpongeBob:	 ...despair.
Squidward:	 That was probably me.
SpongeBob:	 No. No. Not bitterness. Despair. And it's coming from over...  this way.  Plankton! What's wrong, Plankton?
Plankton:	 Wha—? SpongeBob?? Ahh...there's nothing wrong. Don't worry.  I'm...fine.
SpongeBob:	 Come on. Tell your Uncle SpongeBob.
Plankton:	 Oh, it's nothing. It's just that today is my wedding anniversary.
SpongeBob:	 Aww...what present did you buy your wife, huh? What'd you buy her?

SpongeBob:	  Trampling enemies...  Now tell me about Karen.
Plankton:	 Well, she's a Mark-2 Surplus Unevec with 256 Gigs of RAM and uh, and there's the cutest little mole on her CPU, and the way she processes data... Eh-eh oooh mama!
SpongeBob:	 Does she have any hobbies?
Plankton:	 Uhh... well, uhh  she does make a lot of beeping sounds.
SpongeBob:	 Interesting, does she ever go "Ding!"

SpongeBob:	 Oh, when the time comes, you'll know. The music she'll love comes from inside.
Plankton:	 Why are you so obsessed with my internal organs?
SpongeBob:	 This is it, Plankton.
Plankton:	 I don't think I'm ready.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, you just got butterflies in your tummy.
Plankton:	 No, I'm just nervous. I don't know what flying insects have to do with it.
SpongeBob:	   Get in there and sing, you single-celled Romeo, you.  Ah, love.
