Patrick:	  You're it. 
SpongeBob:	  You're it.  Wait, Pat, you're it!  The sign!
Patrick:	 Huh?  Duuhh... aaann... ger...  cliff!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick!  Let me help you out of there, buddy!  Is the rest of you down there?
Patrick:	  The rest of me is up here.
SpongeBob:	 Whew, you had me worried there, buddy.  Here's your head. 
Patrick:	 I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.
SpongeBob:	 Well, let's stop laughin' and start fishing'!  Go ahead, you get first crack.
Patrick:	  Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.
SpongeBob:	 Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.
Patrick:	 Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.
SpongeBob:	 Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets. C'mon, Patrick.  Look buddy, I captured one!
Patrick:	 Yes...  I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner. 
SpongeBob:	 OK...what do you wanna do?
Patrick:	 Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.
SpongeBob:	 Pretty.
Patrick:	 Yes, quite.
SpongeBob:	 Fragile.
Patrick:	 Indeed.
SpongeBob:	  C'mon Patrick, let's do something fun.
Patrick:	 Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?
SpongeBob:	 I was thinking more like jumping rope , 1-legged races [one leg goes inside his body and he hops on his remaining leg], or playing duck-duck-hermit crab. 
Patrick:	 Doesn't feel like fun.
SpongeBob:	 How about some jokes?  Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?
