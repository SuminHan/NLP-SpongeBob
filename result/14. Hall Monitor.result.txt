Narrator:	 Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Where diligent students learn the rules of the road.
Mrs. Puff:	 Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day!  Let's see here. This weeks hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm...  ...SpongeBob.  It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor.
Jimmy:	 Mrs. Puff, I've done it already! 
Mrs. Puff:	 Ohh... Phil?
Phil:	 No way, Mrs. Puff. 
Mrs. Puff:	 Uhh, Tina, you're the hall monitor.
Tina:	 Hey, I've done it three times already! 
Mrs. Puff:	 B...uh...B-Beth!
Student:	 She graduated!
Mrs. Puff:	 Henry?  Vera?  Clayton?  Alright, I guess I have no choice.  The hall monitor of the day is  SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob:	 Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
Mrs. Puff:	 Okay! Just take the hat and belt. 
SpongeBob:	 I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First I have to make my speech.
Mrs. Puff:	 You can't make this easy, can you?
SpongeBob:	 Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff:	 Give me a break.
SpongeBob:	 And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties...  ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall!  Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time.  "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears."  In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform  and assume my duties as...  ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff!  Oh, and I will be re... 
Mrs. Puff:	 SpongeBob, are you okay?
SpongeBob:	 I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
Mrs. Puff:	 I'm afraid so.
SpongeBob:	 Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this.  I hardly knew ya. 
Mrs. Puff:	 Uhh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff:	 I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.
SpongeBob:	 A-hoo!  Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff:	 What are the consequences of what I've just done? 
SpongeBob:	 Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor!  What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
Fred:	 My leg! My leg.
SpongeBob:	 On patrol. I'm on patrol.  Uh-oh, an open window. 
Vera:	 More seaweed medley, dear?
SpongeBob:	 The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example.  I'm the open window maniac!  I hope you learned a valuable lesson!  On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol...  Vandals! Another crime.  hmm...strawberry! I must act!  Patrick...  Patrick... Patrick...
Patrick:	 My ice cream! It's alive! 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick! Down here!
Patrick:	 Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick. Come down here. 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 I'm down here.
Patrick:	 Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 That's hall monitor to you!
Patrick:	 Sorry, officer.
SpongeBob:	 Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
Patrick:	 What crime?  I'm a bad person! 
Newspaper Boy:	 Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom! City paralyzed with fear!  Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge.  Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob:	  Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wreck? Break-in? Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
Patrick:	  I wanna be good!
SpongeBob:	 Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority.  Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
Patrick:	 Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! 
SpongeBob:	 Okay, now what?
Patrick:	 Hmmm... 
SpongeBob:	 This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies!  And now, duty calls! Alright deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run em out! 
Officer Rob:	 Afternoon, son.
Patrick:	 Hello, brothers. 
Officer Rob:	 Son, we're looking for the maniac.
Officer John:	 Have you seen this man?! 
Patrick:	  It's the maniac! Take him away! Take him away!
Officer Rob:	 Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy, understand?
Patrick:	 Yeah, uh huh.
Officer Rob:	 Okay. 
Patrick:	  Horrible!
Officer John:	 
Patrick:	 
Officer Rob:	 Stay indoors, son.
Officer John:	 And, uhh, take that cone off your head. 
Patrick:	  SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer.
SpongeBob:	 SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
Patrick:	  I don't wanna be a policeman anymore! I'm scared!
SpongeBob:	 Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
Patrick:	  I wanna go home!
SpongeBob:	 Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
Patrick:	 Hurry SpongeBob, I think it's getting...  ...dark.
SpongeBob:	 Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
Patrick:	 Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo.  Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
SpongeBob:	  Where is he, Patrick?
Patrick:	  At the intersection of Conch and Coral. 
SpongeBob:	 That's where I am. He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
Patrick:	 Uhh, he's just standing there... menacingly!  Get out of there, SpongeBob!  That's his maniac shriek. He's going to attack!  He's acting all crazy! Run! Hide behind that building!  No, he's behind that building! Oh, quick, hide behind that street sign!  No wait! The maniac just went behind that sign! Quick! Get under the street light!  No wait, he's there, too! Run for your life! 
SpongeBob:	  Say again, deputy?
Patrick:	 The maniac's in the mailbox! 
SpongeBob:	  Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick,  the maniac! 
Officer Durado:	 We'll take that as a confession. 
Mrs. Puff:	 SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself!
Officer #1:	 You know this guy?
Mrs. Puff:	 Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility.  Uh-oh...  And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...
SpongeBob:	  Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff:	 I'd like to see you after class. Six months from now.
