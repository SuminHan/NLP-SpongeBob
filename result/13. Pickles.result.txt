Mr. Krabs:	 Don't talk like that!
SpongeBob:	 Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate! I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works!  I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order!

Bubble Bass:	 Hmm... ...Still no pickles!  See?  You failed again, SpongeBob "Loser"Pants! 
SpongeBob:	 Wait a minute!  Look!  He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
