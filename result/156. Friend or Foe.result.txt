French Narrator:	 We take you now to Encino, California, where we find the President of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club flipping burgers?
Patchy:	 Hey,kids! Potty and I took jobs as fry cooks so we could be just like our hero SpongeBob SquarePants!
Potty:	 I took the job for the free sodas.
Patchy:	 Potty, don't you have some dishes to wash?
Mr. Pirateson:	 Arrrrrrrrrgh!
Patchy:	 Hey, kids! Say hello to my boss, Mr. Pirateson.
Mr. Pirateson:	 Arrrrrrrrrgh! 
Patchy:	  One order of scurvy fries, one large bilge water.
Mr. Pirateson:	 Arrrrrrrrrgh! Arrrrrrrrrrgh!
Patchy:	 Oh, I'm sorry. Diet bilge water. Better get on it sir.  Owwwwwww!
Potty:	 P.U.! What are you cooking?
Patchy:	 Oh, Potty, you're just in time to see me new pirate patties. I call this one "Buried Treasure". 
Potty:	 Where'd you dig that one up?
Patchy:	 I call this one "Walk the Plank". 
Potty:	 I'm already "board" with that one.
Patchy:	 This'll blow out your old bird brain of yours. Behold! The Patchy Patty! 
Patchy Patty:	 Ahoy!
Potty:	 Aw, that's the worst one yet.
Patchy:	 Potty the Parrot, you are never supported of me! I don't wanna be your friend anymore! I never wanna see you again!
Potty:	 Brawk, Patchy, no!  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Brawk! Brawk!
Patchy:	 You know kids this isn't the first time a perfect patty's come between two good friends.
Patchy:	 It happened once in Bikini Bottom.
Patchy:	 Here, take a look while I pull myself together. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hmmm, something ain't right.  For me?
Squidward:	 Don't you find this a tad suspicious?
Mr. Krabs:	 Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing. 
Plankton:	 Surprise! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Me secret formula!
Plankton:	 Happy Birthday Krabs!
SpongeBob:	 Don't forget your condiments, Plankton. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Attaboy, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob:	 Safe.
Plankton:	 You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs. I'll be back.  Oh, barnacles. 
SpongeBob:	 Why, Mr Krabs? Why does he hate us so? 
Mr. Krabs:	 You might as well blame me, SpongeBob.  There was a time when Plankton and I were best friends. 
SpongeBob:	 Best friends?
Mr. Krabs:	 Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones. 
Plankton:	 Goo! 
Everyone:	 Aw!
Mr. Krabs:	 Things were all peaches and creams.  Until we hit grade school.
Kid Mr. Krabs:	 Hey, Planky, whatcha doing?
Kid Plankton:	 Oh, just a little something I thought I'd try out.  Idiots! I'll show you with science! This concoction is going to blow everyone away. 
Classmate:	 How's this for a science experiment, Mr. Brainatron 5000? 
Kid Plankton:	 They'll pay for this one day Eugene!
Mr. Krabs:	 Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.
Classmate:	 You're right, Plankton, I'm sorry. Sorry you have to hang out with rag boy. 
Classmate #2:	 Yeah. Where'd you do your clothes shopping? The trash can?
Mr. Krabs:	 'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash.  You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to  fashion me clothes from rags.
Mama Krabs:	 There you go, son. Your outfit's all finished. It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth.
Old Man Jenkins:	 Oops.  I missed a spot.
Mr. Krabs:	 Then one day, as Plankton and I were plotting our revenge, I met the love of me life.
Kid Mr. Krabs:	 What in Neptune's name is that?  It's the most beautiful thing me eyes have ever seen! What is it?!
Kid Plankton:	 It's money.
Mr. Krabs:	 Money?
Plankton:	 Yeah. You can buy things with it.
Mr. Krabs:	 Buy things? So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton. 
All:	 Wow!
SpongeBob:	 Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea that went through to get here.
Mr. Krabs:	 I've got a pretty good idea, yeah. 
SWAT Fish #4:	 So, if you guys were such great friends, what happened?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?
Squidward:	 Yeah. I really wanna know.
Mr. Krabs:	 Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called "Stinky Burgers". It was the only place to get a burger. Kids loved Stinky's.  And Stinky loved the kids.
Stinky:	 Now, what can I do for you young 'uns?
Classmate:	 Uh, Mr. Stinky? I'll have one Stinky Burger, please!
Fish #2:	 Me, too, Stinky!
Stinky:	 Oh, now, now, kids. There's plenty of burgers for everyone. 
Fish #3:	 That's why we like you so much, Stinky. You always deliver the goods.
Fish #4:	 We don't like Stinky, we respect him.
Stinky:	 Well, which one is it, kids? Do you like me or respect me?
Fish #3:	 Like!
Fish #4:	 Respect!
Fish #3:	 Like!
Fish #4:	 Respect!
Stinky:	 Ok, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Excuse us!
Plankton:	 Valuable customers coming through.
Fish #3:	 What are those dorks doing here?
Mr. Krabs:	 Two Stinky Burgers, please.
Stinky:	  Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night? If it's burgers you want, go around back.
All:	 Yeah, Stinky!
Classmate:	 Thanks for keeping the nerds out.
Classmate #2:	 You're the best, Stinky.
Stinky:	 Ok, that's enough, kids. Gather around, children. There's something I want to tell you. What I have to say is very important. If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy.  Do you two have kelp for brains? Don't you understand? If you two yahoos come around, you'll drive away all the normal customers. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a li-spectable business. As it is, I can barely afford the essential things in li...  Is it quitting time already?  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy some of life's essentials. 
Plankton:	 Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipper burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.
Mr. Krabs:	 Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if we made a better burger, we'd make a fatter stack of loot.  But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?
Plankton:	 Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school! 
Patchy:	 I miss Potty. I remember the first time we met.  If I could only hear his voice.
Potty:	 Less talking and more working.
Patchy:	  Potty! You came back to apologize!
Potty:	 I came to tell you to get back to work!
Patchy:	 Hey, you can't tell me what to do you... Huh? Assistant manager? How did you become assistant manager?
Potty:	 Oh a thing called the G.E.D., man.
Patchy:	 Oh, here we go again with the fancy booklearnin'. Customers love me cookin. Why, we're almost out of doggie bags.
Patchy:	 Oh Potty, what am I doing wrong?
Potty:	 You just need some practice, that's all.
Patchy:	 Ahh, me patty's done.
Potty:	 Smells like an unswabbed poop deck!
Patchy:	 Oh, Fine. I'll eat it!  Oh, for the crime of foaling me taste buds, I order you to walk the plank!  Ah. Oh well, I bet SpongeBob's first patty didn't go so well either.
Potty:	 Brawk, roll film.  A perfect patty on the first try.
Patchy:	 Oooooh, I'll make a Potty Patty out of you!
Potty:	 You're unsanitary, Patchy, You keep raw hamburger meat in an old boot!
Patchy:	 Well, that's what gives it its special flavor. 
Potty:	 You've got rats in the kitchen!
Patchy:	 Oh, I brush and shampoo them daily. Who's Patchy's little princess?  Owwwwwwwww! Mmmmmm! Don't do that!
Potty:	 And you should wash your hands after using the bathroom.
Patchy:	 What? Everytime?
Potty:	 That's not all! This is a step in the right direction.
Patchy:	 What kind of a pirate wears a hairnet?
Potty:	 The same kind who wears a "Kiss the Cook" apron.
Patchy:	 Well, you'll never know, Potty. I might get lucky. You hear that, ladies? Patchy's available. Huh? 
Potty:	 Now I feel sick.
Patchy:	 That's it, you feathered snake! This time you gone too far!
Potty:	 Brawk, you missed! Squawk! Is that all you got?
Potty:	 Now you've done it.
Mr. Pirateson:	  Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
Patchy:	 Yes, Mr. Pirateson.  You kids watch the rest of the cartoon, while I watch Potty get fired.
Mr. Pirateson:	 Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
Patchy:	 Coming, Mr. Pirateson, sir.
Mr. Krabs:	 So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress. 
Plankton:	 Gently. Gently. 
Mr. Krabs:	 We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kid's greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant.  Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please. 
Plankton:	 There you are, sir.
Mr. Krabs:	 T'was me first dollar I ever earned, and was also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.
Fish #5:	 Hey! Your burger's even worse than Stinky's. We can barely keep them down. And if it weren't for Stinky's shutting down, no one would eat here. So give me a burger. I'm starving.
Plankton:	 Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.
Mr. Krabs:	 I thought it was our recipe.
Plankton:	 I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds! 
Mr. Krabs:	 But what about satisfying the customer?
Plankton:	 Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world!  And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Mr. Krabs:	 Give me that!
Plankton:	 Stop! You're gonna bust it! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!
Plankton:	 I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?
Mr. Krabs:	 Which one? The one that says "Eject" or the one that says "Trap Door"?
Plankton:	 Oh, either one will do.
Mr. Krabs:	 What I was saying was...  You'll regret this one day!  And he always did.
Plankton:	  Lies! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.
Plankton:	 Very touching, but completely false.
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't know what you mean.
Plankton:	 Why don't you tell them the truth?
SpongeBob:	 It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?
Plankton:	 Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory. 
Mr. Krabs:	 First, I'll rule their stomachs and then...  ...their money! 
Plankton:	 But what about satisfying the customers?
Mr. Krabs:	 Barnacles to the customers!  I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Plankton:	 Gimme that! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Stop, you're gonna bust it. 
Plankton:	 This isn't about money, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs:	 Malarkey. 
Plankton:	 You'll regret this one day!  Ouch.  Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.
SpongeBob:	 Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all.
Karen:	 That's because it isn't.
SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, & Plankton:	 Karen?!
Karen:	 You're both liars. That's not how it happened at all. In those days, I was just starting out as a security system. Plankton and I met when he installed me.
Plankton:	 It was only our third date.
Karen:	 Anyways, I had recorded the whole thing in my databanks. 
Plankton:	 Now that's a handsome looking burger.
Mr. Krabs:	 You said it, old chum.  Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here!  Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump? 
Plankton:	 What's that music?
Mr. Krabs:	 I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins! 
Old Man Jenkins:	 I just been looking for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie.
Mr. Krabs:	 You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.
Old Man Jenkins:	 Why, I'd be happy to! 
Mr. Krabs & Plankton:	 Yeah! 
Mr. Krabs:	 "Plab Patties KO's Old Man J". I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy.
Plankton:	 Well, he is old.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey. that guy is like family to me.
Plankton:	 Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.
Mr. Krabs:	 You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger.
Plankton:	 You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.
Mr. Krabs:	 No way, that recipe's mine! 
Plankton:	 Stop, you're gonna...  You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything.  I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.
Karen:	 Meanwhile, Plankton was back at the elementary school. But this time, he was going it alone. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, no you don't! This is my turf.
Plankton:	 I think not, Rag Boy.
Mr. Krabs:	 What? Why I oughta squash you right now. You little...
Plankton:	 Get out of my face! 
Fish #6:	 Hey, look! Nerd fight.
Bully:	 I bet five bucks on Rag Boy.
Plankton:	 Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.
Classmate:	 Big Johnny will eat anything. 
Plankton:	 Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir. 
Karen:	 Plankton had pieced together his own creation using memory and science.
Plankton:	 Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think! 
Classmate:	 I'm gonna try one of Rag Boy's burgers.
Mr. Krabs:	 Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty. 
Classmate:	 Flavor!
Fish #7:	 Edible!
Kid Fish:	 We can actually hold it down!
Fish #8:	 This is the most flavortastic sensation my still-developing taste buds have ever experienced!
All:	 Yay, Rag Boy!
Plankton:	 I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop till I do! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best.
Plankton:	 You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me.
Mr. Krabs:	 You callin' me a liar?
Karen:	 Will you men stop yelling at each other? I can't believe you let a recipe ruin such a wonderful friendship. 
Mr. Krabs:	 You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back.
Plankton:	 My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.
Mr. Krabs:	 Really?
Plankton:	 It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?
Mr. Krabs:	 I'd like that, Planky, old chum. 
SpongeBob:	 Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?
Karen:	 I suppose it would. If I had one.
Plankton:	 I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy.
Mr. Krabs:	 Me, too. Me, too. 
Plankton:	 Now, Karen!  Back off, Rag Boy. 
SpongeBob:	  Sabotage!
Plankton:	 Go, Karen! 
Patchy:	 Ohh, that Plankton never learns does he kids. As for me I decited to take some time off to catch up on me reading. 
Potty:	 Hey, you didn't take time off, you got fired!
Patchy:	 Hey, you got fired, too!
Potty:	 I got a golden parachute.
Patchy:	 Well, at least I know they won't ever be able to replace me.
Potty:	 Brawk, looks like they already did.
Patchy:	 What? They let a smelly, hairy, flea bag like that serve food?
Gorilla:	 Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh!
Patchy:	 Shh!
Patchy:	 Ow! Ow! Ow!
Gorilla:	 Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh...!
Patchy:	 Hey, watch it, I have a tomato allergy! Hey, watch the butt!
Narrator:	 And so kids, always remember to follow your dreams, unless you're Patchy, and just stay in bed.
