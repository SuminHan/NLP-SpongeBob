Mr. Krabs:	 Come on, boys! Get me to the green mats!
Fake Plankton:	 I think not, old man! Turbo boost, Karen! 
Mr. Krabs:	  Nooo! I can't let him win!
Sandy:	 Don't worry, he won't!  I will.  Yeeha!
Patrick:	  Hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Hi Patrick! Where's your sleigh?
Patrick:	 I don't know. 
SpongeBob:	 Hop in!  Come on, Gary!
Plankton:	 Hehehehe!  Locked?! Ugh.[takes out cutter]Good thing I brought this along.[tries to cut safe, but the cutter slides to the ceiling with Plankton, spins 3 circles, makes two holes in ceiling, falls off, cuts off Plankton's antennae, and rolls away]I'm gonna need something with more firepower.
Sandy:	 Woo wee! Looks like I lost them!  The remote shorted out! The robots,  Whoa!  Aaaa!
Squidward:	 Those dimwits don't stand a chance against my imported worm.  Hey! What's the big idea?!
Worm:	  I beg your pardon. It's tea time, anyway. 
Squidward:	 I don't have time for this!  Tea time. Of all the ridiculous concepts![walks onto ice, and slips, the ice cracks, and Squidward falls in, losing his winter clothes, and floats back up in a block of ice, with a shocked face]
Patrick:	 Whoa! Look at that!
SpongeBob:	 Squidward! Free!  He doesn't look so "hot." We better take him with us.
Patrick:	 Good idea.
Gary:	 Mooow... 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, do you hear that?
Sandy:	 [shivering] Th-th-th-th-th-thanks, guys.
SpongeBob:	 No problem, right, Gar?
Gary:	 Meow...  Errrgg!
Mr. Krabs:	 Sniff out the money, little guys! Come on! Marsh!  Wai-wait a minute. I was gonna feed ya! Honest! 
Mr. Krabs:	  Heeelp!
SpongeBob:	 Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 I just been turned into lunchmeat by me own worms! 
SpongeBob:	 Aaaaa! Hop in, sir! We'll get you out of here!
Mr. Krabs:	  Much appreciate it, boy! 
Everyone except Squidward:	 Faster! Faster! Faster!
Gary:	 Mooowww... 
Everyone:	 Faster! Faster!
Everyone:	 FASTER! 
SpongeBob:	 This is a dead end! >]
Everyone:	 aaaaa!
Gary:	 Rooooooooarr!  Meow. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Great. Now we're trapped.
Mr. Krabs:	 Good thinkin', squirrel! This should keep us alive for at least... a few hours... oh...
Patrick:	  It's-s-s... so c-c-cold!
SpongeBob:	 Hey! How about a campfire song? 
Squidward:	 No! Singing!
Everyone:	 Squidward! 
Squidward:	  Alright, alright! Someone get me a blanket. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Hey Squidward, what is it with the extra foot, buddy?
Squidward:	  Huh? This isn't mine...  Waaaahhh! 
All:	 
Mr. Krabs:	 Not you again!
Sandy:	 Ha! Slimeless snow vermin! You missed!
Mr. Krabs:	 That's weren't the attack.
Sandy:	 Huh?
Mr. Krabs:	 This is it! 
SpongeBob:	 Gary! 
Squidward:	  Oh... not again... 
Mr. Krabs:	 
SpongeBob:	 What is that formidable creature?
Mr. Krabs:	 That, me boy, is none other than the Abominable Snow Mollusk.
SpongeBob:	 I thought that was just a myth.
Mr.Krabs:	 Oh, you sure? She's no myth! She's as real as Santy Claus. Back when I was young sea captain,  sailing in the Atlantic sea.[???] 
SpongeBob:	 Don't tell me, Mr. Krabs. You peeled at those tentacles with your bare claws! You single-handedly saved your vessel from certain DOOM!
Mr. Krabs:	 Nope, that didn't work.  [???] 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, my! Well at least you bravely escaped out the tail.
Mr. Krabs:	 Weren't bravery that got us out. Let's just say... We had to wait... for nature, to take its course. 
SpongeBob:	 Hm? Oh! Ew.
Sandy:	 I'd hate to break up story time, but I'd like to NOT GET EATEN today! 
SpongeBob:	 Gary! Step on it!  Oh yeah, Gary, you are really motivated now! Right, guys?  We forgot Squidward!  Left, Gary! Left! There he is!
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, I need a Gooey Worm!
Patrick:	 Oh, be careful, this is my last one! 
SpongeBob:	 Hold on tight! 
Gary:	 Meow. 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob! Come on!  Let's get outta here! 
Sandy:	 Woo, wee! That was a close one, wasn't it, Mr. Krabs? Huh?  Of all the horn swabbles! The banit's trying to win us out so he can get the prize himself! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Argargarg! I'd sooner swallow a jellyfish the winning with y-- 
Sandy:	 We can't let that double crosser beat us to the loot! Full speed ahead and don't stop for nothin', Gary!
Patrick:	 Hey! 
Sandy:	  What's the big emergency, Patrick?
Patrick:	 I saw something shiny.
Sandy:	  Oh! Well, let's drop EVERYTHING, then!
SpongeBob:	 No wait Sandy, I see it too! It looks like... Karen.
SpongeBob:	  Karen?
Sandy:	 I say she's in quick need of a reboot! Heee ya! 
SpongeBob:	  Huh?  Plankton?  Poor guy, the ice is really getting to him.
Patrick:	  We gotta bust him out, quick! I'm gonna sit on him! 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, no! He's very--...fragile. 
Sandy:	 A citylacra!
SpongeBob:	  Sandy, please! Language!
Sandy:	 Naw, silly! I'm saying, Plankton set up a robotic dummy in his sled!
Karen:	 That's right. My selfish husband remains in warm, sunny Bikini Bottom,[???], in fact,  this whole race was a plot devised by Plankton.  With the entire town distracted, he pursues the Krabby Patty formula undetected.
SpongeBob:	 Pursue? Formula? We've gotta find Mr. Krabs right now!
Sandy:	 And exactly how do you propose we find him?
Karen:	 I saw Mr. Krabs pass by  just before my system failed, heading southwest.
SpongeBob:	 Well, what are we waiting for?  You heard the lady, Gary, southwest! Marsh! Marsh!
Plankton:	  Hehehehe!  Yooooouch!  So the safe isn't[???]of flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more DESTRUCTIVE!  Ahem! I meant DESTRUCTIVE! 
Gary:	 '[tired]' Mooowww, meow meow meow moooww...
SpongeBob:	 A little more, Gary!
All:	 AAAAA!
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 Ahh, whew.
Sandy:	 Look out! 
SpongeBob & Patrick:	 
Sandy:	 Hold on, SpongeBob! 
SpongeBob:	  We made it! Right, Squidward? 
Sandy:	 Gasp! Oh my gosh! Patrick! Wing to the other side!  Excuse me, ma'am
Karen:	 What?
Sandy:	 Gotcha!
SpongeBob:	 Hey Sandy, have you given any thought to we're gonna--...land. 
Plankton:	  Fire in the hole!  Rats.
Sandy:	 Look, fellas, I know it's cold. But let's just push forward and keep a lookout for a frozen crab! 
Patrick:	  I can't feel my looking holes!
SpongeBob:	 The only thing I can feel is my empty stomach. 
Sandy:	 You said it, SpongeBob! I already gnawed through my[???]  I'm getting to the point where I can eat just about ANYTHING!  Mmmm... sponge kabob...  Hey Patrick, you got any more of that Gooey Worms on you?
Patrick:	 I wish I did. I lost my last one to the monster and now I'm so hungry! At least,  I still have this bag of Jelly Beans to hold me over.  Hey! Is this taxi even moving?!  Come on, Gary! 
SpongeBob:	 Gasp! Gary!  Oh, you poor fella! We put you too hard to[???]Sorry, I won't make you[???]another inch. 
Patrick:	 Great, now we're stuck.
SpongeBob:	 No, we're not! We'll-- Hello, what's this?  Look! One of Mr. Krabs's sailor tattoos! It must've frozen off his brittle body.
Sandy:	 We must be heading in the right direction!
Plankton:	   Secret formula, you are mine! 
Plankton:	 Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one.  That does it! Listen up safe, I will steal your content, even if I have to tear you apart.  Bit by bit.  Molecule by molecule.  Atom by atom!  Uh-oh.
Plankton:	 Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa! 
Patrick:	  Hey, trying to sleep.
SpongeBob:	  Mr. Krabs!
Sandy:	 He doesn't look so good. We better get him to the sleigh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob? SpongeBob! He froze up too. 
Squidward:	 Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh? Are you aware that's our mode of transportation?
Sandy:	 And are you aware I just saved your life?
Mr. Krabs:	 The race! The million clams!  I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings. 
Karen:	 Oh cool down there are no winnings, you've been duped!
Mr. Krabs:	 Duped? You don't mean by...
Karen:	 Now you're putting it together!
Mr. Krabs:	 My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!
Squidward:	  We's might have actually a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh.
Mr. Krabs:	 We're doomed. Oh hoho! 
SpongeBob:	  No we're not Mr. Krabs.  Your chariot awaits!
Mr. Krabs:	 No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace.
Sandy:	 Just leave that to the scientist of the group!
Patrick:	  Oh geez... why do I have to do everything?
Sandy:	 
Patrick:	 Hahahaha!
Sandy:	 She's all fired up!
SpongeBob:	 Gary, Mr. Krabs, any hazards on the horizon?
Mr. Krabs:	 Lookin' clear so far.
SpongeBob:	 Squidward keep those circuits warm. Patrick hang on!
French Narrator:	 One frozen wasteland later.
SpongeBob:	 Hooray! We made it.
Mr. Krabs:	 Okay... then where's my restaurant?
SpongeBob:	 Perhaps over there.. 
Mr. Krabs:	 And where's my formula? 
Sandy:	  Perhaps over there.
Mr. Krabs:	 The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?! 
SpongeBob:	 We're too late!
Mr. Krabs:	 We'll see about that boy-o!
Harold:	  Woah woah woah woah, you can't cut in line. We've been waiting for a Krabby Patty for three stinking days!
Mr. Krabs:	 This will only take a minute. 
Plankton:	  Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!
Plankton:	 Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?
Mr. Krabs:	 I guess I didn't want to miss the grand unveiling of my sandwich.
Plankton:	  Well it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!
Patrick:	 Oh, that's easy! 
All of them:	 PATRICK!
Plankton:	 Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy. 
Sandy:	  That may be true Plankton but you've got seven angry customers flanking you on all sides.
Plankton:	 : Uh... well I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob. You-you've gotta help me here Karen!
Karen:	  You've gotta help me... My monitor nearly froze up for good on your little race to oblivion!
Plankton:	 Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon! 
Plankton:	 Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Then hand over my formula.
Plankton:	 Okay Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first.  Oops, here I go. Hahahaha! Looks like I've out smarted you again aye fools? 
Mr. Krabs:	 You get back here, Plankton!
SpongeBob:	  Here we go again...
Plankton:	 
Mr. Krabs:	 Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!
Plankton:	 I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh, you're so close.  So long suckers!
Mr. Krabs:	 Huh?
Everyone:	 [gasps when they realize they’re inside a cage]
Plankton:	 Hehehe!
Mr. Krabs:	 We're trapped!
Plankton:	 That's right Krabs and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you.
Mr. Krabs:	 He's going to turn us into fried snacks!
Plankton:	 Got any dipping sauce? A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?
Abominable Snow Mollusk:	  Nom nom!
SpongeBob:	 Nom nom?
Abominable Snow Mollusk:	 Nom nom!  Nom nom!
SpongeBob:	 W-wait big scary monster. Don't eat Patrick. Eat me packed with nutrients!
Sandy:	 No, eat me!
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't eat me, eat Squidward!
Squidward:	 Wait what?!
Abominable Snow Mollusk:	  Nom nom! 
SpongeBob:	 She loves your jellybeans Patrick!
Plankton:	 I better go while the going's good.
Abominable Snow Mollusk:	  Jellybean!
Plankton:	 I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happens to Plankton?
Mr. Krabs:	 He'll have to wait for nature to take its' course. 
Plankton:	  Well I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration.
