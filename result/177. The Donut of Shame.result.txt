Patrick:	 Wha...? What happened? Where am I!?  Oh yeah, the party! I must've passed out in SpongeBob's kitchen... on the ceiling.  See, SpongeBob, I told you we shouldn't stay up past 8:30. Things get real crazy after 8:30! 
SpongeBob:	 Would you like another spot of tea, Ms. Nibsy? Oh, you would? 
Patrick:	 Whooooo! Chamomile, chamomile, chamomile! Oh, she really knows how to pound 'em down, huh, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob... SpongeBob? Sponge-  That's a good lookin' donut... Wow...  ...This donut's connected to SpongeBob! Oh...  It worked!  A beautiful specimen of donut-hood. A donut this nice deserves to be served on fine china!  The good plate.  Don't worry, donut. No longer will you suffer the indignity of sub-par dining wear! I don't think I've ever seen a donut this nice before...  Except maybe that donut SpongeBob showed me last night... 
SpongeBob:	 A donut this nice could  make a guy happy! 
Patrick:	  This is SpongeBob's delicious...  Wai... I 'ant eat 'is 'onut...!  It's SpongeBob's! 
Red Donut:	 Go on and eat it. What are you waiting for?
White Donut:	 Don't do it! It's SpongeBob's donut! 
Red Donut:	 Don't listen to him, he's covered in sprinkles.
Patrick:	  ...I hate conflicts!!
Red Donut:	 It couldn't get any easier than this. Just hook a chain to it,  pop it in your mouth, and then when your sponge friend wants it back just yank it out.
White Donut:	 I hate to admit it, but that's a great idea! 
Patrick:	  And now...  SpongeBob's donut, I ate it!  I've gotta sneak this back into SpongeBob's house before he-  Hello...?
SpongeBob:	  Hey, Patrick.
Patrick:	 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Star. It's SquarePants. That was some party last night, huh, buddy?
Patrick:	 
SpongeBob:	 That's exactly how I feel about it.  Luckily, I videotaped the whole party so we can relive it over and over and over again.
Patrick:	 Ah, don't watch that tape..!
SpongeBob:	 I'm waiting to watch it with you, Sillyfish! I'll be right over.  Sheesh, Patrick's so excited. I better not keep him waiting!
Patrick:	 Oh, no... that video will show me stealing SpongeBob's donut..! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, eee, eee! I gotta hide this thing.  Whew...  Oh... 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Patrick, I-  *Gasp* Donut! You monster...! You monster!  Nothing goes with a video like toast, Let's pop some toast in the toaster and watch this bad boy! 
Patrick:	 Ow, hot, hot, hot, ow! 
SpongeBob:	 Get out of the way, Patrick, I gotta go! 
Patrick:	  ...The attic!  Wait... I don't have an attic!   Oh... Ooh! I know! the attic.  
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Patrick!
Patrick:	 Ah! H-hey, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Are you ready to-
Patrick:	 I don't have anything behind my back! So don't look there! 
SpongeBob:	 Ok... No problem. Ready to see this?  The official testament of how heartily we party... hardy? 
Patrick:	 No!  I took it, SpongeBob! I took your donut...! I'm sorry!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Patrick! you  need to see this video!  I wanna give you this, because you're my buddy and... A donut this nice could really make a guy happy... 
Patrick:	 You mean...  This is mine?
SpongeBob:	 Of course! It was your birthday!
Patrick:	 ...When?
SpongeBob:	 ...Last night, silly!
Patrick:	 Oh... Thanks, buddy!  Hey, Wanna share it?
SpongeBob:	 Sure, pal! 
Patrick:	 Yeah, Pretty good, huh?
