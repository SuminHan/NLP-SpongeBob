Patrick:	 A chocolate bar?
SpongeBob:	 That's a great idea, Pat! We'll become traveling chocolate bar salesmen!

Tom:	 Chocolate?! CHOCOLATE?!?!?! CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAATE! CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAAATE!
Con man:	 Chocolate bars, eh?
SpongeBob:	 Yes sir, we ARE chocolate bar salesmen!
Con man:	 Ha! A couple of mediocre salesmen if you ask me. That's no way to carry your merchandise!
Con man:	 No, no no no, WRONG. You guys wanna be good salesmen, right?
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Oh, most certainly, sir!
Con man:	 Well,  no self respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these! 
SpongeBob:	 Woooooooow... what is it?
Con man:	 It's a candy bar bag, you knuckle-head! It's specially designed to cradle each candy bar in velvet-lined comfort!
Con man:	  BUT, I'm wasting my time.  You don't need these bags.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 We need 'em! We need 'em!
Con man:	 So long, boys! Happy hunting!  Suckers... 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	  Fancy livin', here we come! La la la la, la!
SpongeBob:	 Let's try next door!
Con man:	 Yes?
SpongeBob:	 Huh? Say, weren't you the same guy who sold us these candy bar bags?
Con man:	 I... don't recall. But it looks to me like you fellas have got a lot of bags there. You two lady killers are too smart to be without one of my patented Candy Bar Bag Carrying Bags. 
Patrick:	 We'll take twenty!
Sadie:	 Oh, what can I do for you two nice young men?
SpongeBob:	 We're selling chocolate bars. Would you like to buy one?

SpongeBob:	 -lady.  We're not doing so well, Patrick. We need a new approach, a new tactic.
Patrick:	 Hm... I got it! Let's get naked!
SpongeBob:	 No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate... There must be SOMETHING. What was the reason we bought those bags?
Patrick:	 He said we were mediocre...
SpongeBob:	 That's it! He made us feel special!
Patrick:	 Yeah, he did... I'm going back to buy more bags!
SpongeBob:	 NO, wait Patrick!

Patrick:	 Oh, okay.
SpongeBob:	 Remember Patrick, flatter the customer. Make him feel good.
Blue Fish with purple stripes:	 Hello?
Patrick:	 I love you.
SpongeBob:	 I think you laid it on a teensy bit thick there, old pal. Let me try.
Blue Fish with purple stripes:	 Please, G-Go away.
SpongeBob:	 Um,  H-H-How you doin'?
Blue Fish with purple stripes:	 How am I doing?
SpongeBob:	 Wanna buy some chocolate?
Patrick:	 We got him now!
Blue Fish with purple stripes:	 Sorry, chocolate has sugar and sugar turns to bubbling fat. Isn't that right, blubber boy?
Patrick:	 Hee hee, it tickles!
Blue Fish with purple stripes:	 As you can see, me and chocolate no longer hang.
Blue Fish with purple stripes:	 You can keep that for 5 bucks.
Patrick:	 I'll take 10!
SpongeBob:	 We haven't sold one chocolate bar. I got a feeling that were too easily distracted.
Patrick:	 Huh?
SpongeBob:	  Let's make a pact right now that we will stay focused on selling at the next house.
Patrick:	  Huh?
SpongeBob:	  Let's shake on it.
Patrick:	  Did you say something?
SpongeBob:	 Remember Patrick, focus.
Purple Fish:	 Yes?

SpongeBob:	 I can't understand what were doing wrong.
Patrick:	 I can't understand anything
SpongeBob:	 There's something to this selling game were just not getting. Other people do it, I mean look at that!
Patrick:	  Eat Barnacle Chips, they're delicious.
SpongeBob:	 They are most certainly not delicious!
Patrick:	  Not the way I use them!
SpongeBob:	 Yet they sell millions of bags a day!
Patrick:	 Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth, they wouldn't sell as many.
SpongeBob:	  That's it, Patrick! We've gotta stretch the truth!
Tom:	 CHOCOLATE!
SpongeBob:	 We'll work as a team. Let me get this customer warmed up and you come in for the kill!
Patrick:	 The kill!
Mary:	 Yes?
SpongeBob:	 Hello, young lady.

Mary:	 YEAH!
Mother:	 Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate.
Mother:	 I always hated it!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, but this chocolate's not for eating. It's for...
Patrick:	 You rub it on your skin and it makes you live forever.
Mother:	 Live forever you say? I'll take one. 
Mother:	  Come on, you lazy Mary!  Start rubbing me with that chocolate!
Mary:	  I hate you. 
SpongeBob:	 If we keep exaggerating the truth, we'll be fancy living in no time!
Patrick:	  Hooray for lying!
SpongeBob:	 It'll make your hair grow.
Fred:	 Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!
SpongeBob:	 It'll make you sound smart.
Customer:	  I'll take 20!
Patrick:	 It'll keep your face from getting any uglier.

SpongeBob:	  You'll rule the world!
Patrick:	 This'll be the best lie yet!
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, this guy will feel sorry for us, he'll have to buy all of our chocolate!
Customer:	 What can I do for you boys?
SpongeBob:	 Hello, sir. Would you like to buy a chocolate bar? We need an operation.
Customer:	 Really?
Customer:	 Small world. What's the matter with you guys?
SpongeBob:	  Um, we've got some head trauma and internal bleeding.
Customer:	 Well, some guys have all the luck.
Customer:	 I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms.
Customer:	 At night,  I lay awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.
Customer:	  Oh, no...
Customer:	  Ow...
SpongeBob:	 Come on, Patrick, let's help him!
SpongeBob:	 Careful, put him down gently.
Customer:	  Ow...!
SpongeBob:	 Poor, poor man. Is there anything, anything we can do to help you?
Customer:	 Well, there is one thing... as you can imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars. 
Customer:	 Such nice boys,  it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! HA HA HA!
SpongeBob:	  Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.
SpongeBob:	 Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures.
Patrick:	  I can live with that. 
SpongeBob:	 Let's change our names to Why and Bother.
Tom:	 CHOCOLATE! 
SpongeBob:	 No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...
Patrick:	 No! Don't hurt us, Tom. Please Spare Me! 
Tom:	 Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you...  I'd like to buy all your chocolate. 
SpongeBob:	 Thank you for your patronage.
Patrick:	 Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money.
Patrick:	 But what are we going to spend it on?
Squidward:	  Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.
Server:	 Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party.
Squidward:	 But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restraunt?
Server:	 Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs and their  dates.
SpongeBob:	 So, how long have you two ladies known each other?
Mother:	 What? What did he say?
