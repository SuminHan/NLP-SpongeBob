SpongeBob:	  Gary, the paper's here!  You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section!  I am a happy sponge! 
Gary:	  Meow. 
Patrick:	 I see you got the paper. 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, hey, Patrick.  Well, I'd better get going!
Patrick:	 Yep, see you later. 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 What did you say?
Patrick:	 Well I didn't say anything.
SpongeBob:	 I didn't say anything, either.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 See you later then. 
SpongeBob:	  Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something.
Patrick:	 Ah, but it is you  that is messing with me.  That's what's messing with us!
SpongeBob:	 It's a baby scallop.
Patrick:	  I'll take care of this!
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick! It's totally helpless.  It looks like he can't even fly yet.
Patrick:	 What's the matter, is he stupid?
SpongeBob:	 No, Patrick, he's just a baby.  He's all alone with no one to take care of him.
Patrick:	 Well, we can't just leave him out here.
SpongeBob:	 You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple.  Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in.  There you go. It's the best seat in the house. 
Patrick:	 Let me see!  Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh!  I think somebody's hungry!
SpongeBob:	  Is it true? Are you hungry?
Junior:	  Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!
SpongeBob:	 I've got just the thing.  How would you like a Krabby Patty? 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!
SpongeBob:	 Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty. 
Junior:	  Blech!
SpongeBob:	 Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before. 
Patrick:	  Let's try a donut. 
SpongeBob:	 French fries?
Junior:	  Unh-unh.
Patrick:	  A donut? 
SpongeBob:	  All we have left is this apple! 
Worm:	 Hello sea creatures! I bring you greetings from Apple World! 
SpongeBob:	 Of course, scallops love worms! 
Worm:	 Huh, wait! We will bury you! 
SpongeBob:	 Well, you should be good for the rest of the... 
Patrick:	 What now?
SpongeBob:	 I don't know. Aww, don't cry.
Patrick:	 Do something, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, look at the funny face!  Look at the funny face!
Patrick:	 Wait! I think I might know the problem.  Yep, that's it alright.  Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new. 
SpongeBob:	 How did you know?
Patrick:	 How do you think?  And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.
SpongeBob:	 Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.
Patrick:	 I know, good thing there's two of us.
SpongeBob:	 You know Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.
Patrick:	 Yeah! At least until it's old enough to be on its own! Oh, I wanna be the mom!
SpongeBob:	 I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.
Patrick:	 You're right. If I was a mom......this would be kind of shocking.  Just call me Daddy!
Patrick:	  It sure is cute when it's asleep.
SpongeBob:	  Yeah.  Shh! 
Patrick:	 Hey, SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob:	  Yes, Patrick?
Patrick:	 I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.
SpongeBob:	 Me neither.
Patrick:	 Well, good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Good night, Patrick.  Patrick, breakfast is ready! 
Patrick:	 Alright! All this parenting stuff makes me hungry.  Hey Junior, how are you doing today?  SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Patrick?
Patrick:	 Kid's got a stinky.
SpongeBob:	  Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full. 
Patrick:	  Ahh! Wish I could, but I gotta get going.
SpongeBob:	 Going? Where are you going?
Patrick:	  I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?
SpongeBob:	 You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?
Patrick:	 I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable. 
SpongeBob:	 Ok. 
Patrick:	 Phew, what a day.
SpongeBob:	 Oh great, you're home! Now you can help me with the baby.
Patrick:	 Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to but I'm totally beat from work.
SpongeBob:	 Huh? 
Patrick:	  That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, what about my break?
Patrick:	 Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise.
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, ok, tomorrow.
Narrator:	 Tomorrow... 
Patrick:	 Phew, another tough day! 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break!
Patrick:	 Work was a killer! I need my chair. 
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, I really need my...
Patrick:	 Tomorrow for sure.
Narrator:	 Tomorrow for sure... 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick?
Patrick:	 I'll get to it eventually...
Narrator:	 Eventually... 
SpongeBob:	 Uhhh?
Patrick:	 Uhhh.
Narrator:	 Uhhh... 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick Star, we need to talk.
Patrick:	 Just one more minute, I gotta...
SpongeBob:	 Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man! 
Patrick:	 Hey, I'm missin' the coconut!
SpongeBob:	 You haven't been helping at all with Junior!  We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.
Patrick:	 I changed his diaper!
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, once.
Patrick:	 He's only this big.  How many diapers could he possibly use?
SpongeBob:	  Hmmm?
Patrick:	 Oh, that's not that much.
SpongeBob:	  Hmmm?
Patrick:	  So?
SpongeBob:	  Hmmm?  Hmmm?  Hmmm!? 
Patrick:	  I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh!  I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise! 
SpongeBob:	 So, what's the plan for the day?
Patrick:	 No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal!
SpongeBob:	  Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock.
Patrick:	 Six o'clock.
SpongeBob:	 Six o'clock.
Patrick:	 Six o'clock.
SpongeBob:	  Six o'clock.
Patrick:	  Six o'clock.
SpongeBob:	 Six o'clock.
Patrick:	 Six o'clock. 
Narrator:	 12:00 midnight.
Patrick:	 Oh, that was some party!  Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior. What? What?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, nothing.
Patrick:	 Oh, what a relief.  For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.
SpongeBob:	  Do you remember what you said to me this morning?
Patrick:	 Somethin' about root beer, right?
SpongeBob:	  No.
Patrick:	 Oh wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.
SpongeBob:	 Does...  "You can take the night off, pal!"  ...ring a bell?
Patrick:	  I don't need this. 
SpongeBob:	 What? Where do you think you're going?
Patrick:	  I'm going back to work. 
SpongeBob:	 Work?! 
Patrick:	  He got hit in the head with two coconuts!
SpongeBob:	  So! This is work?
Patrick:	 You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes I gotta move the antenna, sometimes I lose the remote,  and sometimes my butt itches real bad!
SpongeBob:	  Oh, you poor, poor thing! By the way, you forgot your ! 
Patrick:	  Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?
SpongeBob:	  Overtime?!
Patrick:	 Yeah, overtime, pal!
SpongeBob:	  Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!
Patrick:	 You know what that means?
SpongeBob:	 And that's the kind of work you're doing?
Patrick:	 ​It means working when you're just too tired to work!
SpongeBob:	 Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the 
Patrick:	 You just keep going on working and working!
SpongeBob:	 ​You never help! 
Patrick:	  There's that stupid noise again!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window.
Patrick:	  Oh.
Patrick and SpongeBob:	  Junior!
SpongeBob:	 Did you catch him?
Patrick:	  No.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	  We're bad parents! 
SpongeBob:	 Junior? Hey, he's flying!
Patrick:	 I guess he's all grown up!  Hey, what about Daddy?  That's my boy.
SpongeBob:	 Goodbye.
Patrick:	 Goodbye, Junior.
SpongeBob:	 Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore.
Patrick:	 This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.
SpongeBob:	 Despite all we've been through, it was worth it.
Patrick:	 Yeah... Let's have another!
