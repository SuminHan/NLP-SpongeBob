SpongeBob:	 Patrick, remember when we saw the London Eye?
Patrick:	 I think the question is "Did it see us?"
SpongeBob:	 Look, Patrick. Trafalgar Square. Wasn't it beautiful.
Patrick:	 No. The lions are scary.
SpongeBob:	 Those lions won't hurt you Patrick. Why they've been there for hundreds of years.
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, that just means they're hungry. Come on!
SpongeBob:	 Here we are at the famous Abbey Road, where we got a tip that we might meet a walrus. Coo Coo Cachoo! Unfortunately, the walrus never showed up.
Patrick:	 I don't believe in walruses. I just believe in me... and you SpongeBob.
