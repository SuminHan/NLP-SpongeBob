Woman:	  Hey, you stupid bubble, I just washed those!
Old Man Jenkins:	 My spine!
Man:	 Why don't you watch where you're going?!
Nancy:	 Get back here!
Old Man Jenkins:	 I'll sue!
SpongeBob:	  Hey, little bubble. Where'd you come from? Perhaps this letter will shed some light on your origin. It's from my old friend, Bubble Buddy. I wonder what's up with him.  Let's see: Dear, SpongeBob...
Bubble Buddy:	 The Mrs. and I have to go away for a few days, and our regular bubble sitter is sick. Could you please watch our son, Shiny, until we get back? I owe you one! Your pal, Bubble Buddy.
SpongeBob:	 Please keep Shiny away from sharp objects. We don't want him to go pop like his, late Uncle Raymond.  Oh, boy! Gary, did you hear that? They want me to watch little Shiny! I wonder when he's going to show up. The letter doesn't say.  Oh, I can't wait to meet him!  Oh, there you are, Shiny! Oh, look at you! You're just as cute as the dickens!  Upsy-Daisy! Say hello to Shiny, Gary.  You're full of soap and vinegar, aren't you? I can't wait for my friends to meet you!
Squidward:	 
SpongeBob:	 ♪La la la la la la la!♪ This is going to be great, Shiny! Downsy Daffodil. Squidward loves meeting new friends.
Squidward:	 No, I don't! 
SpongeBob:	 You're gonna like Squidward. He's lots of fun.
SpongeBob:	  So, how was your trip?  You don't talk much do you? Hmm. Guess he's not home. Oh, well. We'll have to try again, later.  Hey, Shiny. Where are you going?  You can't go in there! You weren't invited!
Squidward:	 Would you please get your friend out of my house?
Squidward:	 Where is he?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Squidward. This place is so filled with sharp, jagged, broken things! This is no place for a little bubble boy!  There he is! Don't worry, Squidward. I'll get him!  Nope. Jagged glass. Barbed wire. Cactuses. Cactuses protected by barbed wire. Shh! Shiny must be in this one. Gotcha!  No, guess not.  You don't think he p-p-popped in there?
Squidward:	 There he is! He's headed straight for my glass menagerie!
Squidward:	 Phew...
SpongeBob:	 Hold still, Shiny. Gotcha! 
Squidward:	 Of course.
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Shiny. Fun is fun, but it's time to come down, now.  Barnacles!
SpongeBob:	 Shiny, no!
SpongeBob:	 Shiny, come back!  There he is!  He's headed for that open window! 
SpongeBob:	  I gotcha, you little rascal. I guess Shiny wants to be an artist, just like you.
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, I spent 6 long months on that painting!
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Squidward. Shiny's made of soap. We'll just wash it off.  There you go, good as new.  Really catches your inner self. Oh, look at the time. Time to go to work! See you there. Bye! 
SpongeBob:	 Hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Morning, Laddy. Say, what's with the glass puppet?
SpongeBob:	 This isn't glass! Remember Bubble Buddy? Well, I'm taking care of his son.
Mr. Krabs:	 Eh, Bubble Buddy, huh? That guy still owes me money! So, what's the little deadbeat's name?
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, allow me to introduce you to Shiny Bubble.
Mr. Krabs:	  Put it there!  Hey! 
SpongeBob:	 Oh! You might wanna be careful with those sharp claws, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 Come here you little rascal! 
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, I got him! Wow, look how shiny Shiny made you.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, would you look at that. I never felt this clean on a weekday. Why don't you take into the kitchen and let him play with the dirty dishes?
SpongeBob:	 Wow, I think Mr. Krabs really likes you. You play with these while I tend to the grill.  You sure are lucky, Shiny. You get to learn the glories of the service industry.
SpongeBob:	 Yessiree, Shiner. You show me a sizzling grill, and I'll show you a happy customer.
Squidward:	 What in the name of Neptune is going on- 
Customer:	 Money! Yay!
SpongeBob:	 There you are, Shiny. I'm so glad I found you. Good thing you weren't hurt.
Mr. Krabs:	 You better get him out of here if you wanna keep him that way!  Bubbles today. They don't seem to understand the value of money.
SpongeBob:	 That's okay, Shiny. It's too dangerous for you to work at the Krusty Krab, anyway. But, there are some fun, safe things we can do. Like stand in place, or sit in place. Or the "let's do nothing at all" game. Patrick is really good at that one. He-
SpongeBob:	 Shiny? Shiny where are you?
SpongeBob:	 Shiny! No! You can't go to the city. It's too dangerous!  Where are you, Shiny?  Shiny, no! Don't worry. I'll save you!  There now. Safe and sound.  Now, Shiny, I-  Now, Shiny, you might-  That was a close one. Okay, now. Let's get going and keep you away from sharp pointy things.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, tartar sauce. Shiny, no!
SpongeBob:	 "Bikini Bottom Pin Factory"? Don't worry, Shiny. I'm coming!  Shiny, you have to be more careful. You could get popped in a place like that. Hold on. There's something tickling my nose. 
SpongeBob:	 Shiny, where are you going?  "Scissor Works"? Hold on, Shiny!  Oh, boy. Did you know scissors are sharp and dangerous? Luckily, we both escaped unharmed! 
SpongeBob:	 Shiny?  "Pitchfork Pantry." Of course.  Aah. Ow.  Shiny, how many times do I have to tell you? No sharp, no pointy! Now, let's see if there's a safe place for you to visit. Ah! "The Pillow Foundry" That's a safe place to visit. Pillows aren't dangerous.  Huh?
SpongeBob:	 Okay, let's skip the pillow foundry. I'll just take you to my house.
SpongeBob:	 Here we are. Home safe home! You must be famish after all that running around. Now, what would a growing bubble eat? Hmm.  I know! 
SpongeBob:	  Shiny! Don't worry! I'll save you!  Oh, that ain't right!  Oh, come on, man!  Phew, that was close.
SpongeBob:	 Uh oh.
Bubble Buddy:	 Hey, SpongeBob. How's my son been faring?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, he's...  ...doing great.
Bubble Buddy:	 I see you've grown a second head, again, son.
SpongeBob:	 Again?
Bubble Buddy:	 Don't worry, SpongeBob. I'll take care of it.  So, did my son behave himself?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, he was a little angel... in a little devil sort of way.
Bubble Buddy:	 Well, see you later.
SpongeBob:	 Bye, bye. Anytime you need a baby-sitter. In case you wanna know, I do a lot of stuff. I have Gary,... he needs feeding... and I have to check in with Mr. Krabs... and I... stand around a lot, and that keeps me busy.
