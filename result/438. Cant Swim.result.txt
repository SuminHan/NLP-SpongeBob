Plankton:	 What's the matter, man?
Mr. Krabs:	 I can't swim!
Plankton:	 Relax, Eugene, there's nothing wrong as long as we use these inner-tubes!
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, okay. 
Plankton:	 Hold on.
Mr. Krabs:	 Thanks, buddy!
Plankton:	 Anytime, pal. 
Mr. Krabs:	  Hey, I think I'm swimming!
Plankton:	 Actually, that's called standing, but close enough.
