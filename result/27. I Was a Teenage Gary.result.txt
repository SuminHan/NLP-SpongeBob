SpongeBob:	  Exercise time is over, Gary.  We don't want you getting too thin.  Here, boy. Fetch! 
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Huh?   Good job Gary!  I love you Gary!  Gary Gary Gary Gary Gary!  Ha Ha! Down boy! Ha ha! 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
SpongeBob:	 For what?
Patrick:	 The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend!  So, you ready or what?
SpongeBob:	 That was this weekend?  I can't go! I don't have anyone to take care of Gary! 
Squidward:	 Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?
Squidward:	 What's a Gary?
SpongeBob:	 Not a Gary...Gary. He's my pet snail.  Say hello! 
Squidward:	 Yuck. You actually care for that thing?
SpongeBob:	 I love Gary!
Squidward:	 Well, I don't. Get somebody else. 
SpongeBob:	 I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick. 
Squidward:	 Go away?  You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?
SpongeBob:	 Actually, a three day weekend.
Squidward:	 As in, not here for three days?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.
Patrick:	 Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!
Squidward:	 I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.
SpongeBob:	 You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk... 
Squidward:	 Friday, Saturday and Sunday. A three-day weekend.
SpongeBob:	 Let me show you how to feed him.  The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.
Squidward:	 Sure it's enough? 
Group:	 Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Patrick:	 The bus is here! The bus is here!  C'mon, SpongeBob!
Group:	 Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Squidward:	  Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye-bye.
SpongeBob:	 Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?
Squidward:	 I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred.
SpongeBob:	 Gary.
Squidward:	 Right, yeah, right.  Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers!  They're gone! 
Gary:	 Meow.
Squidward:	  This is going to be the best three days of my life.  I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob.  Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me.   The snail! I forgot the snail!  I've got to do something.  Okay, okay ,okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here.  Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat. You've gotta finish this food!
SpongeBob:	 See you later, Patrick.
Squidward:	 Come on, eat! Eat! Eat!  Ohh...
SpongeBob:	  Gary! I'm home!
Squidward:	  Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Squidward! What are you doing here? 
Squidward:	 Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.
SpongeBob:	 What a great friend you are, Squidward.
Squidward:	 So, uhh, well, see you. Good-bye.
SpongeBob:	 Thanks, Squidward.  I can always count on you.  Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward! 
Purple Doctorfish:	 Yes, yes, it's just as I thought.
SpongeBob:	 What?
Purple Doctorfish:	 This is definitely a snail.
SpongeBob:	 I knew it! Oh Squid, did you hear that?
Purple Doctorfish:	 Therefore, a shot of snail plasma must be carefully administered. Here you go. 
SpongeBob:	 Aren't you going to do it?
Purple Doctorfish:	 Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm too squeamish. 
Squidward:	 Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.
SpongeBob:	 Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too.
Squidward:	 Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do... 
SpongeBob:	 Gary!
Squidward:	 Okay, okay, I'll do it. 
SpongeBob:	 Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady.  Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again. 
Squidward:	 Will you hold him still? 
SpongeBob:	 OW! Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.
Squidward:	 Well, you made me do it.
SpongeBob:	 What's going to happen to me?
Squidward:	 Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.
SpongeBob:	 I don't know, I feel kind of funny!
Squidward:	 I'm telling you, its all in your head. 
Squidward:	 He just needed water?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Gary, you're better! 
Squidward:	 Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night.
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!
Squidward:	 Trust me SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine. 
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?
Gary:	  Meow! 
SpongeBob:	 Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.
Gary:	 Meow?
SpongeBob:	 Sorry Gary, I couldn't control myself.  Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?
Gary:	 Meow.
SpongeBob:	 No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I-I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top! 
SpongeBob:	 'Gary, you're getting a  lot faster! 
SpongeBob:	  Look at me. Never better.  I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine! 
SpongeBob:	  Gary... I'm fine! 
SpongeBob:	   Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see.  That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway!
SpongeBob:	  Ha! Now I don't have to buy those new shoes!  I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeeeow!
Squidward:	  I hope I never see another snail again. Good night, Clary.  Who could that be? As if I didn't already know.  SpongeBob, I already told you. You're gonna be just fi-i-i... 
SpongeBob:	 Meow!
Squidward:	 
SpongeBob:	 Meow! Meow. 
Squidward:	 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done?  It's all your fault.  Okay, okay, okay, okay, get it together, Squidward.
SpongeBob:	 Meow!  Meow. Meow.  Meow!  Meow. Meow. 
Squidward:	 None of this would be happening if I'd only fed the snail! 
Squidward:	 Uh-oh!
