Patrick:	 SpongeBob! Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.
SpongeBob:	 Huh?
Sandy:	 Get him! 
Sandy:	 Just as I thought. You're suffering from a condition known as "Earworm." You see, when your brain becomes stuck on a catchy tune, you're spectable with earworm infection and you've got a nasty one there.
Mr. Krabs:	 Let's just rip the little sucker out!
Sandy:	 Hold it! We can't do that. It might damage his brain. The only way to drive the earworm out is with another catchy tune.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I got one! It's an old sea shanty me and me mates used to sing on the high seas. ♪It be drowsy and wet on the mighty high seas, for I need a boat for rapid disease. Oh, mateys. Oh, mateys. Don't ever weep! If I so ever sleep, cast me into the deep!♪  He ain't budgin'.

We need somebody with really musical talent to get rid of this thing.
Squidward:	 Alright. I'll do it. But only because you required an artist of such high talent.
Sandy:	 Oh, right. Squidward. You play that little doohickey.
Squidward:	 It's called a clarinet. 
Sandy:	 You did it! Drove the little critter out!
Patrick:	 Hold still, buddy! 
SpongeBob:	 Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Squidward!
Squidward:	 Alright. You're greatful. Now leave me alone. 
Squidward:	 That was a near little tune I came up with today, if I do say so myself.
Squidward:	 Oh, yeah. That's catchy stuff, Squiddy. Catchy stuff. Mmm-hmm.
