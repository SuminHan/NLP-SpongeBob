SpongeBob:	  [Sings to himself, then addresses Gary] I'm sorry Gary. I thought you were done.'...  Wow. This town is sure going down hill.  Uhh. Mr. Krabs. What are you doing out here.
Mr. Krabs:	 Well... You know... Unwinding. Enjoying the free parking.  What's happening to your little critter here?
SpongeBob:	 I don't know. But when he does that he usually finds change.
Mr. Krabs:	 Change? As in legal tender?
SpongeBob:	 Yeah. Watch. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Wow. Shiver me shell wax. You're like a little money detecting... Uh... You know... A sneagle.
SpongeBob:	 You mean snail.
Mr. Krabs:	 Thank you SpongeBob. How about you bring your sneagle into work with ye.
SpongeBob:	 You said pets were not nothing but disease carrying vermins that should never be brought to the workplace.
Mr. Krabs:	 But that was before I knew that they had such an amazing talent.
SpongeBob:	 But the whole process causes Gary big discomfort. I could never do it to him.
Mr. Krabs:	 I could.
Mr. Krabs:	 There you go. Bring in that change. I've been working on that one for months. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr!
SpongeBob:	 What's so funny, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 Uhh... SpongeBob. Shouldn't you be out back scrubbing the dumpster.

Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah. But you still have work to do.
SpongeBob:	 I do?
Mr. Krabs:	 Yeah. How about you rearrange the wall rivets from smallest to largest.
SpongeBob:	 But aren't they the same size.
Mr. Krabs:	 That's what they want you to know. Now take a long look.

Mr. Krabs:	 Who do you think you are!  JACKPOT! Money, money, money, money. Come to papa.  Oh boy.
Purple Doctorfish:	 Yeah he's in pretty bad shape with the impact of all that metal but he'll pull through.
SpongeBob:	 Doctor? How does this sort of thing happen?
Purple Doctorfish:	 I think this has something to do with it. 
SpongeBob:	 Hey. My Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fridge magnet!
