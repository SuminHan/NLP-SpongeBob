SpongeBob:	  Patrick, with this time machine we can go back to the past and make our young selves wiser.
Patrick:	 That's difficult to imagine, but I'd like to see us try. 
SpongeBob:	 Well, it's never to early to start your education young man! That's why I brought you this.  Order up, little fella.  I'm so proud of him. Okay, your turn, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Naah, I'm good.
