SpongeBob:	  La la la la la.  Missed ya. Uh-oh.  You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over.  The "Ild Ones"! That's a strange name.  Scallop!!  Bye "Ild Ones". I like your silly name. Hmm..."w". Oh, oh, they're not the "Ild Ones". They must be the "Wild Ones".
Fish:	  The Wild Ones?! Tar nation! Don't you know who the Wild Ones are, son?!
SpongeBob:	 No; I don't know who you are, either.
Fish:	 Why, they're the most ferocious, bloodthirsty biker gang under the sea. They've destroyed entire cities in an afternoon! 
SpongeBob:	 Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut!  Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?
SpongeBob:	 There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows. We've got to protect the Krusty Krab. The Krabby Patties must survive!
Mr. Krabs:	 Settle down, son. What are you all riled up about?
SpongeBob:	 Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!
Mr. Krabs:	 What are you going on about? Bikers?
SpongeBob:	 The Wild Ones are coming, Mr. Krabs. They're the most vicious, ravenous herd of hooligans in the sea.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ravenous did you say? That's another word for hungry, isn't it?  Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune.
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, this is serious! 
Mr. Krabs:	 That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course. 
SpongeBob:	 Squidward! 
Squidward:	 Yes, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 A horrible biker gang called the "Wild Ones" are coming. We've got to run, hide! 
Squidward:	  Oh, my. This sounds serious. Luckily, I know just what you should do. Listen closely.
SpongeBob:	 Uh-huh.
Squidward:	 Get a good grip on your pants.  Turn around. 
SpongeBob:	 Like this, Squidward?
Squidward:	 That's it. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick!
Patrick:	 Hello, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 An evil gang of bikers are coming to ravage Bikini Bottom.
Patrick:	 Huh.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, didn't you hear what I said?
Patrick:	 Oh, I heard you. What I didn't hear was a hello.
SpongeBob:	 Hello, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Hello, SpongeBob. Bloodthirsty bikers! We got to hide! 
Giant Clam #2:	 Hey, what happened to you?
Giant Clam #1:	  I... I don't want to talk about it, man. 
Patrick:	  Hide me!
SpongeBob:	  No, hide me!
Patrick:	  Hide me!
SpongeBob:	  Me!
Patrick:	  No, me!
SpongeBob:	  Me!
Patrick:	  Me!
SpongeBob:	  Me!
Patrick:	 No! No more running.
SpongeBob:	 What?
Patrick:	 Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats  and their leather pants 
SpongeBob:	  And their leather socks.
Patrick:	 If we dressed up like that then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads.
SpongeBob:	 Say that again, Patrick.
Patrick:	 Little baby doody-heads?
SpongeBob:	 No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers.  What do you think, Patrick? Do I look though?
Patrick:	 I wouldn't mess with ya.
SpongeBob:	 Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride.  Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here.
Harold:	 Ooh, I feel protected now.
Scooter:	 Those are some mean looking rides, dudes. 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, it's working. They think we're...vicious bikers.  Bikini Bottom, you're salvation is here.
Patrick:	  See?
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, that's your salivation.
Patrick:	 Oh.
SpongeBob:	 So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?
Squidward:	 Does that part include laughing at you? Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual.
SpongeBob:	 Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?
Patrick:	 I'm bloodthirsty. See?  Want some?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood.  See Squidward? We walk the walk but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?
Squidward:	 No, I don't.
Patrick:	 What about our biker club?
Squidward:	 No.
SpongeBob:	 How about our biker organization?
Squidward:	 No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, outfits, or your fellowships.
SpongeBob:	 What about our coalition?
Patrick:	 Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive.
SpongeBob:	  We'll just put you down as undecided.  Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone.
Mr. Krabs:	 This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again.
SpongeBob:	 Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs:	 You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish.
SpongeBob:	 Then can we save the town?
Squidward:	 Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react?  Squidward! We're out of napkins!  Out of napkins!  Squidward! I accidentally removed the "Do No Remove by Penalty of Law" tag on my mattress! Hide me. Hide me.  Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind.  Oh. Thanks, Squidward. 
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. One of your many annoying traits.
SpongeBob:	  Me? Annoying?  Yeah right.
Squidward:	 You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way.  What was that?
Mr. Krabs:	 Ahoy there, mateys. Motorcycle vehicles headed over the horizon.
Squidward:	 What?  Gimme that.  Don't just stand there, save us.
SpongeBob:	 Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as do it together.  Patrick? Patrick!  Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we...
Squidward:	 Panic! Run for your lives!  The Wild Ones are coming! 
Lenny:	 The Wild Ones?  Mable, get the kids! 
Charlie:	 Honey, I got the napkins. Oh, what I have missed this time?
Squidward:	  Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket.  I want to ride to live and live to ride.  I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live.
Biker #1:	 What's that, missy?
Biker #2:	 What?
Biker #1:	 Howdy, we're the "Mild Ones".
SpongeBob:	 Mild Ones?  Oh!
Biker #1:	 Gimme back my M. Let's go, boys.
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't you want to spend any money?
Biker #1:	 Don't you want to kiss the seat of my pants? Let's ride. 
SpongeBob:	 Good-bye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward?
Squidward:	 Woo-hoo-hoo!  Ride to live and live to ride!
