Mrs. Puff:	 Look out! Oh!
Driver 1:	 Learn how to drive!
SpongeBob:	 I'm trying!
Mrs. Puff:	 Calm down, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Yes, Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob:	 Nothing soothes one's frazzled nerves like blowing bubbles! 
Mrs. Puff:	 No blowing bubbles while driving!
Mrs. Puff:	 Phew! 
Driver 2:	 I can't feel my big toe.
SpongeBob:	 So, uh, how'd I do?
Mrs. Puff:	  Get out! You're never getting a boating license!
SpongeBob:	  But—but—
Mrs. Puff:	 Never! Never!
SpongeBob:	 I'll never pass my driver's test, I'll never get my license, and I'll never know the joys of boat ownership!
Nancy Suzy Fish:	 Ooh...
Tina Fran:	 It's really nice.
Larry:	 Oh, yeah, it's a turbo jet. 390 sea horse power with 11-to-1 pop-up piston.  We're talking some serious muscle!
Tina Fran:	 I love your boat, Larry! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, hey there, boyo! Lovely day for a boat wash!  Isn't it?
Mr. Krabs:	 Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Patrick, you want to hang out?
Patrick:	 Wish I could, SpongeBob, but I'm kind of busy spending time with my boat right now.
SpongeBob:	 Your boat.  Sure, Patrick. See you later. 
Patrick:	 Catch! 
Bubble Mrs. Puff:	 You're a very good driver, SpongeBob, and my favorite student. Here's your license.
SpongeBob:	 Ooh!  Aww! If only I was as good at driving as I am at blowing bubbles.  Oh! That's it!
Abigail Marge:	 Whoa!
Tom:	 What is that?
Girls:	 Oh!
SpongeBob:	 All right, all right.
SpongeBob:	 Pleasant day for a drive, hey, Officer?
Motorcycle Cop:	 Sir, I'm going to need to see your license for that, um...
SpongeBob:	  You don't need a license to drive a bubble.
Motorcycle Cop:	 Hmm, I suppose you're right. Carry on, citizen.
SpongeBob:	 Gary!
Gary:	 
SpongeBob:	 You'll never believe it! I was out driving all day! Yes, driving! First, I drove down the street like this!
SpongeBob:	 Then I made a right turn on red like this.
SpongeBob:	 You should've been there, Gary! Oh, it was like a dream come true!
Gary:	  Meow.
SpongeBob:	 Hmm?
Green Fish:	 I'm here for a bubble boat.
Martin:	 Uh, yeah, me too!
Dave:	 I want one!
Various people:	 Uh, yeah, yeah, me too! Yes, please. One, please.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, I'm not sure I have enough soap to make this many bubble boats.
Green Fish:	 Please?
SpongeBob:	 Well, I suppose I could tap into my rainy day reserves.
SpongeBob:	 One bubble boat coming right up!
Green Fish:	 Thank you!
Plankton:	 Down here, idiot! I want to strike fear in the hearts of other drivers. You got something terrifying in that wand for me, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 I sure do, Plankton!
Plankton:	 Oof!
Plankton:	 Ha-ha-ha, you fool! Now I will rule the streets! 
Plankton:	 Ouch!
Plankton:	 Strike fear...
Larry:	 Hmm...blow me something that screams Larry, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 I'm on it, Larry!
Larry:	 Now, this is what I call a muscle car!
Tina Fran:	 I love your boat, Larry!
SpongeBob:	  I'll never blow enough bubble boats at this rate. Yahoo! 
Mrs. Puff:	  Greetings, class. My name is—
Mrs. Puff:	  Mrs. Puff. Oh, now that everyone's driving bubbles, they don't need licenses.  I guess there's just no place in this world for an old driving instructor.
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh! Bah!
Fred:	 Hey, watch it, lady!
Mrs. Puff:	 Ah!
Tom:	 I'm driving over here!
Mable:	 Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh—wah!
Clay:	 Hey! Pick a lane, butter-brain!
Motorcycle Cop:	 I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the boat, ma'am. Do you know why I pulled you over?
Mrs. Puff:	 You ran my plates and saw my rap sheet?
Motorcycle Cop:	 What? No. Your vehicle has been outlawed, ma'am.
Motorcycle Cop:	 Now that everyone drives bubble boats, real boats have been deemed too sharp and pointy to be street legal. 
Mrs. Puff:	 But I've never driven a bubble!
Mrs. Puff:	 Bubble boating school?
Mrs. Puff:	 Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob. Please don't be SpongeBob.  Please don't be SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Hi, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff:	 Of course.
SpongeBob:	 You must be here for the bubble lessons. Don't worry, Mrs. P.  You'll be learning from a master.
SpongeBob:	 Whoa! 
Mrs. Puff:	 Great.
SpongeBob:	 Now, to get your bubble going, just pump your legs like this.
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh! Ooh! Oh!
SpongeBob:	 Nice start.
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh! Fire!
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh! Ah! Hmm. Hah. Eeh.
Mrs. Puff:	 I did it.
SpongeBob:	 Mrs. Puff, you're ready.
Mrs. Puff:	 Really?
SpongeBob:	 Absolutely! You just need to pass your final test...out there. 
Mrs. Puff:	  Oh.
SpongeBob:	 Nice and easy. Doing great.
Harold:	 Hello!
Mrs. Puff:	 You know, this whole bubble boating thing isn't so bad.  Maybe I could—
SpongeBob:	 Oh, no, Mrs. Puff! You got on the freeway by mistake! Look out!
SpongeBob:	 It's okay! Just calm down!
Mrs. Puff:	 Eeh! Oh!
Mrs. Puff:	 Ah!
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh!
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh! 
SpongeBob:	 Ah!
SpongeBob:	 Oh no. What's gonna happen when they hit the surface?
SpongeBob:	 Doh!
Mrs. Puff:	  No more bubbles. Get them off me!
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. Even though it was bubbles that caused all these problems, it was also bubbles that solved 'em. That's kind of a wash, I guess. Get it? Wash? Soap? Bubbles? 
Motorcycle Cop:	  Give me that! Bubble boats are too unstable. They've been declared illegal. Everyone back to your regular boats! 
SpongeBob:	 Well, Mrs. Puff, looks like I have to get my boating license after all. See you tomorrow in class! ♪La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la♪
Mrs. Puff:	  Oh, joy.
