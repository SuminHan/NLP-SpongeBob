TV Announcer:	 The Aquaphone! The Mermalair's telecommunication device connecting City Hall with the underwater crime-fighting hero, Mermaid Man!
SpongeBob:	 Hello?
TV Announcer:	 Never mind. It's just this idiot.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 By the power of Neptune, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy unite!
SpongeBob:	 To the Invisible Boatmobile!
Patrick:	 Yay!
SpongeBob:	 This must be the secret lair of an evil villain!
Patrick:	 You're right!
SpongeBob:	 Looks like there's evil afoot!
TV Announcer:	 Pun!
SpongeBob:	  And littering is a crime.
Squidward:	 What? I thought I had my house sponge and star proofed!
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Squidward. Wanna play  with us?
Squidward:	 NO! Now please fall and get seriously hurt!
SpongeBob:	 I'm sure I've heard that "no" before.
Patrick:	 Only something, Mermaid Man! You can't mean...
SpongeBob:	 Yes, my young pink ward. It's none other than...
SpongeBob:	 Doctor Negative!
Squidward:	  ♪I hate SpongeBob and I hate Patrick...♪
SpongeBob:	 It's that denying desperado's siren song!
Squidward:	 ♪Loathing SpongeBob. Scorning Patrick. La, la, la, la, la, la.♪
SpongeBob:	 He's obviously raising an army of mutant vegetables. And that song he's singing will...
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Bring them to life!
TV Announcer:	 Carrot chop!
TV Announcer:	 Potato pow!
TV Announcer:	 Lettuce laceration!
SpongeBob:	 Although our foes were evil, their nutrition did not go to waste, Doctor Negative.
Patrick:	 We're watching you!
Squidward:	 That's it! I'm gonna clobber you two!
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Squidward, do you hear that? You'd better hurry up or you'll be late for work.
Patrick:	  Yeah. You'd better do something or whatever.
Patrick:	 ♪Mermaid Man, our hero! Barnacle Boy, you too!♪
SpongeBob:	  ♪Mermaid Man, crime-fighter! Barnacle Boy, makes new!♪
Patrick:	 ♪Evil found its match today! Underwater justice and fair play!♪
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 ♪Super plan! Garbage can! Mini van! Mermaid Man!♪
Squidward:	 Will you two shut up about that stupid show?!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, did you say something negative, Doctor Negative?
Squidward:	 What the? How did...
Patrick:	 I heard him say something negative!
Patrick:	 Mermaid Man, that injured victim's bandages have come undone!
SpongeBob:	 That poor man needs aid!
SpongeBob:	 Of the first variety.
SpongeBob:	 Oh! We've forgot the peroxide.
SpongeBob:	 That should hold you until your surgeons can amputate our torso.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Justice restored!
Squidward:	 Hey, Superdorks! Your turn to take out the garbage.
SpongeBob:	 Alright, Doctor Negative. We'll play along and take it out. Hiya!
TV Announcer:	 Junk jab!
TV Announcer:	 Trash thwap!
TV Announcer:	 Putrid pop!
Mr. Krabs:	  Why are all my tables empty? Why am I not makin' money?
Squidward:	 Because these two costume creeps chased them out.
Mr. Krabs:	 Hello?  Mr. Squidward, step into me office.
SpongeBob:	 Uh-oh, Patrick. I think we got Squidward in trouble.
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm gonna share a secret with you that I never told anyone.
Squidward:	 Uh, that's okay. I don't need to hear. Uh...
Squidward:	 Hmm?
Squidward:	  You're a comic book geek!
Mr. Krabs:	 Don't touch those! They're mint condition! Worth a fortune!
Squidward:	 So you read comics. Don't worry. Lots of perfectly immature adults read comics.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, it's deeper than that.
Mr. Krabs:	 I sold it meself. It's Captain Tightwad from Issue 53! They say he's a bad guy, but, you know, I think he's just misunderstood.
Squidward:	 Oh, look at that. I think I've left my oven on.
Mr. Krabs:	 I have some fabric leftover. So, I made this.
Squidward:	 Oh, don't tell me. Doctor Negative?
Mr. Krabs:	 Ahoy, you high-sea halfwits!
Mr. Krabs:	 Tremble before Captain Tightwad!
Mr. Krabs:	 Squidward!
Squidward:	  And cower in fear of Doctor Negative.
SpongeBob:	 Holy Shrimp! This is the best day of my life!
Mr. Krabs:	 What are you waiting for?
TV Announcer:	 Sad!
TV Announcer:	 Pathetic!
TV Announcer:	 Mediocre!
TV Announcer:	 Sub-par!
SpongeBob:	 Why are we fighting Captain Tightwad? He didn't even commit a crime.
Mr. Krabs:	 Wha... What do ya mean?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Mr. Krabs. It's right here in Mermaid Man Number 98. "No superhero shall fight a super villain until that super villain has committed a crime."
Mr. Krabs:	 Arr... Uh... Hey!
Mr. Krabs:	 Ha! See? I just stole some money!
SpongeBob:	 Well, it's not really stealing if it's your own money.
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, come on! What do... What do I have to do here?
Mr. Krabs:	 Are you sure about this? Isn't robbing a bank against the law?
SpongeBob:	 Well, yes Mr. Krabs. But you're not really robbing a bank, you're just pretending to.
Mr. Krabs:	 And then we can play?
SpongeBob:	 Yep!
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, okay.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ahoy! Anyone home? It's Captain Tightwad and Doctor Negative! We're here to rob ya! Anyone here? No.
Security Guard:	 Eh, barnacle nickels! Uh, can I help you ladies?
Mr. Krabs:	 Oh, yeah! Thanks old timer! Um, we're pretending to rob this bank. Where's the tellers? Where's the money?
Security Guard:	 There ain't no tellers. ATM's outside.
Mr. Krabs:	 Ah, barnacles! I've forgot me debit card.
Security Guard:	 Wait a minute! I don't care if you are ladies! Nobody pretends to rob my bank!
SpongeBob:	 Whoa! You were so convincing! You had that guard totally fooled! I think we should skip to the end of the story. Let's just stop here and pick up some props for your evil lair. We'll just need a few dollars.
SpongeBob:	 Boink!
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm supposed to be the villain, but why do I feel like I'm being robbed?
TV Announcer:	 One hour later...
SpongeBob:	 Okay, Captain Tightwad! Doctor Negative, you can come out now!
SpongeBob:	 Okay, so here's the scene. You two have us here in this cage over a pool of boiling oil. Now that is a crime. Now, you can let us out so we can fight.
Squidward:	 Oh, I don't think we're going to do that.
SpongeBob:	 Hey, wha... what are you doing?
Squidward:	 Being evil. Isn't that what you wanted? Aren't you scared? Boo-hoo?
SpongeBob:	 Boo-hoo? Do you expect us to cry?
Squidward:	 No, Mr. Bob. I expect you to fry!
Mr. Krabs:	 Eh, okay, Squidward. Playtime's over. This is getting a little intense here.
Squidward:	 Too long have I suffered living between you two ninnies! But now, now as Doctor Negative, I shall finally exact my exquisite revenge! 
SpongeBob:	 See? I just knew we'd make a terrific bad guy. He is really committing.
Patrick:	 You did a great job with casting.
TV Announcer:	 Could this be the end of our doofus duo? Deep fried like two tenacious tater tots on tenterhooks?
SpongeBob:	 Swing, Boy Yonder! Swing the basket!
SpongeBob:	 Oh boy, Mr. Krabs! That was the best Mermaid Man playdate ever!
Patrick:	 Yeah. Not bad. But next time, we won't go so easy on ya!
Mr. Krabs:	  Maybe I'll just stick to reading comics from now on.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 To the Mermalair!
TV Announcer:	 And so ends another numb-skulled episode of the preposterous pair, Mermaid Pants and Barnacle Star! Tune in next time for more mind-running adventures! I've really gotta find another job! I wonder if it's too late to go back to college radio!
