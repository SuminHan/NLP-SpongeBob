Squidward:	 There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go. 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 
SpongeBob:	 Wey, wook. It's Widward!
Squidward:	 What?
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 
SpongeBob:	 Widward's woing to work.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 
Squidward:	 
Patrick:	 Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 
Squidward:	 What's that supposed to beâ€” some kind of stupid secret code?
SpongeBob:	 We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.
Squidward:	 Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron?  Moron...  as a requirement. 
SpongeBob:	 Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!
Squidward:	 Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!
Patrick:	  What did he say?
SpongeBob:	 I don't know. Something about his nose?
Patrick:	  Squidward, you and your nose will definitely not fit in!
Squidward:	 Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in?  Why, you should be begging me to join!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!
Squidward:	 Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!
Patrick:	 That's what we've been trying to tell you!
SpongeBob:	 We've been stuck up here for three days.
Patrick:	 We told you you wouldn't fit in.
Squidward:	 
SpongeBob:	 Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?
Patrick:	 Ready!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	  Welcome to our club! Welcome to our club! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squid...!
Squidward:	 Shut your half-wit pieholes!  I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club! 
Nancy:	 Whoa!
Frank:	 Make a wish, honey.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again! 
Squidward:	 Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!
Patrick:	 What happened?
Squidward:	 Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!
Squidward:	 Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery? Why-y-y-y?!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, cheer up, Squid. It could be worse.
Patrick:	 Yeah. You could be bald and have a big nose.
Squidward:	 Well... this is the end. 
SpongeBob:	 No, it's not, Squidward.
Patrick:	  It's not?
SpongeBob:	 Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine!  As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 
SpongeBob:	 And besides, we have 
Squidward:	 What's that?
Patrick:	 Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!
SpongeBob:	 Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married? 
Magic Conch:	 Maybe someday.
SpongeBob and Patrick:	  Oooohhhh!
Squidward:	 You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?
SpongeBob:	  Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.
Patrick:	 The shell knows all!
SpongeBob:	 Oh, Magic Conch Shell, what do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?
Magic Conch:	 Nothing.
Patrick:	 The shell has spoken!
Squidward:	 Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!
Squidward:	  I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!
Squidward:	  All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity!  But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns...  sad...  clowns.  What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost!  Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here!  Huh?  I'm  Take that, SpongeBob and Patrick!  Huh? Ohhh...  there's no way out of here.  How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight?  Ah...  Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days.  How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any.  And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell!  If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam...  that tells you nothing! As if the answers to solve all your problems will fall right out of the sky!  Fall right out of the sky! 
Scooter:	 Dude, we're falling right out the sky! We gotta drop the load! 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 Praise the Magic Conch! 
Squidward:	 Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.
SpongeBob:	 It's a gift from the Magic Conch.
Squidward:	 Everything sure looks delicious.  Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite!  Uh, hey, uh,  SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um...  
SpongeBob:	 Squidward?
Squidward:	 Umm...uh..yeah?
SpongeBob:	 Once a member, always a member!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	  To the club! 
Squidward:	 Yeah.  Now, uh, if you'll excuse me...  All right... What shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?
SpongeBob:	 Why don't you ask... the Magic Conch, Squidward?
Squidward:	 Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.
SpongeBob:	  Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.
Patrick:	  Maybe he's not a brother.
Squidward:	  Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic.  Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?
Magic Conch:	 Neither.
Squidward:	 Oh. Then how about the soup?
Magic Conch:	 I don't think so.
Squidward:	 Could I have anything to eat?
Magic Conch:	 No.
Squidward:	 No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!
Patrick:	  Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Magic Conch:	 No.
Patrick:	 Hmm... Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?
Magic Conch:	 Yes.
Patrick:	 All right!  Sorry, Squidward.
Squidward:	 Give me that!  Can I have something to eat?
Magic Conch:	 No.
Squidward:	 Can I have something to eat?
Magic Conch:	 No.
Squidward:	 Can I have something to eat?
Magic Conch:	 No.
Squidward:	 Can't you say anything else but no?
Magic Conch:	 Try asking again.
Squidward:	 Can I have something to eat?
Magic Conch:	  No!
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, are you all right?
Patrick:	 Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.
Kelp Forest Ranger:	 Hello? Anyone there? Hello? Hello?!  Do you folks need some help?
Squidward:	  I'm   You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!
Kelp Forest Ranger:	 Magic... Conch Shell?  You mean like this?! 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 The Magic Conch! A club member!
Kelp Forest Ranger:	 
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 
Squidward:	  Abra.
Kelp Forest Ranger:	 My conch told me to come save you guys.
SpongeBob, Patrick and Kelp Forest Ranger:	 Hooray for the magic conches!
Kelp Forest Ranger:	 All right, Magic Conch... what do we do now?
Magic Conch:	 Nothing.
SpongeBob, Patrick, and Kelp Forest Ranger:	 All hail the Magic Conch! 
Squidward:	 All hail the magic conch!
