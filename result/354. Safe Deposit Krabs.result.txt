SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs, I'm done watering down the ketchup. Do you want me to... Mr. Krabs? Mr. Krabs? MR. KRABS!
Squidward:	 Would you pipe down!?
SpongeBob:	 Sorry, Squidward! I can't find Mr. Krabs and he said he'd be right back! I'm getting a little concerned...
Squidward:	 That's nice...and...interesting...
SpongeBob:	 I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna go look for him!  Hold on, Krabs! I'm coming for ya!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Well, time to head home!  Whoo hoo! I hope to see each and every one of ya on the outside!  Balmy! I'm locked in!  I guess I'm trapped here all night!  With all of this moolah! Such much moolah...  I have no one to tell about it! Time to russel up me some friends!
SpongeBob:	  Oh, hi Pearl! Is Mr. Krabs here?
Pearl:	 No.
SpongeBob:	 Pearl, I hate to be the one to tell you this but Mr. Krabs is missing!
Pearl:	  Oh my gosh.
SpongeBob:	 I know!
Pearl:	 Oh, my, gosh.
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry! I'll find him!
Pearl:	  Oh my gosh!  Call him on my cell! 
Mr. Krabs:	 You look absolutely stunning tonight, Mrs. Greenback. Waiter!  Oui, oui, monsieur, what can I get you and zee lady tonight?  The lady would like to start with a million clams. A side of investments, and hold the taxes. I'll have the same. But with extra no taxes. Eh. Such a friendly fella. Good lookin' too. I'm almost gonna regret not giving him a tip.  Hello?
SpongeBob:	 Mr. Krabs? Are you okay?
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm fine boy! In fact, I'm dancing with a beautiful lady.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, that's nice.
Mr. Krabs:	 Yes, and she's made entirely out of money.
SpongeBob:	 What? Where are you?
Mr. Krabs:	 I'm locked in the bank vault, and having the time of me life. Oh, and I think I'm running out of oxygen, and it's making me lose me mind.
SpongeBob:	 I gotta save Mr. Krabs!  Patrick! Patrick, you gotta help me, buddy! I need to break into a bank! 
Patrick:	 What?! SpongeBob SquarePants, we have been friends for a long time, and you've asked me to do some crazy things over the years. Breaking into a bank?  Has to be the coolest!
Mr. Krabs:	  Ah. This is the life.  Sun, sand, and surf. And of course. Mrs. Greenback by my side. What's that? Eh, don't start on me now. I'm sure this remote island has a food source! Krabs just hasn't found it yet, that's all. I'll just… eh. Heh heh. So hungry.
SpongeBob:	  Coast is clear! What's the plan, buddy?
Patrick:	 Okay. First we climb up the walls.  Then, we slide down the chimney and eat up all the milk and cookies they left out for us!
SpongeBob:	 Well, I don't see a chimney. But we could try getting in through a roof vent. If only we had a way to scale this wall.
Patrick:	 Luckily, I brought the bank breaking kit! Um. How about this? 
SpongeBob:	 A bunch of old shoelaces?
Patrick:	 It's as close as I'll ever get to having shoes.
SpongeBob:	 I wish we had something stronger. But this'll have to do. 
Patrick:	 Hey, SpongeBob! I got an idea! Let's use this grappling hook! 
SpongeBob:	 This vent will surely lead us to Mr. Krabs!
Patrick:	 Let's get him!  COOL! Let's do that again!
SpongeBob:	 Not now, Patrick. We're running out of time. And more importantly, Mr. Krabs is running out of oxygen.
Mr. Krabs:	  Ohhh! So hungry!  Oh, why did I come to this uninhabitable island? Why did I do it? Why did I say all that to Mrs. Greenback? I miss her… why isn't she? Miss Greenback! Where could she be? What have I done?  Ms. Greenback! Oh, Ms. Greenback.  You're okay! I was so worried.  What's this?!! Ah! Little miss! What the Neptune?!!  A slimy money dragon! You're not sucking away me fortune without a fight!  Gimme back Mrs. Greenback you beast!
SpongeBob:	  Patrick, you ready?
Patrick:	 This lock won't know what hit it! 
SpongeBob:	 Ah, careful Patrick. Use finesse.
Patrick:	 Oh, right!  I'll use the finesse. 
Bank Manager:	 Good morning, gentlemen. 
Patrick:	 We've been rumbled! Run! Scatter! Scamper! Save yourself!
Bank Manager:	 What's all this about?  May I help you with anything, sir?
SpongeBob:	 Ah. Yes, I need to make a withdrawal. I need to withdraw one Mister Krabs!
Bank Manager:	 I assure you, Mr. SquarePants, we've received no such deposit. 
Mr. Krabs:	 I got you now, money sucker! That is it, you nimbrid! It's you, or me now! Just you and me!  I concurred the money dragon! It's history! Woo hoo!
Bank Manger:	 Security!  And don't forget your… eh… deposit. 
Mr. Krabs:	 You know, boyo. Through this whole ordeal, I've learned a little something about greed. A little something about isolation. Heh. Even a little something about love. And you know what I realized through it all?
SpongeBob:	 That you can't put a price on freedom?
Mr. Krabs:	 Barnacles no, boy! I realized that they didn't pay interest on me deposit!  Hey, you cheapskates! Gimme me interest!  Well. What do you know? I doubled me money.
