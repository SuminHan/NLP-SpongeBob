Mr. Krabs:	 Okay, everybody settle down. Welcome  to the Komedy Krab!  Now please give a warm welcome to our first comic, the indiscernible Dougie Williams. 
Dougie Williams:	 Good evening, folks. I'm going to skip the jokes and get right to the part where I throw pies at you. 
SpongeBob:	  I hope I do as good as that guy.
Dougie Williams:	  Man, those people will laugh at anything. Hey, don't sweat it kid, I got them all worked up for you.
Mr. Krabs:	 Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants. 
Sandy:	 Go get 'em, SpongeBob!
Patrick:	  Whoo-hoo! 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, hey, hey ladies and jellyfish, have you ever noticed salt shakers? I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go? Huh? You know what I mean?
SpongeBob:	 And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things?  I mean, you chop them up into slices, but...  What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup? 
Fred:	 Oh, brother, this guy stinks!
Harold:	 Hey, hey funny guy! I've got a joke for you! What smells rotten and puts people to sleep?
SpongeBob:	 Umm, noxious gas?
Harold:	 No! Your act! 
SpongeBob:	 Did you ever notice how, uhh...  ...forks, uhh...
Fred:	 Forks?! Come on! 
SpongeBob:	  Quick, SpongeBob, make a witty observation!  Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are? 
Fish:	 That's true.
Sandy:	 Huh?
SpongeBob:	 I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things.  And what's up with all that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home too. 
Patrick:	  Squirrel fur!
SpongeBob:	 And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt.  Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?
Harold:	 Why?
SpongeBob:	 Because, they're so darn stupid! 
Patrick:	 That's a good one, huh, Sandy?
Sandy:	 Uhh, y-yeah... 
Mr. Krabs:	 That was fantastic, boy. You really knocked them out! I think I'll do this joke night thing again with you as the head-liner!
SpongeBob:	 I never thought I could be a head-liner! Whatever that is.
Mr. Krabs:	 The headliner's the one who cleans up after the show. 
SpongeBob:	 At least I don't have to clean up my act! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Stick with the squirrel jokes, boy. Now get busy. 
SpongeBob:	 Mops, mops, mops, what's up with those things? I mean, really.  Oh hey, Sandy!
Sandy:	 Howdy, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Did you enjoy the show?
Sandy:	 Well, ac-actually SpongeBob, n-no. Those jokes are hurtful and you know it.
SpongeBob:	 Come on Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom.
Sandy:	 Well, I can't argue with that.
SpongeBob:	 We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time! 
 Sandy:	 You're right, SpongeBob. I was being a little too sensitive.  No hard feelings.  Okay, deodorant. Huh, let's see. Roll-on or stick? 
Fred:	 I think she should buy both. 
Sandy:	 Huh?
Scooter:	 Hey look guys!  It's the stupid squirrel!
Lloyd:	 I know, let's try to communicate with it.
All:	 Duh... 
Sandy:	 Hmph!  Hello, little critter! What's your name?
Mable:	  Don't stand too close to a squirrel, Billy. You'll catch its stupid. 
Billy:	 Okay, mom.
Sandy:	 Stupidity isn't a virus, but it sure is spreading like it. 
SpongeBob:	 La-la-la-la-la-la. Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel. Because they're stupid. Because they're stupid.
Sandy:	 Hey, uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, hi, Sandy.
Sandy:	 Umm, I need to talk to you about them squirrel jokes.
SpongeBob:	 We already talked about that, remember? 
Sandy:	 SpongeBob, this is serious. Since you've been telling them jokes, people have been treating me different. 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob, five minutes.  Hel-lo... Sandy. Me Patrick. Do you un-der-stand?  Squirrels. 
Sandy:	 Y-y-you see? That's what I'm talking about!
SpongeBob:	 Ah, that's just Patrick. He's just fooling around.
Sandy:	 I'm just asking you as a friend, please lay off them squirrel jokes, OK? Tell some of them other jokes you got.
SpongeBob:	  Other jokes?  Bah! I got a million of them.
Sandy:	  Thanks SpongeBob, I knew you'd understand. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants. 
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, hi.  Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish.  I guess you heard that one.
Sandy:	 I haven't heard it! Good one, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob:	 Thank you, you're too kind. Hey, what about this water! I mean, the stuff's everywhere.
Patrick:	 Tell the one about the squirrel and the light bulbs.
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, hey, what about this thing!  Huh? Huh?
Fish #5:	 Get on with the squirrel jokes! 
SpongeBob:	  What do I do? Who do I do? SpongeBob, you've got a choice to make:  your friends  or your career.
SpongeBob:	 Howdy, y'all!  How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb?
All:	 Because they're so darn stupid!
SpongeBob:	  My people!  But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy.  Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes.  Am I right?  Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you! Do you understand now, Sandy? Huh, do you?
Sandy:	  I understand everything that's going on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Great. I knew sooner or later you'd get it. What a great sport.  Let's give a big hand for Sandy! But clap slow, because remember... She's a squirrel!  Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night!  Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob.  Oh, what's this, a fan letter? 
Sandy:	  You were right SpongeBob! Those jokes are funny! Come on over to the Treedome tomorrow and celebrate, Sandy.
SpongeBob:	 You did it SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends.  I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy.  Good morning, Sandy.
Sandy:	 Well, hoooow-deeeeeee!
SpongeBob:	 Sandy, are you feeling alright?
Sandy:	 I'm just being my own au-naturally squirrelly self!  Well come on in! Y'all must be tired from telling them funny jokes all the time. Why don't you take a load off! 
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat.
Sandy:	 Naw,  I just done put glue on it so you wouldn't fall off.  Are them flowers for me? You even done got me a vase! 
SpongeBob:	 But Sandy, that, that's not a... 
Sandy:	 Ain't that purdy?
SpongeBob:	  Sandy, I need wa...
Sandy:	 Oh, that's right. Youse a sea critter. Now what was that thing that sea critters need? Umm, uhh... let's see, uhh...  Sea critters need, uhh...
SpongeBob:	 Wa...
Sandy:	 Oh wait, don't tell me. I know this one!
SpongeBob:	 Wa...
Sandy:	 Wa...llet? Watch? Waffles?
SpongeBob:	  Sandy! Water!
Sandy:	 Well, why didn't you just say so!  Yup, a squirrel sure is stupid. 
SpongeBob:	 Sandy!
Sandy:	 Dumb, dumb, dumb, squirrels is dumb.
SpongeBob:	 Sandy! Ok Sandy, I get it!
Sandy:	 What's that? You want more?  Okey-dokey! More water for the sea-critter! 
SpongeBob:	 Ok Sandy, Ok! I get it!  No more squirrel jokes.  Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel.  And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb.'  But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge!  I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae!  Look at me! I got no bones!
Fish #6:	 That's true. 
SpongeBob:	 Crabs? Oh brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!
Mr. Krabs:	  It's true, I am cheap!
SpongeBob:	 Now let me tell you about those fish? Boy are they smelly. Whoo-hoo! I mean how can a creature that spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really!  Soap... soap... what is... soap?  And don't even get me started on starfish!
