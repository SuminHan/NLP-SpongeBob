Tina-Fran:	 Squidward, we love you!
Audience Member #2:	 I love you, Squidward. You're my favorite! 
Squidward:	 Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous.  Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow. 
SpongeBob:	 Time for another glorious day at work.  Good morning, Squidward!  And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work?
Squidward:	 I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob.
SpongeBob:	 See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidward. Hey, Sandy, what's this?
Sandy:	 Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye.
SpongeBob:	 Ooh, that sounds fancy.
Sandy:	 Let me show you how it works. 
SpongeBob:	 Whoa!  Where'd it go?
Sandy:	 Just where you think it would be. 
Mrs. Puff:	 Oh!
SpongeBob:	 Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab?
Sandy:	 I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob:	 Whoo-hoo! 
Sandy:	 Hold on tight.
SpongeBob:	  Gee, Sandy, this sure feels...
Squidward:	  Well, here we go again. 
SpongeBob:	 Hey, Squidward! 
Sandy:	 What's going on with this thing?  What in tarnation? 
SpongeBob:	 Hi, Sandy.
Squidward:	 I'm not sure what it is but I something seems different about me.
SpongeBob:	 Yeah, me too.
Squidward:	 Hey, what are you doing with my hand? What am I doing with your hand? Ahh! What is this? We're all mixed up together.  This is horrible. I have my clarinet recital tomorrow.
SpongeBob:	 Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever.
Squidward:	  Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated.
Sandy:	 Well, I wish I knew how.
Squidward:	 Well, you have to do something. I can't stay stuck to him.
Sandy:	 Hmmm, I wonder what would happen if I tried zapping you back in the transporter.
Squidward:	 Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it.
Sandy:	 Well, here goes nothing. 
Mable:	 All right, children. Today's Timmy's birthday. You know what that means. Ready Timmy? 
Doctor:	 Congratulations, Mrs. Smith. You gave birth to a healthy baby boy.
Mrs. Smith:	 May I see my baby?
Doctor:	 Of course. 
One-Eyed Monster:	 I've been in love with you ever since I first laid my eye on you.  Hey baby, what's your name? 
Squidward:	 It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same.
Sandy:	 Well, that's a darn shame. You know what, I was working on the blueprints for a new invention. But it's still in the embryonic stage.
Squidward:	 Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this.
Sandy:	 I'll continue working on it. In the meantime, you boys keep your head up.
SpongeBob:	 Together forever.
Squidward:	 Misery.  SpongeBob, hasn't anyone taught you how to ride a bike?
SpongeBob:	 Don't worry, I'll drive.
Squidward:	  Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 
Customer #1:	 I gotta lay off the hot sauce.
Mr. Krabs:	  What in blazes is going on in here?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs:	 What are you two doing laying around? Get to work.
Squidward:	 If you say so. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Egad. What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs.
SpongeBob:	 Aye aye, cap'n.
Squidward:	 Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon?
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, everybody knows I'm a sponge. I look nothing like a balloon.
Squidward:	 I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register.  Whew. Can I help you?
Customer #2:	 Can I get two Krabby Patties, please?
Squidward:	 SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob:	 Two Krabby Patties coming right up.  Can't... reach the buns.
Mr. Krabs:	 SpongeBob, what's the hold up?!
SpongeBob:	 Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on it.
Mr. Krabs:	 Time is money, boy.
SpongeBob:	 Time is money. Right.  Hello bun. At last we meet. 
Mr. Krabs:	 Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth.  And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out.
SpongeBob:	 Look on the bright side, Squidward. At least we still have each other.
Squidward:	 That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace. 
Surfer:	 Whoa, rock on, freaky bro!
Squidward:	 Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us.
Sandy:	 Say hello to the 'Molecular Separator Ray'.
Squidward:	 Hello Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night.
Sandy:	 Uhh, well, I'm not quite done with it yet.
Squidward:	 What'd you say?
Sandy:	 I'm still putting it together. At best I'll have it ready, uhh, the day after tomorrow? Maybe? [Squidward pushes Sandy's air helmet]
Squidward:	 What? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak.  Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show.
Sandy:	 Well, uhh, I suppose... I'll have it ready before you go on. 
Squidward:	 Of course.  Oh, my.  Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there.
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, this is your moment. The story you will tell when you look back as a... superstar.
Squidward:	 Superstar?
SpongeBob:	 Now go out there and give them the best darn show they've ever seen.
Squidward:	 You're right. The show must go on.
Announcer:	 Ladies and gentlefish, Bikini Bottom's Community Rec Center is proud to present: Squidward Tentacles. 
Evelyn:	 Honey, I'm scared. 
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, hi.
Martin:	 Whoa. Rock on, freaky bro! Yeah. Whoo! 
SpongeBob:	 Wow, they really liked it.
Mr. Krabs:	  There you go, Squiddy.
Squidward:	 They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it [starts to laugh happily] sounds like. And...  ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating.
Sandy:	 Whoo-wee, there you boys are. Looks like I'm just in time.
SpongeBob and Squidward:	 Sandy?
Sandy:	 One blast of this Molecular Separator Ray and you'll be separated for good. 
Squidward:	  Hmph. 
Mary:	 I think I'm going to be sick. 
Billy:	 Ah, I'm out of here!
Squidward:	 Huh, no wait. Wait!  Oh, my one moment of fame... gone.  There's got to be some way to reverse this. 
Sandy:	 No, Squidward! That's a very sensitive device!
SpongeBob:	 Squidward, I wouldn't--! 
Therapist:	 So, what seems to be the problem, Mr. Tentacles?
Squidward:	 It all started when I was born.
