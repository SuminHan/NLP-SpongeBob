SpongeBob:	 ♪La La La La La La La La! Getting Clean! La La La La La doo doo doo! Ohhhh, what a delightful day it is...♪  Noooooo!  Good thing I have a spare!  I still have one more thing to clean.  Ohh, what would I do without you, wringer? Guess I'd be all wet!  And now I'm ready to go to work!  You've gotta be more careful, SquarePants!  Always gotta be watching out for... things. Things like... ... that! Oh, I saw ya. Not gonna fool me this time, soap.  This is not going well.
Patrick:	 Hey SpongeBob, have you seen my rubber duckie?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, is that it?
Patrick:	 I found you! Duckie Duck!  Quack, quack, quack!
SpongeBob:	 Uhh, Patrick?
Patrick:	 Huh...
SpongeBob:	 I hate to interrupt your reunion, but I kind of need your help over here.
Patrick:	 What do you need SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 Well, I'm a little stuck, if you know what I mean.
Patrick:	 Stuck? I can help with that.  There ya go, buddy! Now you're stuck forever!
SpongeBob:	 Gee thanks, Patrick! now I'm stuck for- fe, fe, fe, forever?!  Patrick, I wanted to get un-stuck not more stuck! How am I going to get to work if I'm stuck here forever? Must get out of Wringer! 
Patrick:	  There, is that better?
SpongeBob:	 No Patrick. It isn't. How am I supposed to flip patties like this?
Patrick:	 Okay, ya know what, SquarePants? That's quitter talk. And are you a quitter?
SpongeBob:	 No.
Patrick:	 And are you going to let this wringer get between you and your passion? Those sweet tomatoes, crisp onions. Are ya, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	 No. I'm won't let it get between me and those crisp onions, sweet tomatoes, fresh lettuce, a flame- broiled patty, a warm bun sprinkled with sesame seeds, served with a smile that says, "Hey! I can!" I'm ready!
Patrick:	 That's the spirit!
SpongeBob:	 Woo!  Don't worry Patrick! My spirits are still high!
SpongeBob:	 Hello, perfectly made Krabby Patty. Order's up!
Squidward:	 It's about time.  Hey SpongeBob, love the outfit. Where'd you get it, the hardware store?!  Hardware store!
SpongeBob:	  Hardware store! No, from my bathroom.
Squidward:	 Well, I must say, it really completes your imbecile look. Way to go, buddy.
SpongeBob:	 Aw, thanks, pal. 
Squidward:	 
SpongeBob:	 Ohh! Squidward! Squidward!  Are you okay?
Squidward:	 Please just get away from me.
Customer:	 Excuse me, can I have a refill on my soda?
SpongeBob:	 Ohh! A refill! 
Customer:	 Oww! Oh, my foot! Oh, my foot!  Oww! My back!  My face!
SpongeBob:	 Gasp! Not to worry, sir. I'm comi-i-i-i-ing--  Whoa!  Don't worry, everybody, I'm ok-  Hey! Don't touch Mr. Krabs' money!
Mr. Krabs:	 Me money! What do you think yer doin'?  That ain't yours.  Thank you very much. When I get my hands on that boy... 
SpongeBob:	 Here, Mr. Krabs. I'll help.
Mr. Krabs:	  Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today.  And don't even think about coming back here until that destructive device of yours is gone. 
Patrick:	 Hey SpongeBob, how was work?
SpongeBob:	 Oh, an absolute disaster. I can't do anything without this stupid wringer getting in the way. Patrick, I am nothing more than a-- a bike rack. A sad, sad, sad, sad little bike rack. 
Patrick:	 Hey! Don't you go crying on me!  Crying never solves anything. I know what always makes you feel better.
SpongeBob:	 You were right! Ice cream always makes me feel better!
Patrick:	 Dig in!
SpongeBob:	  I can't even eat ice cream now?! This dumb wringer's in the way!
Patrick:	 Bummer. Hey, ya know what? Forget this place. Let's go to the carnival. That's the funnest spot in the ocean. 
Patrick:	 Look! The ball toss!
Ball Toss Vendor:	 Step right up folks! Throw a ball, hit the cans, and win a stuffed seahorse!
Patrick:	 We wanna play!
Ball Toss Vendor:	 Sure. Gimme your best shot. 
Patrick:	 Thanks.  Woohoo!  Now you try.
SpongeBob:	 
Patrick:	 Ohh! Ohh! The spinning steering wheels! Oh, we gotta do that!
SpongeBob:	 I don't know... I have too much eye pain.
Patrick:	 Oh, come on! How many times does the carnival come to town?!  Ready?
SpongeBob:	 
Patrick:	 SpongeBob?
SpongeBob:	  Oh, dear Neptune! Why?!
Patrick:	 Hey pal, want some of my cotton candy? They gave it to me when I won the dart tournament. I got this too!  Check it out!
SpongeBob:	 That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy.
Patrick:	 Well, have some. It'll make you feel better.
SpongeBob:	  I said I don't want any! 
Patrick:	 You ruined my cotton candy!
SpongeBob:	 Good! Maybe now you know how I feel about you ruining my life!
Ball Toss Vendor:	 Check it out! Public fight!
Other Vendor:	 Working at the carnival sure has its perks. 
SpongeBob:	 I have never felt so ashamed.
Patrick:	 What do you mean?
SpongeBob:	 If it wasn't for your Forever Glue, I wouldn't be stuck in this thing!
Patrick:	 I was only trying to help.
SpongeBob:	  Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today! 
Patrick:	 Okay, if that's how you feel... I won't help you anymore! 
SpongeBob:	 Heh, heh, a lot of drama with that one.
Sandals:	 Ya know, kid, your body isn't the problem. It's your heart.  You deserve what you've gotten. C'mon, we're out of here.  Some people are just born mean. 
Patrick:	  Forget SpongeBob, I don't need him.  I can do whatever I want!  I don't need him.  Forget it, you're not his friend anymore. I gotta keep myself occupied so I don't think about Sponge--  I'm not gonna even say his name! What to do, what to do... I know! I'll have a staring contest!  Ohh, fiddlesticks. That game's too hard.
Patrick in a Thought Bubble:	 Maybe if SpongeBob was here he could give you pointers.
Patrick:	 Who asked you?!  Forget it. I'll just play...uh... fetch!  Where is it? Where is it? Gotcha!  Is SpongeBob okay? Oh, what do I care? I'm no longer supposed to help.  Buddy!  Uhh! SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Hey, whatcha watchin'?
SpongeBob:	  My favorite show.  Ha, ha, I love that part!
Patrick:	 SpongeBob! Snap out of it! It's me, your best friend, Patrick!
SpongeBob:	 What's that? I can't hear you what with all the lonely voices in my head.
Patrick:	 Oh, man -- he's too far gone.
SpongeBob:	 Not fit to live in society...
Patrick:	  This is all my fault! Me and my dumb ideas!  I'm so sorry! 
SpongeBob:	 Patrick! Your tears! They're melting the glue! Keep crying! I'll do the same and maybe I can slip out of this thing!  Look! It worked!
SpongeBob and Patrick:	 All right! 
SpongeBob:	 I guess crying does solve your problems after all. Come here, buddy! 
Patrick:	 Well, at least we're together! Heh. Hey, should I get the glue?
