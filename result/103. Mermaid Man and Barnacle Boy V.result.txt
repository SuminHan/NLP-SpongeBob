Narrator:	 The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.  In a familiar restaurant, in a familiar part of town, a call goes out in frustration.
Frank:	 Will you hurry up?
Narrator:	 A call that would normally be answered by Bikini Bottom's semi-retired champions.  they weren't the ones causing the problem.
Mermaid Man:	 Let's see...I wanna, no. I wanna, uh, no, uh, hmmm...
Squidward:	 Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!
SpongeBob:	  Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty.
Mermaid Man:	 I've made my decision.
Line of Customers:	 Hooray!
Mermaid Man:	 One Krabby Patty for me and a Pipsqueak Patty for the boy.
Barnacle Boy:	 Now, wait just a darn minute.
Line of Customers:	 Awww!
Barnacle Boy:	 I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty. I want an adult size Krabby Patty.
Mermaid Man:	 The Krabby Patty is too big for you. You'll never finish it.
Barnacle Boy:	 Don't you see what you're doing. You're treating me like a child.
Mr. Krabs:	 The boys eyes are bigger than his stomach. 
Barnacle Boy:	 And that's another thing, I'm not a boy! I'm so old I got hairs growing out of the wrinkles in my liver spots. 
Squidward:	  One Pipsqueak patty  and your bib and highchair.
Barnacle Boy:	 I'm 68 years old and I want a Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man:	 Your Pipsqueak is getting cold. Shall I feed you?
Barnacle Boy:	 Feed this, old man! 
All except MM and BB:	  Ooooooooh.
Barnacle Boy:	 I'm tired of playing second banana to a man who wears a bra! From now on, I want to be called Barnacle Man! And, I'm through protecting citizens that don't respect me!
SpongeBob:	 I respect you, Barnacle Man!
Barnacle Man:	 That's Barnacle Boy, I mean, man! I... Ohh...forget it, people. If you're not going to give me the respect I want as a hero, then maybe you'll give me respect as a villain. A villain who is...evil.
SpongeBob:	 Evil??
Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Patrick, & Sandy:	 Evil?? 
Mermaid Man:	 EVIL!!!
Barnacle Man:	 I am crossing over...to the dark side! 
Mr. Krabs:	 Why should I waste money lighting the whole store? 
Dirty Bubble:	 Did someone say evil?
SpongeBob:	 Holy oil spill! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch enemies: Man Ray and the Dirty Bubble! 
Barnacle Man:	 Nighty night, you old goat!
Mermaid Man:	 Nighty-night!  Will you tuck me in?
Realistic Fish Head:	 We interrupt your bleak and meaningless lives for this news report.  Man Ray,  the Dirty Bubble, and now, playing for the dark side, Barnacle Boy...
Barnacle Man:	 Barnacle Man!
Realistic Fish Head:	 ...have been committing a series of crimes throughout Bikini Bottom. 
Barnacle Man:	 Shh! 
Senior Citizen:	  I'll get you crazy kids.
Realistic Fish Head:	 These three have named their new alliance: Every Villain Is Lemons, otherwise known as E.V.I.L.! What can we do? When will this crime wave end? How will we defeat the evil? Why am I asking  all these questions? Mermaid Man, where are you? 
Mermaid Man:	 Huh? I'm right here! Don't worry, good citizens! Nothing will stop me from defeating the E.V.I.L.!  Nothing!  Ice cream? I love ice cream! A double scoop of prune with bran sprinkles.  Mmm. 
Barnacle Man:	  You might as well give up, Mermaid Man, because there are three of us and only one of you. You don't stand a chance. 
SpongeBob:	  Are you okay, Mermaid Man? Oh, how are you going to beat those three guys all by yourself?
Mermaid Man:	 You're right.  I give up.
SpongeBob:	 You can't give up. What if we help you?
Mermaid Man:	 No, no, that's a terrible idea. But what if you help me?
SpongeBob:	 Okay!
Mermaid Man:	 Who wants to save the world?
SpongeBob:	 I do!
Sandy:	 I do!
Patrick:	 I do!
Squidward:	 I don't.
Mr. Krabs:	  Oh, yes, you do! No world means no money! Now, go save the world, or you're fired! "[runs back to the Krusty Krab][Squidward grumbles]
Mermaid Man:	 Then it's settled! To the Mermalair!
SpongeBob:	 Wow! The Mermalair!
Mermaid Man:	 These costumes belonged to the original International Justice League of Super Acquaintances!
SpongeBob:	 Wow! The I.J.L.S.A. were the most heroic heroes ever! And you had the best lunch box, too.
Mermaid Man:	 Once you put on these costumes, their fantastic powers will become yours.
Sandy:	 Wow! I didn't think super powers worked that way.
Mermaid Man:	 Sure! Power's all in the costume! Why else would we run around in colored undies?
Squidward:	 I can think of three good reasons.
Narrator:	  The Quickster...with the ability to run really...quick!
SpongeBob:	 Want to see me run to that mountain and back?  Want to see me do it again?
Narrator:	  Captain Magma...get him angry and he's bound to erupt!
Squidward:	 Krakatoa! 
Narrator:	 The Elastic Waistband...able to stretch his body into fantastic shapes and forms! 
Patrick:	 I can finally touch my toes! 
Narrator:	 And Miss Appear...now you see her...  ...now you don't.
Sandy:	 Does this outfit make me look fat?
Narrator:	 The International Justice League of Super Acquaintances! A subsidiary of Viacom.
Mermaid Man:	 So, it's settled then. We'll get one cheese pizza, one with pepperoni and mushrooms, and one with olives.
Chief:	 Super Acquaintances, we need your help.
SpongeBob:	 Holy halibut! it's the chief!
Chief:	 Thank you for the introduction, Quickster, but we all know who I am! More importantly, we've found information on the whereabouts of E.V.I.L.
Patrick:	 The whose abouts of what?
Sandy:	 You just tell us where they are, Chief, and we'll hog-tie 'em faster than you can say "Salsa Verde."
Chief:	 Our sources last found E.V.I.L. harassing teenagers up at "Make Out Reef." You know, Make-Out Reef?  Whoo hoo hoo!
SpongeBob:	 Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!
Mermaid Man:	 Those fiends! Attacking hormonally stressed-out children!
Squidward:	 Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times.
Mermaid Man:	 To Make-Out Reef,  away!
Patrick:	 Does this mean we're not getting pizza? 
John & Nancy:	 Stop, please!
E.V.I.L.:	 John and Nancy, sittin' in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!
Dirty Bubble:	 Oh!  Shine the flashlight in that car, Man Ray!
Man Ray:	 Haha, with pleasure! 
Sandals:	 Hey man, that's not cool. 
Mermaid Man:	 Leave those young lovers alone!
Man Ray:	 Well if it isn't Milk Maid Man! You've saved us the trouble of tracking you down!
Mermaid Man:	 You fiends can't win! You're outnumbered!
Man Ray:	 You senile bag of fish paste! There are three of us and only one of you!
SpongeBob:	  Make that two!
Man Ray:	 The Quickster!
Squidward:	  Three!
Barnacle Man:	 Captain Magma!
Patrick:	  Four!
Dirty Bubble:	 The Elastic Waistband!
Sandy:	  Five!
E.V.I.L.:	 M-M-Miss Appear!
Mermaid Man:	 And me makes ten, I think.
Man Ray:	 Uh-oh.
Dirty Bubble:	 I don't have a good feeling about this.
Barnacle Man:	 Oh, there goes our toy deal.
Mermaid Man:	 Super Acquaintances, attack!
Barnacle Man:	 Oh no, please, mercy!
Squidward:	 Krakatoa! 
SpongeBob:	 Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off!  Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!
Patrick:	 I'll save you, Quickster, ahh! 
Mermaid Man:	 I'll cool you off, Quickster, with one of my water balls!  Aha!
Squidward:	 Huh?! No, no, no, I'm NOT the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag... [coughs, then melts to pile of ash]
Sandy:	 Well, I guess it's up to me!  I'll sneak over...unseen...and catch them by surprise.  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!  Boom!
SpongeBob:	 Get it off! Get it off!  Whew...I'm glad that's over!
Barnacle Man:	 We did it, we won! This day belongs to E.V.I.L.!  You've lost Mermaid Man, and the superhero and super-villain rules say you have to give in to my demands.
Mermaid Man:	 Okay, what do you want?
Man Ray:	 World domination! Tell him we want world domination!
Dirty Bubble:	 And make him eat dirt! Hahaha!  In addition to the...domination thing.
Barnacle Man:	 Number one, I want to be treated like a superhero, not a sidekick. Number two, I want to be called Barnacle Man. And number three...
Man Ray:	 Come on, world domination!
Barnacle Man:	 I want an adult-sized Krabby Patty.
Dirty Bubble:	  Did you hear him say anything about eating dirt?
Barnacle Man:	 Need a hand, superpal? 
Mermaid Man:	 Good to have you back on the side of justice, Kyle. Let's go get you that Krabby Patty! "[leaves with Barnacle Boy]
Man Ray:	 Was that it? Oh, that's sickening.
Dirty Bubble:	 Oh, this reminds me of the time I went to Cancun with the killer shrimp. Oh, they had these papaya drinks...
Man Ray:	  Oh, Neptune, shut up! 
Mermaid Man:	 How is that adult-sized Krabby Patty treating you, Barnacle  Man?
Barnacle Man:	 Actually, it's pretty big. I'm not sure if I can finish the whole thing.
