Well lad, it looks like you don't even have your sea legs.
Well lad, well give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew! Go out and fetch me...  a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula...  with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments,  and, uh... turbo drive!  And don't come back till you get one!
Carry on!  We'll never see that lubber again.
That sounded like hatch doors!  Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. A smelly smell that smells smelly.  Anchovies.
Anchovies!
All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!
Whoa! Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward!  Were taking on water, Mr. Squidward!  I want my mommy, Mr Squidward!
MAN OVERBOARD! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb!
This is the end! Good-bye, Mr. Squidward!
That was the finest fast foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants! Welcome aboard!
Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!
Hip-hip!
Hip-hip!
I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty.
Ahoy, there, Krusty Krab. How could I help you?  Pizza?  Um... Of course we have pizza.
Our delivery Squid will bring it right over.
don't deliver, but  do.
Great idea! Take him with you.
This here's an advanced patty-control mechanism.  Here you can see our automated money-handling system. Don't touch!  These are high-quality beverage temperature devices. Imported.  This here's a prototype liquid transfer machine.  And most importantly,  You get your state-of-the-art condiment-dispersal units. Now, are you gonna buy something or just stand there cause there's a standing fee.
Sorry, can't hear you!
No.
The money is always right!
Ahoy, SpongeBob!
Don't mind if I do!
No, you dumb bunny, it says, "Hello, my name is Patrick."
Good one, Patrick!
What does yours say, Plankton?
Nice try, Plankton.
The boys eyes are bigger than his stomach.
Why should I waste money lighting the whole store?
Oh, yes, you do! No world means no money! Now, go save the world, or you're fired! "[runs back to the Krusty Krab][Squidward grumbles]
Yippee!  Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!
Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!
No, this is my one millionth dollar earned! Every crab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine! Congratulations, sir! You have just given me my one millionth dollar!
Nothing! Now get out!
Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment!  Me millionth dollar!
Congratulate yourselves, lad! A captain's nothing without his loyal crew! I mean, a crew like you  comes around maybe once in a lifetime! And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip.
No.
Try again.
Better than that!
Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams  then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?
Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up.  Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose!  Me millionth dollar! (his pants rip off) SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul you!  Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in! Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster!  There you are, ya stinkin' bilge rats. Stop playing that music! Stop it, please! I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it. Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob.
For a second or two, I thought she was a goner!
Oh, Squidward, you're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar!  I lost me dollar! And I'll never get it back!  Never, never, never, never, never...
You will? Great! Wait right here.  Here's where clam fishing gets serious!  Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip.
And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar.
Could it be?  Me millionth dollar?  Whoo-hoo!  Wait a minute...  This isn't me millionth dollar.  This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.
I trusted you, and you gave me this? I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this.
I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.
No, it's this sandwich.
Not a sandwich.  The sandwich.
Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back.
So, you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. "It's just a dumb old dollar. Let's just leave the old man. He won't notice."  Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you:  live bait.
Oh, he'll come.
Come on, fresh meat!  Keep thrashing! He likes it!  Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there.  That's it!  Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it!  I finally got me millionth dollar.
Hello, boys!
Have you boys met...  ...me millionth dollar?
It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter. So, eventually, we settled on a trade.
Nothing important.
SpongeBob! What's wrong?
Thank you, sweet pea. I see you got creative with the bran today.
Oh, barnacles! I hate the pill.  Pearl, do you think I'm... old?
But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?
Coral, eh?
Well, what if I said it with a different inflection? Co-.
Whoop, you're right!  Have a coral day, honey!
Ha! Old? What was I thinkin'? I ain't old. Huh?
Hey, get away from me. I don't need no snot-nosed little...  Sorry you had to see that.
Hey, how's about I join you kids?
No! No! I ain't old like you! I ain't old! I ain't old!
Well, little patty, we're two of a kind. We've both lost our luster.  Hmmm, so that's what I taste like.
Hmmm, those youngsters are going out for a big night on the town.
Hey, boys, hangin' out?
I couldn't help overhearing your big plans. And I was wondering if you had room for one more craaaaazy dude tonight, huh?
Oh, hadn't even crossed me mind. But, sure, I'll go!
Uhh, yeah, course I know it!  Uhh... uhh...
Uhh... how do you do?
Great! Why don't you boys show up at my house at eight o'clock?
Oh, I'm ready to party! Are you ready to party?
I'm ready to par-tay! Are you ready to par-tay, SpongeBob?
I'm ready to party! Are you ready to par-
So, what kind of hot rod will we be cruising in tonight?
It's more like a chick repellent. And there's only two seats.
Are you sure this is what the kids are driving these days?
We used to beat people up for saying things like that! Everything's all topsy-turvy now.
They sure are giving these clubs some crazy names! I have to tell you boys... I'm a little nervous. I haven't been, you know, on the scene for quite a while now.
Cool. Gotcha.
Any port in the store! wait a minute. This is a Laundromat.
You know, I love staring at delicates as much as the next guy, but it's just that I thought we'd see more of the nightlife. Something that'll give you that wild and crazy hot-blooded feeling, if you know what I mean.
Debauchery!  Debauchery? I never thought of picking up trash under the highway as hot-blooded, but if it's what the kids are into...
Not yet.
I'm feeling a warm spot.
So, you wanna know if I can feel it?
Do you really wanna know if I can feel it?
Because I can feel it. You wanna know what I'm feelin'?
I'm feelin' like a total barnacle head!  You think this is cool?!  How about this!  And this? Am I with it now?  You guys wouldn't know a good time if it bit you in the end! I'm going home. You guys ain't cool. You're lame!
Lame! You're nerds! Geeks! Creeps! And babies!
I may be old, but even an old bag of shells like me knows that you haven't suggested one cool thing all night! So good night to you!
The what?
Panty raid? You're talking about girls, right? Girl girls?
And you're talking about raiding their dressers for their underpants, right?
Well, count me in! If this works, I'll take back what I said about you two being lame!
Now this is more like it!
Frilly things! We hit the jackpot!
You finally came through for me, boys! I feel young again!
Mother?
Well, I, uhh, uhh, heh, hehe...  Why didn't you tell me this was my mother's house?!
But it was all SpongeBob and Patrick's idea!
Yes, Mommy.
That's all right, lad. I certainly feel younger.
Good night, SpongeBob.
Yes, Mommy.
What happened?  Someone tried to throw away a patty!
And tomorrow a customer will find it under his bun.
You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?
I don't understand. We haven't had a customer in weeks. I wonder if it's the new placemats.
Gone bad? That's nonsense. Bring it here, SpongeBob.  Uh, why is it in a cage?
You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are.  No...no...  Stay...  Thatta girl! There, there.  See? Good enough to eat.  Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then.  SpongeBob?
Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet!
So I'm gonna be ok, doc?
Everything ok, doc?
That's not a good sign.
Oh, no, it's the Flying Dutchman!
I'm not Eugene Krabs, I'm, uhh, Harold. Harold, uhh...  Flower!
What do you want from me?
Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!
Blec! Why does it smell so foul?
Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't want to go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!
Mommy!
You have me word as a sailor.
Hey, boys!
You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money,  touching money...  Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs.  Welcome all, welcome!  Hello, little one. What you got there?
Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?
No, silly! It means free toy!
I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills!  Hello boy! Say, where's Squidward?
Great!
SpongeBob?
SpongeBob!  That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.
Sorry about the confusion.  Free toy?
Squidward! How's the break coming?
Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy.  Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?
No expense spared for my valued customers.  Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.
Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.
Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is.  Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad.  I'll just subtract it from today's profit.  And... there's no money in here.  How delightful.
Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon.
Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!
You mean... I'm awake?  No more refills!  Give me back them toys, you freeloaders!  Show's over, cheapskate!
Your luck just ran out.
Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off.
I'm not cheap, I'm generous!
Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you.  Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.
That depends, how much money we talking about?
I'll take the money.
Look, Squidward, money!
You think I could've gotten more?
Oh, what have I done?  I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook. I don't want this foul money.  I want SpongeBob back!
You heard what I said about the money?
Heh, about trading you for pocket change...
You would have?
Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?
Whee-hoo!
The money!
Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!
You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break.
Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance.  Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever.  I guess that's what I like best.  Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal.  Come here, you little piggies!
What? But that's impossible.  What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children?  I guess summer isn't coming this year.
Playground? Luring away me young customers. Warm up the boat, SpongeBob.
Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob.  So weak and malnourished.  With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing.  Breaks me heart. [] No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!
True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do.
SpongeBob!  You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!
Yes, Krabby Land!  Where a kid can have fun... for the right price.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?
Nice to meet you, Monroe.
Mmm... a-ha!  Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land!  Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.
All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land! []
Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability wavers!  Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!
Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties.  Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.
He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.
I don't know. Be entertaining.
Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?
Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!
Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!
Get out there and tell 'em!
Hey kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?
All right, here you go!  Hey kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties!  Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!
Hey, I ain't cheap!  Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.
The children? I don't care about the children.  I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose.  Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest.
Huh?  Oh, hey kids.  Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.
Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff!  No! Not that green stuff!  Noooooooooo!
Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot!  This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour.
Fall in for inspection! All right, you two...  Hat and uniform seem to be in order.  Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.
Okay, boy, your turn.
Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?
Attention, Krusty Krab crew! All hands report immediately!
Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.
No.
But he was persistent!
Uh-uh.
He used disguises!  Super science!  Civil disobedience!  And I always came out on top!
But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open!  You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.
SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?
I'll take this one.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I help you?
You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?
Uh, sure.  Here you go.
Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good.
Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!
Or what?
Well then, allow me to suggest your next move.
And now for the chaser!
Well, Mr. Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours. Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for...
What?!
Ah, you and what army, bug?
You planted grass?
Uh-oh.  You'll never get away with it, Plankton.
Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination.
Curse you Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear!
Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula.
I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes.
Eye.
Plankton! Wait!
I'm warning ya...!
Don't do it!
I warned ya.
Hey. Why ain't you running?
Get out of here!
Of course not!  And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out.
Curse you, Squidward!
I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'! When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?
The Tattletale Strangler?  Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you!
Ghosts? Ha! I ain't afraid of no ghosts! Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief...  And his dried-up sea leprechaun.  And a bit of gold never hurt.  But to be on the safe side, I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot,  got me shivering timber brace,  and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down.  And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor. And if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weaponthe specter deflector!  So just try and get me, you ghosts! Bring it on.
Wha?
Stay back, I'm well-armed!
I'm warning you!
Ooh!
I gotta get out of here!
You'll never get me!
Please, spirits, leave me be.
No, spirits, please!
No!
No! Don't burn me dollar!  Well, well, well, if it isn't SpongeBob and Patrick.
So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts.
Hey, come on boys, I'm hip! I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age. Had me some laughs. That's what we did tonight, right? We had a good laugh. Come on, laugh with me.  Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?
Of course it does. Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees ya nude.
Woo, now we wouldn't want that, would we? It's getting late now. You two pranksters better get going.
Don't mention it.
The Krusty Krab presents... live nude pranksters!  Starring the Bikini Bottom Ghosts!
Finished! At last.  What do you boys think of my masterpiece?
What the...?  ...The Chum Bucket open 23 hours? So that little piece of flotsam Plankton thinks he can stay open longer than me, does he?
Well, he's wrong!
As of now, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours!
All right, everybody. The Krusty Krab is entering day 3 of non-stop service! Let's give it up for day 3!  Yee haw, day 3!
Day 10 of non-stop service!
No one goes home!
Quit your bellyaching, Squidward; you don't hear SpongeBob complaining, do you?
You could learn a few things from that boy.
All right, you can sit down for five minutes. Then it's back to work.
Eww! A spider bug.
Krusty Krab! The restaurant that never closes. Would you like to place an order?  10,000 Krabby Patties! We'll start your order right away, Mr...uh, uh...What was that name again?  Uh huh...Peter Lankton. Wait a minute; this isn't some kind of prank, is it?
Good! We'll call you when it's ready, Mr. Lankton.
Kick it into high gear! We've got a big order!  I'm counting on you, boy. I need you to raise that spatular.  Yeah! And I need you to say, "Team Krusty Krab!"
That's me boy! Now, make me 10,000 Krabby Patties.  And no breaks!
Day 15! Give it up for day 15!
Day 23! Give it up for day 23!
Day 30!
Day...35...!
Day...  anyone know how many days it's been? I've lost track.
What the flimflam?  What are you doing in here, boy? You're wasting all me food.  Boy?
Boy, I'm worried that...  Got it?
Sure, I said I'm worried that...
All right. Now you're just acting silly. I want you to...
There, there. I'm sure it's nothing that getting back to work won't solve. Here's your Spatular.
and here's the grill.
and here are some fresh Krabby...
Hmm, there may be a problem after all.
No, a psychiatrist.
Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy.
Well, I can safely say, "No more 24 hour shifts", because 23 hours will be plenty!
No, seriously. Get back to work!
Come out here, boy.
Hush boy, or you'll give away the location of me hidey-hole.
It's where I hide me treasure.  Catch!  Let's get that chest to the office, boy, pronto!
A treasure trove of sorts. It's me memory chest from my years in the navy.
Well, my navy buddies and I are having a reunion. And I wanted to wear me old uniform.
Arrgh!  It's me first tattoo.
And this is me 'Manly Toughness Trophy'.
By being the toughest of the tough!
Me shipmates. The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep. There's "'Ol Iron Eye", , and "Mutton Chop", , me, , "Torpedo Belly", , and "Lockjaw Jones".
Of course! I was called "Armor Abs Krabs".
What do you mean?
Oh, really?  This is me navy cadet uniform. Prepare to eat your words 'cause I haven't put on more than a couple of pounds.  Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger. But I'm still the toughest of the tough. Go ahead, lad, give em a punch.
Not in the stomach! In me armor abs!
I still got it. Now be a good lad and go get your station in ship shape. And leave an old sea-dog to revel in his memories.
No!!
Don't look at me! Leave me be!
It's true. I've molted.
It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell. It falls off!
'Armor Abs Krabs' can't show up at the reunion like this. All pink and soft and unmanly. I'm all flab and no ab!
SpongeBob!
Yeah.
I can't go anywhere ever again. Stupid, no good...
SpongeBob, you're a genius.
No, you barnacle brain. Not your silly metaphor. You, in me shell. It gives me an idea. You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me.
Course, you'll need some time to approximate me personality.
Alright, show me what you got.
Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad.
That's me.
Yeah, ok I get the point.
That'll do SpongeBob.
No you're not. Don't blow this for me, SpongeBob.
Oh, what have I done?
I've created a monster.
I don't believe it. SpongeBob is pulling it off.
Uh-oh, this could be bad.
He did it.
This is the best night of my life. Me naval buddies still think I'm manly. And I didn't have to shed myself.
Say something.
'Atta boy.
I'm doomed.
Phone call for Mr. Krabs!   Get off the stage.
Oh no.
I can't watch.
No!! He's not Eugene Krabs. I am.  Alright lads, take a good look. This is who I am. I've molted me shell and I'm vulnerable.  But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher. No offense, SpongeBob.
C'mon lad, let's go home.
I don't understand.
You, too, Torpedo Belly?
Yeah, poor suckers. At least my shell will grow back.
Just stand aside, lad, and let me unlock the door.
Oh, you made me drop me keys. Give me some space, lad. Can't a crab get a little space now?
Arrgh, me back!
No. I'm just doubled over in pain, fightin' back tears in me eyes because it's a new dance craze!
I am hurt, ya idiot!  I'm sorry I snapped at ya, laddie. It's just me back is killing me. It's me old, lumpy mattress. It's like trying to sleep on broken coral. I'm going out of me mind.  Oh, me back.
Oh, me back. Well, here goes another useless attempt to sleep on me mount less, lumpy mattress.  Huh, that's queer. Me mattress seems strangely cozy and butter-like...
Armageddon! What? Oh, you? What in the blue eye scallop are you doing in me bedroom?
So, where's me old mattress then?
All my money was in that mattress.
No!
No!
Is there money in it?
It's... me money!  Oh, money. I promise I'll never leave you alone again.
Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I didn't recognize you. Say, why are you two dressed like meat?
Look at you, Plankton. Once again you've fallen flat on your back in a pathetic attempt to steal me formula.  Though you've tried and tried, you haven't had the smallest nibble of my delicious formula.  And you never will!  How do you sleep at night, no wonder you're a complete failure?
Sue?!
Wait! Hold up a second! Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?
Scoundrel! You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!
I'm in a blue ruin. I'm doomed!
What I really need is a good lawyer.
So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?
What is it, lad?
Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you. Why, you'll be more of a...  of a liability than an asset.
Ah, run along. Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration. I've got to get to the courthouse early. There's only a few free parking places.
Never, you little runt!
What? No. I didn't lay a claw on him.
He's lying! Bah!
I don't know where he could be.
What are you doing here, SpongeBob?
Really?
Is there a problem?
Pull yourself together, boy.
How's it coming lad?
It's a "wet floor" sign.
Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't.  No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed superfluous?
No! No-no! No!  Daddy's got ya. Daddy's got ya. Daddy's here.  A little glue, a little tape. It'll be right as rain.  Daddy didn't forget ya.
Ahh, Squidward, a loyal employee.
What!
Must...open...case.
I'm doomed.
You may as well give up on that case, me boy. My goose is cooked.
It's...  It's just his lunch. Or is it?
I'll take that!
Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp.
Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning.
A present? For me?
Well, it'll do. After all, it's free!
SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late.
SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different.
Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on.  Knew I'd figure it out.
Refund?! What's wrong with it?
What the...?
SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!
Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong.
That's enough, boy. See it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes it's what you don't say. Understand?
Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work.
That's me boy!
Wh...?
What? Guy in a suit? No, it's a tax collector!  Hide us, SpongeBob!  Now we'll walk nonchalantly to the rear exit.
What? My machine has arrived?! Oh, let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in.
That's it, set her down easy.
Only the greatest money maker since the Krabby Patty.  Gentlemen, meet .
At a quarter a pop, this thing will pay for itself in no time. Which reminds me, step up boys. First one's free.
C'mon, Squidward, you know you want to.
Squidward! In the machine!
My work here is done.
At a quarter a pop, this thing pays for itself in no time.
Need some change?  There ya are.
No, no, Mr. Squidward. Thank you.
Need some more change?
Need some change?
What? Why?
All out of? Hmmm.  Boys, it's payday.
What the... No. It's payday, me boy. Here's your check, SpongeBob.
I took the liberty of turning your paycheck...  ...into quarters. Just in case you wanna... oh, I don't know, do laundry or  buy a soda or... something.
No, he doesn't. You don't listen to him, Squidward. You keep playing until you win!  What's this?
Okey-dokey, then. Carry on.
That's funny. Last time I checked, you were a cashier.
I'll try to remember that.  3,498 of Squidward's quarters... 3,499 of Squidward's quarters.
What the?!
Here they come, lads.
Thank you very much, madam.  I feel so alive! Cha ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. Money, oh money, how I love thee. Cha-ching. Cha-chong. Cha-changaroo. From pennies to dollars. Any amount will do. Cha-ching. Cha-ching. It's no contest. There's only one thing that I love the best from every sight I ever seen, to sweetest sound I've heard. I'd gladly give up everything for all the money that I've earned! Cha-ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed!
Ahoy there, matey. Can I help you gentlemen with something?
Who wants to know?
Howard Blandy? You mean the Howard Blandy? The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom? That Howard Blandy?  I worship you.
Sorry, it's just you're rich.  I'm Mr. Krabs. To what do I owe the honor of having you at the Krusty Krab, Howard?
Buy the Krusty Krab? It's not for sale. You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. It's not about the mon...  Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me.
Jumpin' King Neptune!  Sold. Can I have my money?
Do I still get the money?
That'll be fine then.  Here you go. Now gimme gimme gimme gimme.  Whoo-ha! See ya around.
I'm retiring!
I'm free to do whatever I want. I can learn to ride that bicycle I got 30 years ago. Or go to the new hook museum downtown. Or even paint bowls of fruit. Aren't you happy for me?
So long, boys.
Ahh, the sweet smell of a brand-new day. First stop: the new hook museum. And then maybe I'll...  Hey, the Krabby O' Mondays? Not the name I would've chosen. But that's all behind me now.  Wait a minute, I hate golf!  Well, I've done everything I wanted to do. And it's not even noon.
How's it going?
Whatcha up to?
Oh, really?
Oh.
Actually, I was hoping you and I could do something together.
Find some friends she says, find a hobby she says, get a job she says...  Help wanted.
Morning, SpongeBob.
Retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. So, I'm the new bus boy.  Uhh, ok son, you're starting to creep my out.
Ok, boy, back to work.
I'm not your boss anymore. Just call me Eugene.
Ahoy, Squidward.
Sure, Squidward. Ya know, I've never seen you this happy.
That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy?
Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules.
What's this? Help me.
What have you done to real Squidward?
What's going on around here? Where's SpongeBob?
SpongeBob, what happened to the Krabby Patties?
This is obscene.  Carl, I need to have a wor...
Automated cash register? Noo!  Hey, Carl, what have you done to me restaurant? Processed Krabby Patties? Computerized registers?
That's because they don't know what they're eating.  Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that patty you're eating?
See that, without all your smoke & mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage.
Rules! Here's a rule for ya: people can't eat stain glass barstools!  I'll show you automated!
You better believe there's a problem! I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy! But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction! Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time! Not on a conveyor belt!
I'll buy it for full price.
Pleasure's all mine. Now get out of me restaurant.  We did it, boys.  The Krusty Krab is ours again. Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. And I got back the love of my dear friends.
No, not really. Get back to work.
Come in.
What's wrong, boy?
You've come to the right place, son. Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh.  Don't it just tickle you, boy?
This calls for drastic measures. I don't usually do this but you seem desperate. touch it.
Oh, this is worse than I thought. After all, money is the ultimate source of joy.
The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on.
They wouldn't pay me.
Oh, money. You're always there for me.
Mother! Uh, what brings ya by today?
How much of my money do you want?
Oh, look at the time! So sorry to have to rush off. Bye!  Whew, that was a close one.
Ah! Quick, SpongeBob, swallow me wallet!
Oh, sorry, Mommy. I can't lend you any money. SpongeBob accidentally swallowed me wallet.  Mommy, you got yourself a hat without my financial assistance.
But, Mommy, you shouldn't be spending my inheritance...I mean, since you told me you wanted a hat, I went out and I dug one up.
Yes, Mommy.  Squidward, I need you to make a return for me.
Boyfriend? Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?
Wonderful! I'll stay open late so ye can have a nice, romantic dinner. Run along, make yourself pretty. SpongeBob, you're working late tonight. No overtime!
Plankton!
Mommy?
SpongeBob...
This no-good conniving chiseler is your date?
SpongeBob! I don't know what sort of skullduggory you're up to, Plankton, and I'm not waiting to find out.
But, mommy...
Mommy?  You!
I came to warn you, Plankton. Stay away from me mother. I know what you're really up to.
All you love is thieving and conniving. Now, stop trying to get the formula out of me mother.
I'm talking about the Krabby Patty formula!
Don't play stupid with me. Of course she does. It's an old Krabs family recipe. And you're not family!  I'm telling you for the last time: stay away from me mother.
Mommy!
Mommy, can't you see? He's trying to seduce the Krabby Patty formula right from under you.
Uh, yeah...funny thing about that.
Yes, mommy.
Oh, brother.
Ah, that's it! No more hiding in my room like a scared little kid, it's time to act like a man!
Please don't marry him, mommy! Don't marry this bad, bad man! I don't want you to!
What are ye lads doing?
Great! I got cinema's newest star, right here.
So, what do ye say, lad?
I wasn't talking about Pearl. I was talking about the Krabby Patty.
You are, Pearl. Mermaid Man wouldn't be anywhere without you. Go out there and break a leg.
I closed early for your movie. Where are the paying customers? You promised a full house.
Now, this is what I call a happy ending.
Two bucks?!
Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this?
How about a discount on restroom tokens?
How's about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it!  No! Come back! Two dollars! Two dollars, no! No!
That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck!
Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!
Urrgh!
No! Come back! No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!
Why you talkin' funny, lad?
Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!
But you're fine, me boy!  Ohh... uhh, well... maybe not.  All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties.
It's like riding a bike. You never forget!  Uhh... I'm gonna help ya!  If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order.
Take your time.
It is?
Don't talk like that!
It's time.
And there's the pickles from last time too!
Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...
Hip hip...
Hip hip...
What in blazes is going on in here?
What are you two doing laying around? Get to work.
Egad. What happened to ya? Uhh, I don't want to know. Just go do your jobs.
SpongeBob, what's the hold up?!
Time is money, boy.
Alright, that's it. I can't afford you jeopardizing me business. You two are more trouble than you're worth.  And don't come back until you get this problem sorted out.
There you go, Squiddy.
Good morning! The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!
I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: "We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request". Everything was perfect until I got the bill! They charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger!  If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born.
Come inside.  Isn't it beautiful?
My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is "We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request".
If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service.
Ok, Squidward,  man the front desk.
Squidward,  can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty.
What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor?  I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator.
Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help.
He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it.
He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!
Deny no guests!  Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there.
Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!
Quit? You can't quit.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!
What do you think you're doing?
I don't have to rent you a room!
Oh... here's your room key.
And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken.
You've got to be kidding me!
Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it.
What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!
Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward.  SpongeBob!
What is it, Squidward?
Here's your homemade cookies.
Well, how  your mother make 'em?
SpongeBob!
Great! Now that me laundry's in the trunk...
Well?
So you're all taken care of?
What?!
This room is exactly the same as when we started!
Let's get outta here, SpongeBob!
The pool's out back!
Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?
You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!
Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start.
$15,000?!
Not at these prices! Forget hotels! This hospital rack is where the money is!
Pack your bags, boys! You're going to medical school!
Neptune's trousers!
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer a room on the ground floor?
It is?  Oh, I mean it is! Very special. Very very special, indeed.
None at all.
I knew that. How could you think I wouldn't know that? What are you gonna be, 12?
Well, we don't want that to happen.
Everybody brace for impact!
Now, now, don't snap your mizzenmast. Everything is all set. Why, I've already got the party favors--bubble wrap!  This year's gonna be a blast.
I promise.
SpongeBob?!
While I plan the party, I want you to buy Pearl's present.  Here you go, boy.
It's me credit card. You use it instead of money.
Exactly.
Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work.
I've had that since the day she was born. I got it on sale.
Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor.
Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'.
You're a real fan, huh?
All their songs?
It's almost time for the party to start!
SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?
Everybody get into position.
Who wants cake?
And frosting.
Oh, even better sweetie. Hit it.
Pearl, come back.
I'll make it up to you somehow, Pearl.
I did? I mean...I did?
Boy, how much is all this costing me?
I ought to...
Ah, nothing's too good for me daughter. Heh.
Don't push your luck, boy.
HUH?! Monster Krabby Patty?!
Well, we better get back to work.
Use another spatular.
Whats all the lallygagging about?
This better be good.
Alright, what's going on in  ...ooh... don't you have any shame, boy?
Le Spatula! What in blazes is that?
Well, what can it do?
Ooh, that sounds excitin'. Let me have a go at it.
What? Are you going against your commanding officer?
With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.
Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket.
What happened?
I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.
Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers.
Nothing. Oh well.  That sounds like a quarter crying for help.  Come to papa!
Yeah? Well that kid looks pretty shifty to me. How do I know he didn't steal it?  Hey! That little brat is throwing perfectly good money away! Oh, so if I can't have it, no one...  I hope he throws all your retirement money down a hole!  Poor little quarter. What the...? This well is full of money! Don't worry little fellas, I'll save you!  Oh, it's no use. Me poop deck's too big.
No!  I'll save ya, money!  Gotcha. What do you heartless brutes think you're doing?
And then what?
You mean suckers throw in money down a hole for fun? That's the greatest scam ever.
Squidward, SpongeBob, I got a new job for ya.  X marks the spot of the Eugene Krabs Memorial Wishing Well
Oh, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?
It's beautiful.  You smell that boys? That's the smell of money.
All right, Squidward, you can go back to the register.
Hold on there, SpongeBob. Let me show you your new station. It's kind of a promotion. Sorta.
To collect the money!
See ya in 8 hours.
SpongeBob, what kind of haul did you get?
Well, I could probably get a couple of bucks for Patrick. Nah. You better just hand up the money.
Uhh, not yet. But I'm sure if you believe strong enough, and dug deep enough, everyone's wishes will come true.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Goodness, no. You gotta stay down there just in case any late-night wishers come by. I'll be back for ya at dawn.
Good morning, SpongeBob! Let's see what ya got.  Boy, it's heavy. Must be a lot of money.
Squidward? What were you doing down there? I didn't approve of the overtime. Or were you sneaking here in the dead of night for free wishes?
So how much money did you make last night?
The what?
Listen closely, SpongeBob. You don't get what you want in life just by wishing for it.  What in the deep blue is that?
Just a coincidence.
You mean she stole that boat.
You'll never get me to believe in magic, never! Just to prove it to ya.  I'll demonstrate. I wish... I was steamed and served with a side of melted butter.
Well, where's your magic now?  Oh, where am I? What's going on here?  Uh-oh. I do believe in magic. I do believe in magic. I do believe in magic. Oh-no!!
Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time.  Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work.
What is this?  Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me.
But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?
Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?
Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer.
You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?
Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?
All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down.
Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.
Now that's an employee who follows orders.  What in blazes is that noise?
Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game.
Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere.
Eh, we'll see about that.  I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past.  Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf.
It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob.
Let's party!  Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Dance or you're fired.
How do you like them apples, you little...
Wait a minute.  What the...?  Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps?  Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war.
Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me.
Grr...
Bubkes.
Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula.  You know you want it.
A-ha, I knew it.  It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?
Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front...  ...a sham, a snow job...  ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive! See?! Who's the one with the problem?!
Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow. [chuckles]
Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move.  Oops.
I knew you'd come back.
I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton!
Uh, Plankton?
Uh, hey.
Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?
Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?
Glad you could make it, buddy.
I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over.
Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton.
That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%.
And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something.
No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula.
Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.
Come on, take it.
Sure is buddy. Sure is.
I never gave you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade.
SpongeBob, come in, boy. And bring your friends in, too. They look hungry. [uses key to open]
But they just want to dine on some Krabby Patties.
Arrgh, alright, but it's coming out of your paycheck.
But how do we know you haven't become one of those voracious flesh-eaters?
SpongeBob, it's you.
Yeah, that's SpongeBob all right.
It's... for his own good, SpongeBob.
All's well that ends well.
OWWW!
Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.
Fine?!  Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine.
Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this...SpongeBob, take a vacation.
Well, that went better than expected.
He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.
Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.
Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.
That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.
Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.
That's enough banter on my dime.
Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job.
Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.
SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?
Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.
SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?
Out you go, boy.
We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?
Well, boy...  off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over.
SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over.
I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up.  Further.  Further.  Further.  Further.  That'll do.
Now what?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  I've had enough for one day, son.
Not a problem at all, me boy.
Uh-huh.
Far out, little man. Far out.
Look boy,  I brought your spatuler.  C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it!  Enjoy your vacation, boy!
Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?
Why'd you do it, laddy?
You don't have to.  Your accumulated vacation time is used up.  The union can't fine me, anymore.
Bumping barnacles, yes.  There she is.
Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.
SpongeBob!
What in Davy Jones' locker is on your head, son?
Well, take it off. The hair's getting into the patties.
Happy?
I can imagine.
Well, if it means that much to ya, you can keep it. But you gotta wear a hairnet.  And if I see one more hairy patty, your wig goes in the dumpster.
Time to go home, boys.
Hahahaha. You wouldn't know cool if I locked you in the freezer.
Well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work.
No but's.
No, SpongeBob, it means until you get rid of that wig, get your butt out of here.
Almost ready to open.  There.
Hello, Squidward. Neptune's trousers! What's gotten into you?
SpongeBob! This is not the time for Sunday Stroll. It's time for work.
There be no such thing as opening too early, me boy. Excuse us, miss. Huh?  SpongeBob, who's your friend?
Patricia. The most beautiful sound I've ever seen. SpongeBob, do we need any more help down at the Krusty Krab?
We do? Great, she can start right away.
That's Patricia, our newest Krusty Krab employee.
Just keep your eyes on the customers, Mr. Squidward.
Order up, Miss Patricia.
This order goes to table 7 and remember your manners.
That's a 7, Patricia.
Did I order two meals? Oh, silly me. I can't possibly eat two Krusty meals, myself.  I guess you'll just have to help me finish all this food.
Patricia, we may have only known each other for a short time, now, but I feel like a special connection has been made.
Get back to work, you gold-bricking freeloader. Hut two, hut two, yah, yah! And don't come back 'til all the patties are krabby.  Well, now that we're alone, how would you like to be my date Friday night to a...
How about Sunday brunch?
So, let me get this straight, uh, you're not a woman?
Well then, you're fired. Uhh, if anybody needs me, I'll be in my office for, I dunno, the next 20 years or so.
SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.
I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.
Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.
What's this all ab...  Well, well, well. What can I do for you, Patrick?
Zip it, SquarePants... I'm talking to the rich guy.
I've got a better idea.  A buffet fit for a king.
Listen, Patrick, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to settle down. You know, get a wife, kids, a father-in-law you give all your money to.
How about you pay the check, instead?
All free?!!?  Nobody eats in me restaurant for free, king or no king!
SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?
Settle down, son. What are you all riled up about?
What are you going on about? Bikers?
Ravenous did you say? That's another word for hungry, isn't it?  Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune.
That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course.
This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again.
You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish.
Ahoy there, mateys. Motorcycle vehicles headed over the horizon.
Don't you want to spend any money?
No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money a dozen times, and it still comes up short. Profits are down. Oh, I feel sorry for me self.
What the...why didn't that guy order a deliciously over-priced fountain beverage with his krabby patty?
What? Why not?  All right, boy, it's done! You're gonna suck the whole cup down your gullet if you're not careful.
KelpShake?
Refill? That's it. Listen up, everybody! New rule: No outside drinks. No exceptions!
Grr. I better get to the bottom of this.  Ah! A new store!  On my block! Taking my customers.  Pearl.  Me own flesh and blood. How could you do this to your papa?
I'm talking about this.
Let me see that.
Why I wouldn't give them a cent.
Then you do understand.
Oh, no! Confound you, new KelpShake store. What's your secret?  Of course. Plankton, I bet he's behind this. A-ha! I knew you were behind this!
Then how do you explain this?
Don't try that with me, Plankton. This new store is ruining me business.
Wow. I guess you're really not behind this after all. Plankton, they have... a secret formula.
Oh!
Block after block.
We've got to do something about this.  You sure this is going to work?
Oh, let's see, let's see. Ah, there you are.  Plankton, I think I found the kitchen.
Here goes. Wa-choo!  I'm sorry, I have a bit of a  ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...choo!!
I think we lost them. Well, you got any more bright ideas?
All set, Plankton?
[Sighs] If you want anything done right, you've got to do it yourself.  Oh, me back.
Never mind that. What about SpongeBob?
Of course we do.
Uh...we've gone into business together. You see, SpongeBob, we were hired, uh...to fix this door.
That's right. That's right. We have to fix the roof. It's, it's, it's leaking.
No kidding.
What's that suppose to mean?
Who you are calling a gorilla, you one-cent, one-eyed bottom-feeder!?
Buy one?
I don't know about this, Plankton.
Hi there. Uh, could I get one KelpShake?
Uh, ok.
Thanks.  I can't believe we did it.
And to think this whole time I could've been selling these meself!
No way, pipsqueak. This gold mine is mine.
Nice try.
Hey, I paid good money for this thing. Of course I'm gonna drink it.  What the...? I don't get what the big deal is. This tastes like a wet gym sock.
Hmmm.  Hey, you're right. This ain't half bad.  This is amazing.
Well, we gotta get more.
Ah, phooey. You don't know what you're talking about.  KelpShake, KelpShake. Oh how I love a KelpShake.
Now what are we going to do?
Hey, wait a minute! Plankton!
Hold it right there. You're not going anywhere...[He opens the safe] without a ten second head start.
You said it.
Hey, get back here you little booger!
Reward? How much we talkin' about?
I'm on the case.
Hold on a second, there.
Uh... Squidward, me cephalopod, I'm sorry to tell you this -- well not that sorry -- the customers prefer the new smaller Squidward to you. And so do I! 'Cause he's making me some bucks. So I'm changing your job to busboy, effective immediately.  Now pipe down and watch how it's done.
Get out of the way, boy!  Me building's been condemned, boy. We got ourselves a nematode infestation.
Keep playing, lad! Take them devil sons of the sea away from me restaurant!
It's okay, SpongeBob.
Boy, you saved me barnacle the way you put the run on them nematodes.
You see, SpongeBob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things.
No.  It's about us!
Yep. And since you did such a good job, we wanna make it up to you.
So, just tell us anything your little heart desires, and it's yours.  Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the Bikini Bottom Players proudly present a very expensive production of... "The Best Day Ever." And it better be good for all it's costing me.
That wasn't in the budget!
I'm not paying for that!
Just till his little heart gives out, Squidward. Just till his little heart gives out.
Hmmm, something ain't right.  For me?
Suspicion doesn't hold a candle to birthday wishing.
Me secret formula!
Attaboy, SpongeBob!
You might as well blame me, SpongeBob.  There was a time when Plankton and I were best friends.
Friends at birth, you might say. Even as wee ones.
Things were all peaches and creams.  Until we hit grade school.
Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.
'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash.  You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to  fashion me clothes from rags.
Then one day, as Plankton and I were plotting our revenge, I met the love of me life.
Money?
Buy things? So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton.
I've got a pretty good idea, yeah.
Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called "Stinky Burgers". It was the only place to get a burger. Kids loved Stinky's.  And Stinky loved the kids.
Excuse us!
Two Stinky Burgers, please.
Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if we made a better burger, we'd make a fatter stack of loot.  But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?
So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress.
We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kid's greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant.  Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please.
T'was me first dollar I ever earned, and was also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.
I thought it was our recipe.
But what about satisfying the customer?
Give me that!
Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!
Which one? The one that says "Eject" or the one that says "Trap Door"?
What I was saying was...  You'll regret this one day!  And he always did.
Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.
Don't know what you mean.
First, I'll rule their stomachs and then...  ...their money!
Barnacles to the customers!  I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Stop, you're gonna bust it.
Malarkey.
You said it, old chum.  Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here!  Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump?
I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins!
You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.
"Plab Patties KO's Old Man J". I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy.
Hey. that guy is like family to me.
You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger.
No way, that recipe's mine!
Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything.  I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.
Oh, no you don't! This is my turf.
What? Why I oughta squash you right now. You little...
Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty.
Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best.
You callin' me a liar?
You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back.
Really?
I'd like that, Planky, old chum.
Me, too. Me, too.
Well, I'll be cooked in butter! It's Jim, the Original Fry Cook!
You're doin' well, Jim. Is that limo solid gold?
Don't worry, Jim. No one could ever replace you. The original is still underneath.
Your "Best Employee Ever" award! SpongeBob! Sweep up this mess while Jim and I catch up.
Hey, bigshot! Why don't you step behind the fryer for old time's sake?
Aye, you always knew how to make me laugh. You just don't find employees like that anymore.
You're right, boy. I appreciate you, Squidward!
Now how's about that patty?
It's a thing of beauty!
Three cheers for the world's greatest fry cook... SpongeBob!
Come here. Help us cheer for Jim.
SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  That smells like a resignation letter.  SpongeBob's resignation? Oh, this is terrible! No one's making patties! And that mean I'm not making money!
He thinks you're taking his job, so he's run off!
Well, I better go find him. SpongeBob!
Anything for you, Jimmy, me boy. Cop a squat and lay your wreck and tell me what's on your wig, Jim.
What now?
'Scuse me?
A raise? That's not in my "Hiptionary". Help me get with it, Jack.
These sideburns aren't real.
Aye, it's still as funny today as it was then.
You see, SpongeBob, you've got one quality Jim will never have: you're cheap!
So, you'll stay?
Oh, she's a dump, alright. But she's my dump.
Hey, Squidward, have you seen SpongeBob?
Whoa. You don't look so good, laddie.
Meandering mermaids! What's all this racket, boy?
Get a hold of yourself, boy.
What is it now, boy?
Then don't blink.
SpongeBob, thats enough! We've got 15 orders to fill! Now go in the cooler and get some fresh patties.
Now, look here. Your work is starting to affect me profits. You need to get some shut-eye. Why don't you get yourself a night light?
Yeah, boy! It'll keep your room lit, so you won't be scared stiff!
Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye?  Wait! Don't shoot. Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!
Squidward! Help!  Help me flip these patties! We've got growling stomachs out there!
Then would it be too much trouble to ask his high and mightiness to take these patties out to the customers? Oh If only SpongeBob were here
What's all the commotion about?
Inadequate!?! I'll have you know, the staff of the Krusty Krab take a solemn pledge, to show up every day in a week clean and disease-free.
It wasn't me! It was Squidward! He gave you all the Ick!
Oh, stop it! You're tickling me, Squidward!
He's just doing his job, SpongeBob! He's a bottomfeeder, remember? See? The little feller licked me clean! I'm cured! And he'll clean the Ick off any surface! Even Squid!
Hey, hey, hey! There's no need to fight! Cause I have a solution I'll be happy with.  Step up to be de-Icked! Only 5 dollars!
Now can I get you a Krabby Patty?
Alright!
Another 5 dollars for another de-Icking.
Aye, and a great money maker ya are, too. Now, back to work!
Just making sure the Krabby Patty formula is safe.  Plankton hasn't tried stealing the formula in over a month. He must be planning something big.
One of you will have to volunteer for some extra work.
I was just gonna ask if someone can spy on Plankton.
Shh! Okay, okay! You can be a spy. Just be quiet.
Your instructions are on this Krabby Patty. But remember, the fate of the Krusty Krab rests in your hands, SpongeBob.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to discover what Plankton's up to. Don't let him out of your sight. You'll need to rustle up some spy gadgets. If you don't accept it, you're fired! This patty will self-destruct in 10 seconds.
Krabs here. Go ahead.
Baby clothes? Hmm...  What's he doing now?
Yeah? Yeah?
A stamp.  This is the most elaborate scheme ever. Keep on him, SpongeBob.
Krabs to Agent SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.
You found out what Plankton's up to?
Well, find him, lad. I'm not paying you to goof off with Patrick.
Exactly. So get to work.
I think I put off my cataract surgery too long.
Merciful Neptune!  Man your battle stations!
Bring it on, Plankton.
He's driving me customers away! All right, Plankton, you want my customers so badly?  You can have 'em!
Ha ha ha! Huh?  No!
...win!
That's right!  I stole me own formula!
You see, we had a bet. Plankton's been trying for 20 years to steal me formula, and he's never done it!
Tell it to the claw, sister. Last time he failed, we made a bet.  You can't beat me, Plankton. I always win!
Oh, yeah right. If I was you, I could steal me formula on me first try.
You're on.  So, through a series of events far too elaborate to go into right now, we flawlessly assumed each other's lives; and I beat Plankton at his own game.  And destroyed his place of business!  Now pay up.
What's that, laddie?
Oh. You bet you, SpongeBob. Listen to this. Individual waste of the enus will substantially broaden the probability of multiple substantial visits, generating an inverse negative revenue margin of three quarters and one half of one percent: meaning if you call the customers by their names, they keep coming to spend more of their green back! So I want you two to learn the names of every customer.
I thought you might say that, so I decided to turn this into a contest. The employee who learns more names wins this.
Uh, well, actually, I wasn't keeping score. But I'll just say that you and SpongeBob are neck and neck. That mystery guy over there will be the tie breaker.
He's the ticket to your prize.
The boy and I just thought we'd stop by and check on our convict.
Enjoy your prize.
Vacation? Who said anything about a vacation?
Oh, you mean that brochure. Well, that was the prize. The brochure. It was taking up too much room in me drawers, you know. It's your prize.
Nope, just the brochure. Well, got to get back to counting me loot. Enjoy your new prize, Squidward.
Hey, SpongeBob.
What'd you do?
A minute late?
Well, uh, don't do it again.
Well, you can clean the salad bar.
Be sure to close up when you're done.
And good night, SpongeBob.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sheesh.
SpongeBob? What in Neptune's Navy is going on here?
How long you been here?
All night?
Hold on! This ain't no hotel, son.
Rent? Okay. Well, let's get ready for the customers. Start scrubbing the grill...
Well, start cooking some Krabby Patties...
Okay. Then get cleaned up. You're a mess.
Must be a full moon.  Mr. Squidward?
Oh, lighten up, Squidward. 'Tis harmless tomfoolery.
SpongeBob, you can't be hanging your delicates in me customer's faces.
Oh! I have a disgusting clientele. Who spend their money freely.
Because I'd hate for a certain living arrangementmeaning yoursto interfere with said money spending.  What the barnacles?  SpongeBob! Why is your bed in me office?
You can't stay in here. These are my private quarters, boy. The only play I can escape for solitude during the day.
Oh... Okay, but I'll have to raise your rent.
Your parents?
Squidward, who put these fancy smelling soaps in the restroom?
Argh.  That boy's taking the manliness out of me restaurant. Oh, he didn't. Floral print curtains in me office? That's it. That's the last straw! I'm not putting up with this any longer.
Oh, oh, I...I'm sorry. I didn't know...
No, I...  What the...?
Me customers!  Gone! Gone! Gone! All they wanted... was to give me...their money!  SPONGEBOB! Pack your bags, boy. You're moving out.
Squidward!
Who touched me thermostat?!
Mr. Squidward, you're always going on about your book club. Read this.
Heat costs money! There are two ways to get on my bad side, boys. I don't like kids playing in me yard, and nobody but me touches me thermostat!
What?  Hey, you kids get off of my lawn!
It means that he's a big fat cry baby
Someonetouchingthermostat.
Morning, boys.  Lock's a bit sticky this morning.  Is it cold in here or is it just me? Well, get to work.
All right, quit clowning around and get to work.
The temperature stays at 62 degrees"
I don't care if Santie Claus and Jack Frost are having ice cream cones. Don't... touch... the thermostat!
Quit your lollygagging and get a move on.
Just put those patties back when you're done.
It's beautiful. I'm selling twice as many patties and I don't even have to cook them. This is the happiest, and most cost-effective day of me whole life.
This is fantastic. The local hockey team is paying me to practice here.
I'll take that.  Brilliant idea to block the exit with your body, SpongeBob.
You lose again, Plankton.
The thermostat.
You've gone too far this time, Plankton. You can pound me employees,  try to destroy me restaurant, but nobody messes with me thermostat.
Thank you, lad.  Well, well, if it isn't Plankton. You know, I should thank you. What with the ice rink and now the swimming pool gimmick, I'm making more money than I ever did with the old Krusty Krab. Hey, you got any more good ideas?
It looks more like Plankton trying to steal me restaurant.
And it's time for The Krusty Krab to return from its vacation.
And I bet you tried to steal this, too.
You don't really think I'd leave me secret formula behind when I go on vacation. do you?
Yup, Squidward. you really outdid yourself for the new decor. Where did you get the fountain?
And these metal decorations?
And the computer?
Well, it looks great, lad. And it didn't cost me a dime.
But you're paying for enhanced ambiancedude.
Squidward! Where the barnacles is our fry cook? He's been gone all day. That boy's never been a work shirker. We got a crowd of hungry customers waiting.
Well actually
SpongeBob, what's with the fancy getup?
A dinner date? Well, blow me down, boy. I didn't know you had it in you. so when do we get to meet the little lady?  By the way, is she rich?
Ooh, a limousine.
Oh, I can smell the money already.
Your date's a Krabby Patty? Me thinks the boy's really lost it.
Oh, it's that Krabby Patty.  What are you doing with that rotten piece of meat, boy?
Sorry, boy. no can do.
What was that? I couldn't hear you.
All right, take a seat.
I think I can explain, boy. There was a time when I was in love too. She was a Krabby Patty that looked a lot like yours does.  Well, maybe not right now, but you know what I mean. She was a firm, juicy, a warm patty. And attractive- oh, she looked good enough to eat. So I did. do you hear what I'm saying to you, boy?
Krabby Patties are meant to be loved and eaten. That's what they're put in the ocean for. And it looks like yours is way past due.
Well done, boy. As a reward for your valiant effort, I'll only charge you 25 for the patty. Employee discount.
Yar-har, Pearl's my daughter, I'll spit in your eye! Yo-ho, Pearl's a whale, and it's her birthday, yar-yar-yar! Ta-da!
Oh, all right. Presents for me darling little sardine. It's from me.
Uhh... well, they might be.
Pearl, these are the finest fishin' boots available!
But I got them for a bargain!  Oh, what am I gonna do? I spent two whole dollars on these boots and now I'm stuck with them!
SpongeBoy, me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddie! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots.  So you want to get paid?
In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.
Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.
Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry.
Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable.
Paycheck! You got a deal--
You've got a deal.
You got a...
Hold on there, lad! You're gonna give me a heart attack!  You got yourself a deal.
Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music.
Five, ten, twenty, thirty...  Wha? Who's there?  Back to countin' me money.  One, two, three, four, five...  What the barnacle is that?  Arrgh, that was the worst night I ever weathered. At least I'll have some peace and quiet at work.
What's wrong, Mr. Squid-ard?
That fry cook's making me a fortune. What could be the problem?
SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob.
I... uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots.
Well, I don't... uhh... I don't... uhh...
I, uhh...
I gotta go to my office!  I can still hear it!  It's still coming through! The infernal squeak!  Those boots have got to go! And I need an aspirin.
Ah, quiet money. Silence and money.
What is it, my boy?
It's okay, son.
Hold it, boy! It's not the end of the world.
Look, don't cry. I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts!
Poor lad.
I didn't do it!  Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?
What'll ya have?
What did you say?
Huh?
What?
Huh?  Huh?  I didn't write that!
Stop it!    Oh, oh, can't you hear it? Yes, I did it! I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboard! Oh, please, make it stop! It's the squeaking of the hideous boots!  I'm sorry, but I can't take the infernal squeaking no more!  The deed is done.
Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.
I do, son.  Here's the paycheck I owe you.  Plus a bonus!  Well, there's your paycheck anyway.  I need a vacation.
Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl.
Darling, I won't.  Oh, no.
Squidward!  Stop distracting SpongeBob and serve the customers!
Did someone just say "free"? In my restaurant?!  What's the problem here?
Free?!  Mr. Squidward!
Listen up. Me customers come here for cheap food and verbal abuse, and if you can't get it right, get back in the kitchen with SpongeBob.
SpongeBob? What are you doing with those patties?
They look okay to me.
He is now. Give him an apron and put him to work. You know, he might be as good a fry cook as you.
SpongeBob?
What's the meaning of this?
A smiley face with dimples?
Mr. Squidward?
I have one thing to say to you, mister. Oh, I just love the little ketchup dimples you do!  You're the new Employee of the Month.
SpongeBob, what's the problem?
Enjoy your meal. Let me know if you need anything else.
You know what they say: "Money Talks."
Don't go goofy on me, boy. Money can't really talk. Only fish can talk.
Yeah. Wait a minute...
If I could talk to money, how great my life would be. We'd tell each other secrets, all their friends would visit me. I'd bathe in filthy riches, which is clean enough for me. Oh, if you could tell me what you want, how happy we would be. We'd surely be the best of friends, we'd never disagree. There wouldn't be a downside, not one that I could see. If I could talk to money, come along, sing with me.
If I could talk to money, and it could talk to me. We'd always be the best of friends, for all eternity.
Oh...  If I could talk to money, how great my life...  Parlez vous Francais? Hable Espaol? Ou-yay eak-spay ig-pay atin-lay? Mm-hmm. Maybe this will make you talk. Talk! You're being too hard on the little guy. You can talk to me. I'm your friend.  I would give anything to talk to money. Anything!
You?
Yeah, yeah, my immortal soul. I've heard that speech before.
Yeah, yeah, skip the lecture. I want what's coming to me.
Hey, is that pixie dust?  Whew, that was a strange dream.
Who said that?
Hey, it's a nickel. What were you doing in my belly button, little fella?
Do you have anything to say to me?
It worked! I can talk to money. Oh...
Don't worry, darlings. Soon you'll be rejoined with all your friends.
Good morning, my darlings.
You're coming home with me.
SpongeBob, I did it. I can talk to money.  Go ahead, say hello.
Oh, aren't they a riot?
Now that we're alone, let's tell each other secrets.
You have any friends you can invite over?
Nothing, nothing. You guys are great. I thought you guy might want some company, you know, to make you happy.
Ok, so how can I make you happy?
What?
What? No way.
Oh, wait a minute. I am not spending you on corn dogs, diapers, or fairy princess outfits.
Unfortunately.
I can't spend all of you. And none of you want to be spent on stuff I want.
Ah, you're all shallow and self-absorbed. What did I ever see in you?
I'm not listening...
I'm not...  SpongeBob?
Take this bag as far away as possible and bury it.  What have I done?  Give me that back.
Dutchman, you cheated me. Take this horrible curse away!  I want a refund.
Hehe, yeah, well, I sort of sold my soul already.
To those guys.
Now, now, I'm sure we can sort this out.
What's is this contraption you've hauled into me place?
But how are the patties? I mean, how do they taste?
I have to admit, that patty was yummy, though it sits like a rock when it lands in me tummy. But I've got me a fry cook, and he's always on time.
Your machine sounds delightful. But how much does it cost?
Ready, set, go...!
Ahoy, Squidward.  Good Neptune, SpongeBob. what has gotten into to you, son?
No, Squidward. this is worse. he's got the thousand-yard stare. I had it once meself back in me service days.  What is it, lad? Quick, we're losing money!  It's the boy's tiny calendar. And he has circled today's date.  "Important Food Critic visits Krusty Krab."
Why hello. You're the television food critic Gene Scallop, aren't you? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Eugene Krabs, owner and proprietor of this fine...
Squidward, you just drove away Gene Scallop. Don't you know our lives depend on his review?
M Mr. Scallop, wait, please. Before you go, come on, sit down. Try one of our delicious Krabby Patties. It's absolutely  Complimentary.  Okay, SpongeBob, that'll be all.  He's nobody.  We're doomed!
Turn it up, Squidward.
Hey, no, wait! Wait!
Ay, ay-ay-ay-ay... That's me boy, SpongeBob. That's me boy.
Okay, a little lower, lower that's perfect.
Oh, just making a few cosmetic changes.
Umm yeah, a little bit like that.
Hey, what's going on over here?
Squidward! I'm sorry, little girl. Of course you can have his autograph for $5.
Look at these, Squidward!
They're our new Krusty Sponge napkins! Extra absorbent.
Oh, that reminds me, Squidward. I need you to unpack these boxes.
Condiments. We got "Tangy Spongy Sauce" and "Mild Bobby Sauce" for the not-so-daring.
I got it right here. Here you go, Squidward.  You're on grill duty now.
Don't worry, Squidward. I got something else lined up for him.  Step right up, folks! Take a ride on The Krusty Sponge Fun Train. Tickets are only $1.98. Seatbelts not included.
Are you kidding, lad? Just look at these paying customers!  Who's ready for another lap?  Keep on truckin' SpongeBob. I've got some important business to see to in me office.
No.
Okay, Tell them I'll be right out.
And let's watch the language, Squidward.
My pleasure.
I'm glad you asked. We got SpongeBob drinking straws  coasters  bibs  and me personal favorite, SpongeBob ice cubes!  Aww.
Get back to work, SpongeBob. I'll be in me SpongeBob if you SpongeBob me.  Whoops!  There you go, Squidward.
Oh, you're going to love this. Spongy Patties.
Yeah. I want you to start using them instead of the other ones.
They were just in the boxes of patties we didn't have room for in the freezer. They turned yellow. Got to keep those SpongeBob ice cubes somewhere, you know.
Squidward, you're right! All this instant success must be scrambling my brains! We'll make them $2.98.
Uh, go away, please, I'm busy.
Who?
SpongeBob  Great Neptune's mother's stockings! Zombies they're here to eat me money.
It's a... It's a Spongy Patty.
No! But... I just... just... I can explain, I...  What the...?
No, your honor.
Eh, hang on a second there, judge. That wouldn't happen to be a SpongeBob gavel you're using?
Permission to approach the bench, your honor!
It's good to have you back, boy. Let's see how Squidward's enjoying his new position.  Take him around as many times as you like.
I love a happy ending.
Well, good night, folks. Come again.  Thought those deadbeats would never leave. Closin' time, SpongeBob.
Time to pack it in, Sponge- Bah! Wha?!
SpongeBob, what's the meaning of this? [SpongeBob inspects the plate and then notices the spot]
That's right, a spot. You know the rule. Nobody leaves work till...
Oh, and, uh, lock up when you're done.
Should've never left you alone with a lit blow torch and me roller skates. But, since I've removed all the welding equipment from the premises, there's no-ho-ho chance of that happenin' again, right? Now, get to work.
Hmmm... strange vortex in the west. Well, it's probably got nothing to do with SpongeBob.
Spontaneous molecular distortion, hmm? I guess I better go see what the lad's up to.
Oh, boy, that can't be good.
Let's see what he's done this time.
Oh, this time you've done it, boy. What've you got to say for yourself?
Oh, I'll clean your platter!  Come here, you!
Hold it right there, Plankton.
I'll take that.
Next time, wear a disguise without your initial on it.
You think! SpongeBob!
Ooh, a penny.  A trail of pennies!
Ahem!
Better be something other than bills this time.  Plankton!
I can't tolerate your stinky gas!
You'll never catch me, Plankton! Never! Oohanother penny! Come to papa! Now were we doing?
Eh? What was that, Sonny?
He's got the Krabby Patty! Catch him!
Oh, Gesundheit.
You kids get off my lawn! I'll catch up with you, boy!
That's it! Knit, little nitwit!
Right after the party. The piata party.
SpongeBob? SpongeBob!  Wake up, boy! You're burning me money!
Here, use this!
SpongeBob, come into me office.  What's wrong, boy?
This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something.
We need to get you thinking about work.
Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat.  This is your wide open range.  These are your amber waves.  And thisoh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?
SpongeBob, wait!  Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back.
Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty.
And I'll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning.
All right you filthy bilge rats!
You got three seconds to get out of me restaurant before I kick you out! Fine, have it your way!
Ah, we don't need those losers anymore! I'm turning the restaurant in to one of those fancy froufrou places, where they charge big bucks for itsy-bitsy portions!
We're getting a gourmet chef from the chef exchange program and I'm going to raise me prices to the roof!
Oh. Uh, yeah. Well, you'll be shipped off to some other restaurant somewhere far away from here! Uh details are kinda hazy, but I packed your bags and your bus leaves in five minutes!  Heh, looks like it's early.
Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
Well, he's just as affectionate as the boy.
Hey, Squidward, look at this!  We're charging 52 smackeroos for this little guy.
I don't know! Some kind of bean paste or something.
So it's supposed to smell like a rotten gym socks?
Shredded...  gold?  Couldn't we use less expensive ingredients?
Yeah, well you see those were out of stock.
I'm ruined! Busted!  Hello?
No, those aren't burglars, Pearl. Those are just friendly repo men.
Uh, well, you know, until I come up with the money I owe, I'm afraid you'll be staying with these nice gents.
No!  is more like it. They keep you, I keep my kneecaps.
Oh, Mr. Le Schnook... I lost everything! I'm bankrupt! You and your fancy eats are all I got left now.
Is it money?
Oh, I've been such a fool! I turned away SpongeBob, the best fry cook I ever had, and it cost me everything!
Oh, I can still hear his sweet little voice.
Okay, now I'm scared.
Darn his cursed mocking voice! I...  SpongeBob?
SpongeBob me boy. You came back! And you brought customers!
Well Mr. Squidward, all's well that end's well. I got me poor disgusting old clientle back, and rich disgusting new clientle to boot!  I'm back in business!
Oh no way. See, I've learned that you can't buy customer loyalty with fancy tables, froufrou food, or even sanitary conditions. Hey get back you, eat your own.  Nope, just good food prepared with love. Ain't that right SpongeBob?
Oo...uh...beautiful day for standing outside a museum doin' nothin'.
Hello there. Welcome to the museum! That'll be three dollars.
No, no, no. Today's Monday. Otherwise I wouldn't be wearing this "I hate Mondays" shirt.
Enjoy the artifacts!  Don't stand in one place too long, people might mistake you for one.  SpongeBob!  Hew, that was a close one.
Did somebody say untold riches!?
Diamond light bulbs! I wonder what they make the money out of.
Money!
Hurry up Squidward, that money ain't gettin' any younger.
Nice hot rod flames!
Quite a vessel, but who's manning it?
Bet there's some loose change in here!
Is this some kind of joke? Where's the gas tank?
Huh?
Well that's just splendid boy! A land where it rains money! More than you can spend. With fives and tens and fifties and I'll want to be your friend.
Go on, SpongeBob. Ring the bell.
What a ripoff! This street ain't gold!
I'm Eugene. I like money.
Eh, harmony shmarmony. When do we get to see the treasure?!
Comin' through, boys!
Squidward! You told me the streets were paved with gold. Now that street light better be a 600 dollar diamond or else.  Ah hold still, Squidward.
Yeah, but I feel odd.
I'd know that smell anywhere. Me pockets. They'd be smelling loot.
These are me hounds to me pants.
As much as me pockets can carry?! Oh, if I'd only known when I woke up today, I'd have stopped at me tailors along the way, and had ten more pockets put on me pants, 'cause I think I hear a money avalanche!  Look at all this cash, hey, look at all this money! I hope me heart can take it!
I'm alright, sonny! Industrial accidents can make quite a mess. Unless you fall into a money press. Oh, make me into money, Mr. wonderful machine, I always knew that me true color was green! Oh, ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of such a place, yes I did! With mountains of money, and rivers of cash. And a pool of coins to make a splash! Oh, I'll open up a Krusty Krab with patties made of money. They'd be delicious, and expensive, and taste like golden honey! Money and gold and treasure untold! And all of it for me!
Are you kidding?! I've just got here!
Can't you go any faster Sandy?
Never mind! Just keep doing what you're doing!
But what about the treasure? It was really great!
I think I'm gonna cry!
There's no place like Atlantis!
I don't wanna go back!
Yeesh, we need some customers in here.  What's gotten into you?
Oh, he needs one, eh?  Methinks a paying customer's in our midst.  Patrick, how's a Krabby Patty with extra cheese sound?
Not yet. First, I have to know, can you pay for it?
Good boy.
My good man, how you doing?  Excellent. Now, let's get down to business.
It's your bill.
What? I thought you said you could pay for it!
Non-paying customer!
You're gonna pay, one way or another.  All right, Patrick, if you're not gonna pay for your food with money you're gonna pay with hard, physical labor. I want you to swab the latrine.  I'll be back in a while to check up on you.  Bottom-feeding...
So, Patrick, how are you...?  What in blazes did you do?
See these ice cube trays?  I want you to put 'em in that bucket.
Figure it out!
What the...? What are you doing?
You've destroyed me refrigerator.  You've destroyed many of the things I love.  I got another job that even a nimrod like you couldn't mess up.  Alls you got to do is throw all of these trash bags down the trash chute, like so.  See?
Good, 'cause if you mess this up, you'll never eat another Krabby Patty again!
Here, boy, take this sack of loot and put her in me safe.
Well, well, let's see how the poor boy's doing. Well, did you earn me money back yet, Patrick?
SpongeBob is 13-1/2 minutes late for duty. I hope for his sake this means he was in a horrible accident.  Well, looks like I was right about the accident part.
He's right.
Gotta hand it to ya, boy.  Gettin' Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy to shoot for me restaurant was a stroke of genius.
Uh, hey, kids?  Uh, well, there's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the ballroom.  SpongeBob!
Go get those AWOL do-gooders you talked me into hirin', and bring their patoots back here on the double!
Back, you! Back!
That's nothing! My Great-Great Grandpappy Krabs invented the greatest thing since loose change! The spendthrift billfold system! Allow me to demonstrate.  Hey SpongeBob, how about a raise?
A-a-a watch.  See?
Every time!
Step right up, folks! Just a dollar to stomp on old Dead Eye Plankton!
I don't understand, Squidward. Where are all the customers? I know the Krusty Krab isn't Bikini Bottom's most prestigious eatery, but at least it's better than that salty old Chum Bucket across the street. And that's our only competition.
Oh, come on, Squidward. Can't you just pretend to listen for once in your life? Do it for old Mr. Krabs.
Quiet, Squidward, I'm brainstorming! Ooh, ooh! What if instead of bringing customers to the Krusty Krab, we could bring the Krusty Krab to the customers?
Yes, of course! But how?
That's it! We'll take the Krusty Krab on the road.  So long, boys. Make me lots of money!
Tell me all about it. Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me!
I don't care about that. Tell me about the money.
You let go of all the money I earned as ballast?
Gold? Heehee!
He's not digging for any gold I'm looking for.
He's already 10 seconds late! I'm docking him a month's pay for this.
Hurry up and get in there, boy! Patties need flipping.
Mr. Dollar, allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Dollar.  What the barnacles is going on?
I'm fine, as long as me money's OK.
If I were you, I'd get as far away from me as possible-- Idiot Boy!
Squidward, where the barnacles is SpongeBob? This place is going down the toilet! Patties need flipping!
Don't talk back to your superior officer, you...
What he means to say is, no, we haven't.
Let me see that.  To whom that may concern, if you found this letter, that means  sincerely... AKA...AKA? Idiot Boy? IDIOT BOY?! It is SpongeBob! What am I gonna do without me fry cook?
All right, all right, group meeting. Everybody out! The Krusty Krab's closed until further notice!  Now...  how do you propose we find me money-making employee?
You do?
MR. SQUIDWARD!!! This device was me last chance to get this place back into ship shape. And since you destroyed it, I am ordering you to find SpongeBob!
If you don't find him, you'll be out of a job forever.
Oh, Squidward, don't forget your retirement gift.
Not so fast!  Bring back me number one fry cook first.
Don't recognize the Krusty Krab? Stop your kidding, boy. And start frying up them patties.
Aye, the best in the business. Now get flipping.
All right, Mr. Squidward, a deal's a deal. Here's your fancy egg.
We're really sorry we ran you out of town, boy. But we're glad you're back.
Where's SpongeBob?
Squidward? What have you done? You know what the Krusty Krab means to me, don't ya? And you took it upon yourself to bring all these, these customers, to me. Hey, don't worry folks, There's plenty of Squidward to go around. So everybody just line up and get your pocketbooks out, first will be a small fee of $14.98 per person everyone will get the opportunity to touch Squidward.
And I'll even throw in a free soft drink for an extra $3.
Hey, where you going? Don't leave me! Please! I'm beggin' ya! Look. I can make him handsome again. Watch!  See?  He's getting handsome. It just takes a little  effort, just a little  elbow grease. Please! Come back!
Hello, this be the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob! Where you been, customers are blowin' in here like nobody's business!
Jellyfish?
Uh, I'll never understand what you just said, but if it's transportation you need, I know just the thing.  Ooh, this one's puttin' up a fight.  Fightin' too hard!  Gotta reel him in, Krabs. Cut a little slack,  then yank!  Cut some slack, then yank!  There he is. Ready for work. Quit whining, boy, and start pushing out them patties.
Hello, and welcome one, and all your money to ye olde Krusty Krabbie!
Squidward! These wretched hags-I mean, these little lovely ladies-are obviously here to eat. So let's sell 'em- I mean, serve them some delicious Krabby Patties!
Krabs, my lady.
'Course ya did, because you're about to find out. SpongeBob!
Who are you with your tight lips, raised eyebrows, and conservative clothes?
What the...!
Ah, it don't matter anyway, lad.  She can't close us down.
She closed us down! I'm ruined!  Curse ye! How did it come to this?
Well, I didn't know her husband was the chief of police!
It's no use!  I'm ruined!
That's it! A secret Krusty Krab.!  And I know just where to open it.
There ya are, Betsy! All good as new!
You know, lad, I can remember a time when people used to knock before entering someone else's home!
Oh, yeah...
Hey, Squidwart. You haven't seen any sign of... you know...  the cops! Have ya?
Okay, thanks. I'm gonna see what SpongeBob's doing.  Hey, SpongeBob! SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? What are you doing under the table?
There's an old saying, lad. What doesn't kill ya... usually succeeds in the second attempt.
Nothing! But if don't get out there and start cooking, I'll make ya start taking weekends off!
Oh, Ms. Gristlepuss! I'm sorry we sold Krabby Patties. But do you really have to send us to jail?
Here's me little money maker.  Are you gonna make me lots of money today?
Ah, if only there are two of you...what? One, two? There's two?! He looks like you. He smells like you. He tastes like you! Is he a hard worker, just like you?
Well, is he!
You've got the job!
Money?  Burning?!  SpongeBob? Who's responsible for this?
You're on probation, boy!
SpongeBob! What's the meaning of this? Your station looks horrible. Take some pride in your work, boy! Look at your cousin Stanley, for example. Spiffing up his workplace with meaningful photos of the customers!
Yes, boy?
Yes, yes. The one I hired entirely on your recommendation. Hurry up, boy.
What? You didn't lie to me just so your cousin could get the job, did ya?
Well, good. Because there are plenty of other relatives that got passed over for the job!
I even turned down my three adorable nephews.
They solve mysteries.  Now go solve the mystery of why you didn't get the job!
What in the name of Neptune is going on? Oh. You broke your spatula. That's a shame. I'll order a another one tomorrow,boy.
Wait a minute...I know the perfect job for you!
Ah, it goes in like steel wool, but comes out like an angel from heaven.
Ooh, well, this one time I...
I didn't think so. Ooh wait, I almost forgot me coupons!  There's a couple double ones in there too.
What does that mean?
No, wait! I'll take 'em.
Come to papa! Come to papa!  Yay! Two nickels.  Hey, that's SpongeBob out there!  What in blue blazes is that boy up to?  Well I'll be a geriatric jellyfish! SpongeBob found a penny! A bright shiny penny just sitting there, and he picked it right up! Huh, I can remember the whole thing as if it just happened a moment ago.
What?
Ooh, I am?
Interesting how things work out that way. Some folks just walk along and stumble over free money, while others, others, they work!
I mean why couldn't I have just walked along and found it? I have legs too you know!  How about a little music.  Okay, okay, get a grip Krabs. Just concentrate on driving.  Okay, getting all worked up over a little coin.  Ah, it must just be the full moon. Wait a second.  I gotta have that penny!  Good morning, SpongeBob.
Find anything special lately?
Really?
And you want to share it with your old uncle Krabs, don't you boy?
Great! Well, share it with me!
Wha.. What?
Hello, SpongeBob.
Can I borrow a penny?
But did you check all your pockets?
Front pockets?
Back?
Shirt pockets?
Shoe pockets?
It is?
Hey, maybe it fell in your sock.
Did you check there?  Uhh?
Uhh?
So, uhh, no penny, huh?
Darn!
Careful with those marquee ladders!
Yes I did.
And you're just in time for the grand opening!  Step right up folks, and witness a spell binding tale chock full of adventure, and action, and thrills...
...witness the terrifying challenges overcome by... by...
by a... by a plucky young sponge.
That's right! And the best part is: admission is only one penny!
Uhh, well, actually I was going to show you this flip book and...
No, wait. Noooooooo!
Of course you can lad! You just gotta give me one penny.
But what?
Hello, and welcome to a very important evening. Tonight's event is entitled: Pennies, for the penny-less. And before the following images are shown, I would ask each of you to look not look with your eyes, but with your heart.  Three dimes, two nickels, one quarter, zero pennies. And since I realize the images seen here tonight may be wretchedly hideous, I am going to tell you what you can do to end this travesty: You can donate one penny to me: Mr. Krabs. Also known as: Mr. Krabs, the man who doesn't have one.
Yes?
You would?
Hiding it, somewhere. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it. Hiding it.
What's that? You! You know where!
Tell where!
Hiding it, inside,  in there, somewhere.
SpongeBob, I just wanted that penny you found on the street yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry.
It wasn't?
Ah ha ha ha ha hooooooooo hoo. I fell so relieved. There was no penny after all! Well, I'll be going now, You can keep the metal detector, SpongeBob. See ya!
Penny, must have buried it around here somewhere. I'll just have to keep digging.
Hmm... I just don't get it. If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, what will?!  Squidward!
There's gonna be some changes around here.  A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab!  SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up.
Yeah!  Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month.  We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers.  Do you lubbers have any ideas?
Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment.
The money?
Little Pearly... a star?
Squidward, you've got a deal. Make my little girl a star!
Hooray! My little girl is finally a star.
That's what I call talent!
Nice try. Your act's over, bub.
Squidward!  This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!
For your sake, I hope you're right.
You did it, Squidward! What a great show!
I'll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week's show!
Please deposit 25 cents to continue this call.
Code blue?!  What's the matter boy?
Man alive!  He's taking us down!
Brace yourself!  Huh?  Plankton's destroying the Chum Bucket? Heh, heh, I guess he's finally given up on the restaurant business. Couldn't take the competition.  What is that?
I agree, it's very suspicious. And he may have lured a few of our fair-weather customers in with some cheap entertainment, but our loyal customers, know quality when they taste it! So let's get in there, and serve 'em up a burger they tell their grand-guppies about!  Where's all my loyal customers?
That lower life form can slender my name, and desecrate me mother's grave,
.....but when he steals me customers, then I push back! Gentlemen, to the coliseum!  This reeks of evil. And i'm going to sniff out the source.
Mom!
Exactly!
You know I'm not one to give out comments likely, I've gotta hand it to you boy,  if you didn't throw those sausages into the audience, we would have been dead meat!
I think that it's safe to say, that no matter how diabolical Plankton's plans may be, he'll never have the loyalty, of me good customers.
But of course, my good customer. That'll be ten dollars.
Ahem, perhaps you'd like to speak to our financial expert.
Thanks for your business.
SpongeBob, what are you doing sitting around? We need Krabby Patties out there.
Eh?  Wow, that's all it takes these days, huh? Can you do more?  Oh, my! It's like printing money!
Never?
Wait, where're you going?  SpongeBob! What are you doing back here? Do you expect the customers to eat this? And now, thanks to you, they're leaving in boat loads.
No, boy, you're missing the point. You can't make Krabby Patties with ink and paper. You gotta put your heart in it, boy. Now get back to making them patties the right way and stop acting so dull.
Well, till you decide to start making them patties the way only you can I want you out of my place!
Sheesh. Calm down, boy.
It was National No SpongeBob Day.
Yeah. A whole day dedicated to getting away from you.
Uhh... yeah well... we kinda milked it a little.
Aww, cheer up, boy. It's a whole day inspired by you.
Of course.  First we build a giant wooden effigy of you, then we burn it to the ground.  Whoo-hoo!! Burn, baby!  And dance on the ashes like there was no tomorrow.
I suppose you can have the honor today, lad.
These quarters smell sad. You're not planning on getting a refill with them, are ya?!
What's that?
Behind your back?
Put your hat on, boy! Show some company pride!
Uh, SpongeBob?
Have you always had three legs?
Interesting... Well, what's this about a splinter that Squidward's been telling me all about?  All right, boy, let's see it.  Come on, SpongeBob, it's just a little splinter. I mean, how bad could it...?  Oh, merciful Neptune!  Okay, no problem. No problem.  Problem sol...  Whew. For a second there, I thought I was gonna have to pay you workman's "compersation."
You know, when you get paid for sitting at home.
Yeah, what do ya think "compersation" stands for?
Uh, Squidward?
No. Sorry, Squidward, your shift ended over two minutes ago.
Well, Plankton finally got what he deserved.
Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?
No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!
Arr, mutiny!
I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.
Who knows? I think you knows!
SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private.  You won't mind if I set this here, will you?
He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...
He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you.  Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.
Uhh... suit yourself.
Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight.  Or maybe scallops will fly out of my pants!  Hold on there laddie, I'm a-comin!
Listen up!
He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got!  You too, boy!
Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!
Well, maybe on a discount.
There ya are!
What the barnacles do you think you're doing?! You're chasing away all me customers!
What? Why, I got a good mind to...
Oh, that new honker of his has turned him into a complete jerk!
I've asked you all here, because we all face a similar problem. The problem, a sea star with a nose that's gotten way out of hand.  Now what I want to know is, are we going to do something about it?
Not now boy! We're in the middle of a public lishen! That no good, nose flartin...
Ata' boy! Now for the moment of truth!
Pull up a seat boy.
Sit, down!  Now you've worked here for quite some time, boy.
That said fact aside, midway through today's lunch rush, we ran out of, the secret ingredient  to the secret formula!
Listen up boy, any minute now, a truck driver is going to arrive, and i'm entrusting you to retrieve the secret ingredient! And I need you to do this with out any foulups! Understand?
It's time!  Now go! And make sure to guard it with your life!
Wait!
If something happens to that secret ingredient, don't bother coming back to work!
SpongeBob!  What are you doing lolly gagging about? Get back to work!
Hop to it! There's a lot of hungry customers out there!
SpongeBob, you were in charge of guarding that secret ingredient with your life!
Well, do you have any leads, or clues?
That would be... you, SpongeBob! You stole me secret ingredient!
That's right. And I know exactly how you carried out this little caper.  You obviously set up a decoy to take the delivery. Then when no one was looking, you swooped in, stole the secret ingredient, and spirited it away to the Chum Bucket,  where you sold it to Plankton to make a quick buck.  Don't talk! You can tell it to the cops, 'cause I'm calling them right now!
Then arrest this thief, Officer!
Uh, what are you talking about, SpongeBob? I'm not holding any secret ingredient.
Well, I wouldn't call it stealing...
I can explain!
It's simple, $1.99 is a lot to pay for the secret ingredient every time I get a delivery, so I s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s... took it to avoid paying, you know.
What? What'd I do?
Your honor.
Give away me Patties for free? Oh no, I couldn't bear the sight of that.
Rolling, rolling rolling. Money keeps on rolling.  One more time!  No way, Plankton! You're not getting me formula this time, or any time!
What are you talking about?
You're really funny man! You think you can compete with me? Look Plankton, look at all these loyal customers. Loyal to me, not to you!
Oh no! How can this be? Boy, front and center!
Plankton's trying to overthrow me business! He's got a customer that actually likes his food! You've gotta get that guy back on our side, with a couple of Krabby Patties.
Why go to the Chum Bucket, when the Krusty Krab is adding tasty Chum to our menu?
But we've developed a special recipe for the most discerning Chum lovers. Besides, I locked all the exits until you give it a try. So what do you say?  You like it?
Yeah?
Well, what do you think?
What am I going to do? I can't let Plankton have as much as one single customer!  I just can't afford it.
But to do that, I'd have to know how Plankton makes his Chum.  That's it boyo!  Where could it be?  There! Plankton's secret formula.  It's gotta be in here
Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing. You see, crabs are not born with an innate inkling of irony.
Look at all that loot!
D'oh, just put me out of me misery!
What? And miss this? I've never enjoyed me self more! This irony is pretty good stuff.
How's it looking out there, boy?
I ain't interested in same old regulars, SpongeBob! So I took out an ad in the Bikini Bottom Examiner to bring in some new customers! Twas a bargain too.  Only cost me a nickel. So tell me now, boy. How many new customers we got out there so far?
WHAT? What do you mean none? Don't these people read the paper?  Oooh, this thing hasn't been touched in months.  While that paper's selling like Krabby Patties. Uh, pardon me, sir. Could I interest you in a copy of the Examiner, this fine day?
"Fishboy Strikes Again?"  Wait a minute, aren't these stories a little less than truthful?
Yes, they certainly are.  Please, allow me.
No, thank you.  Now let's see how much they charge for advertising.  25 PER WORD! The newspaper business sure is easy money!  That gives me an idea!
Off of your duff, boy. You think I spent all last night assembling this printing press, so you could laze around all day? From now on you'll be twice as busy. And I expect you to wear 2 hats. 'Cause along with your usual fry cooking duties, you're my new lead reporter for the new !
That's right boy! And here's your very own camera! So you'll need it to document all them juicy stories you're gonna write. Now what are you waiting for, boy?
What a money-tastical day! Eh, Mr. Squidward?
: I'm excited about all the newspaper sales, too.
: What do you mean we haven't sold any newspapers? Certainly this gentlemen would like a copy of the .
: Too boring?    What's the meaning of this?
: "Local Resident Watches Pole?" No ones gonna pay to read this malarkey! When you write these stories, you've gotta use a little imagination, boy.
: Yeah. Maybe instead of "Man Watches Pole," you could say something like... oh... "Man Marries Pole." Then you can alter the photo a little to fit the headline and, see?  Now that's a juicy story!
: Don't think of it as lying, boy. Think of it as... uh... a practical joke. You know. Something everybody can have a good laugh about. The public expects a little embellishment here and there, so I want you to go out there, and get me a lead story that'll sell!
: "Boating Teacher in High Speed Chase!" I think you finally done it, boy! You've given me a story that'll sell! And sell it has!
: That's called editorial privilege, son. It gives you that extra oomph to move units. Besides, how could such a little news story, possibly affect Mrs. Puff in any way?
: Thanks for your business, and here's your paper.
: Make it quick, boy. These papers are selling faster then we can print 'em!
: Well, they're certainly doing me some good.  Can you believe it? Look at all this loot!
: Ah, you just don't get it, do you boy? We're not hurting anyone. We're just making their lives interesting, for everybody else.  Now get out there, and fetch another story!
: You're reaching new levels of imagination, boy-o!
: What's wrong. boy? You sick or something?
: Don't be silly, boy! We're a success!
: Oh, baloney! You better start feeling right! 'Cause if you don't, you can just kiss your spatular goodbye!
: Oh, darn tootin' I would! Now get out there, and bring me a juicy one!
: You've really outdone yourself this time!
: Come on, that's a bunch of hooey!
: People want wild juicy stories! That's what sells! Now I want your little yellow noggin, to come up with the wildest story ever! One that'll top all the others!
: Surprise me! Give me a shocker!  Good night boy. I'll check on you tomorrow morning. And remember, the wildest story ever!
: How's it going, lad?
: Excellent! We're gonna sell out in no time! We'll have to do another printing.  Huh?
: What's going on?
:  "Krabs Overworks Employees? Reaps Reward? Krabby Kronicle mastermind behind bogus stories pays his tired, under-age reporter pennies while he rakes in the dough?!?"
No! AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!
How can I be okay when me money's gone?! All gone!  It just goes to show, trying to make an easy buck doesn't pay.  Or does it?  Get me some scissors, boy-o! It's time to use  imagination!

A man works hard all week to keep his pants off all weekend.
You make Corn Crunch come out me nose!
Look, I'll stay upstairs in me room and not interrupt.

Good night, sweetie.

OK, you could have your allowance early.
See, you put it on the crackers  and a mamma mia you got-a one-a spicy pizza pie-a.
Okay, okay, I'm going.

And the most important one in all, no boys allowed!  Isn't it glorious?  Sweetie, you accidentally locked the door!
This is mutiny!
Open this door or Ill...
Whaddya say, boy?
Maybe I should just sleep under the highway.

Uh, SpongeBob, do you know anything about girls?
Look what theyre doing to that mans house!
Quiet, boy!
Turn it off! Turn it off, I cant take it!
Isaidturn it off!

Ooh look, thisll be fun to destroy!  Whee!  Now do you get it, boy?
Thats what teenagers do! Do you want this to happen to my house?
Then get into Pearls party and find out what theyre doing!
Who the heck is that?
You are one-of-a-kind, boy.
SpongeBob, tell em its from me!
Right, boy!
Whats taking SpongeBob so long? Im getting tired of looking through his stuff.
Hello?  Pizza!
I know, son.
And its ice cold, too. You should have been back here in 30 minutes or less!
You get into that party, or youre fired!
What in Neptunes toupee is going on here?  Me knick-knacks!  Me root beer!  Me pile of old newspapers!  I was maybe gonna read that someday!  I knew I shouldnt have trusted you!
SpongeBob?!
Cost me what?
Nooo!
Youre welcome, sweetie!  Oh, this is so expensive!
No, SpongeBob, that doesnt cheer me up at all.
Were you talking to me, Squidward?
Good word, boy! Don't sneak up on me like that.
You're not wearing shoes, lad. You're not going Section 8 on me, are ya?
Melted off?
Huh?
Of course not! Here. Just fan yourself with some of this junk mail I keep finding in me mail box.
That reminds me. Where are all me customers?
Could you be a little more specific?
Boys, I forgot to tell ya! Close up shop. We're going to the beach today!
Ahoy there!
My name is Eugene Krabs and I would like to know if I could interest either one of you in a fresh, delicious...
Krabby Patty, fresh off the grill!
Yes! Today, they're only three dollars! Each.
Either you buy a Patty, or get off me wave!
Hey, there, young feller! How'd you like to be our first customer in over seventeen working days?
Squidward, show him the menu.
Careful! You're gonna capsize us!
Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!  Aaaaahhhhhh!
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Wha? Where'd the beach go? These waters are calm. Too calm.  Dark sky.  Water spouts.... of blood.  Jelly donuts falling from the sky. What could this mean? There's only one logical answer. I've landed right in the middle of Dutchman's Triangle. Right above Davy Jones' Locker. In the Devil's Galley.
Locust. Culinary! Oh.  Look, Cashy!  Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesnt appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy?
Arrrgh! It's the Flying Dutchman!
Well, there ain't no use crying over it.  Yah! Don't worry, Cashy! Ill protect ye!
Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman! I didn't mean to spill your groceries!
No, I...  Cashy! Please! Cashy is the closest thing to a friend I've ever had!
Please! Please, Mr. Dutchman! Let Cashy go! I promise I'll never soil your waters again!
Oh, yes. I promise on my dear Aunt Sally's false teeth.
What?
How do you know?
No!!
Uh... where is that, exactly?
Oh, all alone again.  Cashy!
You like it when I comb your hair, don't ya, Cashy?
Who said that?
And Cashy!  CASHY!!
Cashy!
Excuse me sir, is this man giving you trouble?
We dont want any trouble, now just keep moving.
Sorry about that, SpongeBob. Wont happen again.
Say, that reminds mecan I have some money?
Dont be late for work tomorrow, boy.
Huh?
Mother of pearl!
Free?! Gimme, gimme, gimme!  Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!  Gimme. Gimme. Gimme?  Uhh... what do I get?
Big deal.
Million... dollars... cash prize?!  Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money! Money, money...   Money... money... money.  Money?
Ohhhhhh.
No living soul should have to suffer through what I've witnessed here today. Except maybe...
Now go get them!
What? Those two? Ah, they're harmless. It's all just part of the act.
Of course. They're just pretending.
Don't we all?
Eh... sure.
Ohh, fine.  You're the, uh, Short Order Boy,  and he's the... um, well, uh, Pink Patty.
The Krusty Krushers. Now go out there and wrestle me up a million dollars!
You can do it!
Oh, did I need something? Hmm, let me think. Did I need something?  Yes, I need something! I need you 2 to get back in there and show them who's boss! Show them what Short Order Boy and Pink Patty can really do!
That's the million dollar winning spirit.
Oh. Heh heh. Now what?
What are you doing out there?!
Okay, but you still have to try to win in fake wrestling.
Actually...  It doesn't!  Okay, okay, look. Just...  Hey, where'd they...  Oh, no! Not the...
End it?!
Get up! Get up, you guys!
C'mon, c'mon, wake up!
Oh, who am I kidding? Goodbye, money.
Goodbye, money.
Goodbye, mon- ... new champions?
Hello, money!  Woo-hoo! Money, sweet money.
Or?
Curtain Number 2?
Like we're really gonna turn all this money for...
Huh?  Oh. Ahoy, SpongeBob!
Okay, that's over with, Now why don't you go see if First Mate Squidward needs any help at the register?
Well, I was gonna wait til this afternoon, but I guess I could show you now.
I sure am.
Anyway, we got new beverage cups.
There's Regular, Large, and the new Viking Size!
SpongeBob, this promotion is designed to save US money. Now, don't forget. Each participating patron who purchases any drink in our new Krusty Krab Viking Size cup gets to a chance to try on this genuine cardboard Viking helmet.
Don't you know when you're being ignored?
Not so fast! Access to the mighty helmet will be granted to active promotion participants only. And only those who purchase Viking Size.
Oh, well, uh... the Vikings lived a long time ago.
Oh, I, uh, about ten years.
Uh.....  You're gonna have to ask Squidward any more questions ya got. He's the smart one.
Hey, I'm expecting a fifty cent rebate check. Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie.
Oh, a correspondence in a bottle, eh?  Ahoy, Eugene. I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard!  Grandpa Readbeard comin bla, bla, bla!
Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates. Gramps used to say, "The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws." And he wanted me to be a pirate, too.
So I bought me a ship, hired a crew.....
And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate. And booty did abound.
I started to notice a recurring fee. I just wasn't turning enough profit. So I fired me crew and sold me ship. Twas also the last time I saw me granddad.
For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship. If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart. Boo-hoo!
Hm. Not a bad idea, boy. But we're gonna need a first rate crew.
Yeah.
All right, me hearties! Get this one thing clear. If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew. Which means, I want you to look like a pirate.  I want you to talk like a pirate.
But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate.  Very convincing, Patrick. And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship! Now, let's get this restaurant ready to sail!
Way to go, fellars.
He's comin'!
Hide me, boy.
Oh, I...Heh, heh. So, have ya met me hearties?
Oh.
Indeed, indeed. And just look at the treacherous surf in our path!
Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it.
I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters. Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad? I said, "Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!"
There it is! That wind storm I mentioned earlier, it...and, aparrently me cabin is haunted as well.
Uh, just a sec.  Look out, Grandpa! We're under attack!
Not to worry, Granddad.
Yaahh! Uh... good toss, eh, Granddad?
Oh, nothing. Look!
Clear!
Sounds like we got a prize.  Ready, Squidward?
Ar! Take that, ya, ya scurvy dog! Woo! Check the size of this, Granddad. Check the... Granddad?
Oh no. If Granddad sees something, it must be the real deal.
What exactly are we dealin' with, Grandpa?
Oh, so depulsive.
Go get it, Granddad.
Wait a minute. What kinda disgusting, horrible abomination is dare invade me vessel?
That disgusting, horrible thing is me daughter!
Nooooo!
Oh, I, oh, I was just checkin' the cannon and makin' sure it was loaded.
I can explain.
Don't worry! I have it under control!
Pearl! Could ya pipe down? Your Great-Granddad Redbeard is in there!
What? Oh, never mind that!  Just go home.
I bet you're wondering about that.
Do you mind?
Just a second.
Now, Granddad. There's a simple explanation.
Of course I do, Granddad.
It's, it's, it's a pirate never lies!  And I've been a dirty liar! Everything you see is a lie! This sail is a lie!  This crew is a lie!  Even the ship is a lie!  All of it! All a lie!
You see, Granddad? I'm no pirate. I'm just a lowly restaurant owner! I'm sorry I failed ye.
Really? Thanks, Granddad!
Goodbye, Granddad! What an honest man!
I knew I got me talent from someone!
What are you talking about?
Bleh!
Well... it's almost quittin' time, Squidward. You... got any big plans for after work? .
What's going on here?!
Get to work.
Oh boy.
What are you two doing?! Get to work! I'm used to Squidward sleeping on the job, but I expect more from you, Mr. SquarePants.
What in the name of Davy Jones are you talking about?
Yeah, so?
Who told you that?
Well, why don't you just take them off?
Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.
SpongeBob, it's Mr. Krabs. I've been looking all over for you. You're three hours late for work!  Hello?
SpongeBob, are you sure you're feeling shipshape?
Babies?
Let me see.
Yeah, come on, let me see them. I like babies.
Hey there, little critters.  Come to...
Get that disgusting vermin out of me restaurant, pronto!  Blech!
Did you say "fortune?"   $5.99, that's right. Get them while they last. Don't be shy, folks.
Well, it's like they always say back in the old country, lad.
I don't know. I've never been to the old country!
Okay boy, get out there.
Battle stations men!!! Here he comes!
Four hundred and fifty-one, four hundred and fifty-two, four hundred and fifty three, four hundred and fifty four, four hundred and fifty five, four hundred and fifty si...  Ow! No!  Ooh.  I split me nail. Oh, that looks terrible.  Hello? It's an emergency! No, I haven't been biting them!  No! Can you just schedule me in?  Now? A manicure right in the middle of the day?  But what if the guys see me?  Yes, I want my nails to look their best. Be right there.
Uh. Heh heh. It's a... it's a secret.
Everybody has a secret, SpongeBob, and mine's gonna take 15 minutes.  Maybe 20 if she can spruce up my cubicles.
Eh,  well, not Squidward. [ No, no, him.  Too lumpy.  Okay, okay, you're in charge.
You're in charge for the next 15 minutes.
Yeah, sure, why not?  You okay, boy?
What a sheesh. I'll be back in 15 minutes
Ah, there's nothing like polished pincers to make you feel like a man!  Let's see how SpongeBob's doing as acting manager.  What the...??!! SpongeBob dancing like a goofball?
Me customers cowering in fear?
The Krusty Krab a filthy mess?
And some stranger cooking Krabby Patties??!!  Squidward sleeping on the job??!! Ok, that's actually normal. SpongeBob! What have ye done to me Krusty Krab!
All my secrets...?  So, is there anything else I can do for you, acting manager SpongeBob?  Ah, Gwenevere!!!
Oh, how do you put this thing together?
Boy?
I've got a special assignment for you. This is a build-it-yourself telescope. The only problem is, I can't figure out how to put the darn thing together. That's where you come in.
Now read this cover-to-cover, and be prepared to put this together at me house tonight.
That's not gonna be a problem, is it?
Excellent! Because I was looking at your annual employee report card... ...and it appears the "Does Laborious Task for Supervisor" box is unchecked. See ya tonight!
SpongeBob! I knew I wouldn't have to fire ya!
Really... Why don't you go into town and pick up one of those hex drill thingies.
Or you could sit there and watch me fill out your employee report card...
I was just looking at your employee report card...
What happened to your clothes, boy?
Boy? Hold on, boy, you're supposed to be using that motorized hex drill! Now, where is it?
Patrick's rock? Whatcha do with it there?  SpongeBob, wait! Get back here, boy!
Your little assistant? That's my little assistant you're talking to! What's going on here!?!
Hey, SpongeBob was supposed to bring that to me!
Yeah, you should've said something.
Whoa, whoa, that's enough, lad. What do ya think, I'm made of ketchup? Now run along, boy.  That sounds like... a band of roaming tourists.  Wait, come back! Don't ya wanna give me your money?! They're a slippery bunch. What do I have to do to catch 'em, stand around out here all day?  What are you doing there, Patrick?
How would you like a job, Patrick?
You'll get your hat, but first you have to entice people into the restaurant by standin' right here and holdin' this sign.  That's not too tough for ya, is it boy?
Perfect. You'll be wearin' that hat in no time at all.  Hee hee hee.
You're buddy Patrick. I hired him to stand out there and hold that sign.
And look. He's about reel in his first customer.
What does he think he's doing?!  They're walkin' right past him.  Patrick, you need to get their attention, boy.
That ain't the kind of attention we need! Why don't you show a little razzle-dazzle, maybe give the sign a little twirl or something.  Just keep workin' on that one, eh boy? Listen, if any tourists come by, why don't you blow them away with a little extra twirl.
That's enough Patrick!
I saw it.
Ehhh... what the heck. It pays to advertise.
SpongeBob, what's wrong with him?
You mean, CASH money?!
Five dollars please. Alright.
There's that sound again. They're loving it. Patrick, you've captured the attention of all these tourists with your ridiculous blackdoodle.
That's right, I think we've finally found a job for you that you're good at. Being an absolute buffoon! If it's folly you crave, it can be found exclusively at the Krusty Krab. For just five dollars a head.
What the barnacles is going on out here?
We've got all the entertainment we need, thank you very much!  Hey, where'd he go?
What's with him?
A bloody nose, eh? Do ya think I was born yesterday? He doesn't even have a nose. Now everybody, get back to work! I'm Not Running A Happy Factory Here  keep up the good work, Patrick!
Hey! What's going on?
You want excitement? Well, what if I added a box?
Well, what if he fell from two boxes...?  ...into cream pie?
Okay, let er rip!  I'll be in the back counting me money. If the crowd gets bored, add some more boxes!
SEE THE PART TIME MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYEE FALL ATOP THIS TOWER INTO THIS BUCKET OF SPINY SEA URCHINS!
It's OK, boy, he signed a waiver.  Is he ready, Mr Squidward?
OK! Get back, boy, you wouldnt want to stain your uniform.
Ready, Patrick?
Come on, Patrick! We've got a perfectly good bucket of spiny sea urchins down here!
Stuck? Well if that don't   What's the hold up, Mr. Squidward?
Patrick, why have you stopped falling?
Well you'd better figure it out. These people paid good money for a floor show full of pain and humiliation. Now make with the cods-wallop, pal, understand?
Don't make me come back here.
I don't think so.
Thank you.
Sorry, absolutely no refunds.  Hold on there, what's the big idea?  Grandma, help!  All right, you leave me no choice.
Not even close, you're fired. As long as I'm still standing, you will never wear this hat again!
Hey boy, what's with all that snivelin'?
Well, I just, uh, well never mind that, boy. What's your problem?
There, there, boy. There, there. It's not that bad. I'm sure you'll thinka something.
Well, I'd be honored to help you and your snivelin' snail during such desperate times. I love helping others. Like helping meself Now, how much ya got?
Oh. I see
Only if I get to cut your health benefit for ya.
SpongeBob me boy, I need to borrow a blanket.
Thanks, boy-o. Now I'm all toasty.
Only two customers? Customers are looking kinda scarce. . Must be low tide or something, eh Squidward?
The Chum Bucket?  "Chum...is...Fum?" SpongeBob!
SpongeBob, we have a situation.
SpongeBob, I'm afraid our worst fears have been realized.
No.
A few hours ago, the Chum Bucket was, as it should be, a desolate no-man's land.  There's only one way he could have changed things around so quickly.  Plankton must have slipped into the Krusty Krab while you weren't looking.
He stole the Formuler.
I thought you'd say that.  So we need to infiltrate the Chum Bucket and steal the formular back.
SpongeBob, how you holding up boy?
Hold on now. We're almost there.
We made it SpongeBob. We're in!
Keep an eye peeled for anything suspiciourous
Eh...BINGO! Giddy up boy, We're almost there.
No, uh  I'm full thanks!
Huh? Well he obviously didn't steal me formular, but how did he steal all my customers?
Come on SpongeBob...
Yep.  Keep up the good work boy'o!
Don't cry, love. Daddy's going to make it all right. Calm down, girl!
Her scurvy prom date stood her up, boy, and now she can't seem to find another.
No, no baby, no more crying. We'll get you a date. Why, uhh... I'll take you!  Well, what about Squidward?
Wait, wait. Here, take SpongeBob!
What do you mean?
Yeah, they would. We've got to find someone else. Listen up! Which one of you lucky lubbers wants to take me lovely daughter Pearl to the prom?
Now listen boy, I'm-a counting on you to make this a very special night for a very special girl. Remember, you're doing it for good old Mr...
Never mind that, boy! You're taking Pearl to her prom!
Hello?  What do you think Pearl? Cleans up pretty well, doesn't he?
Go easy on him, lassie! I can't afford to break in a new fry cook!
A-ha! Keep away from me precious little flower!  You almost stepped on it.
Good job, laddie.
Take a seat, boy.
Today's a big a day for The Krusty Krab.  So I want yous to listen up.  It's a perfect opportunity for Plankton to try and steal the Krabby Patty formula.
No. It's a holographic projection of The Krusty Krab. I want you two to watch all the entrances.
Those are just the ones on the surface.  There is an entire network of tunnels and air ducts underground and I want all eyes on the look out!
Right. Study the map, stay extra vigilant. Don't fall asleep on the job. That means you, Squidward.
Don't make me have a flashback.
And to help watch out for Plankton, I've hired some  security.
What, you expect me to spend money on a real security guard? You are my first line of defense, Patrick. So, look out for any suspiciorous characters.
Plankton doesn't stand a chance.
Fore!
I'm tired today, Plankton.  You're just gonna have to launch yourself.
Now to add some special anniversary deals to the menu.  Krabby Patty... 20 bucks. 39 bucks. 30.  Oh, number zero, how I love you so.  SpongeBob!
I'm putting you in charge of decorations.
Yes, boy?
What? But you are.
Squidward! I had chores for you, but you won't do 'em anyway.
Here's your budget, boy.  Decorate it any way you want.
Well, you want want to do it, then?
Then shut your porthole.
Good work, boy. What, that's it?
Decorations, check. Security?
Check.
Okay, open your ears. These people have come from miles around because they love my patties. I want every employee on their best behavior.
So, let's get out there and sell some Krabby Patties!
Geez, boy.  This thing's enormous.
All right let's get this thing out of here. Me customers are waiting.
The door!
Somebody...
Everybody, calm down. I spent a lifetime working in this restaurant, and I know there's only one way out of here.
No,  the air duct.  This way boys.  All we have to do is head through this duct.
Uh, hmm, uh...
Well, according to the map, we just go straight, take a right between these three moldy tree stumps, then head towards that kidney-bean shaped pile of gravy.
Oh. All right,  then, let's try this one.
Hey, what's this?  It's an old Krabby Patty wrapper.  Aah, that takes me back to the good old days.
 Come on down and... 
Back then, Krabby Patties only cost a dime.  It was a dark and  evil time.  I still have nightmares.
Hey, I think  I see the exit.
Ah, barnacles. It's just the Surveillance Room.
Oh, uh... uh... uh...  I just want to make sure you all floss after ever meal.
We're  getting warm. I can feel it.
Hmm, a crossroads.  I'll go this way, and SpongeBob,  you lead them down that way.
SpongeBob, you've been working here for a while now, so I think I can trust you. It's time I told you.
Yes. The Krabby Patty formular. Follow me, son.  We need to go where no one will ever hear us.  Ugh. We finally made it.  Quick, get into me office before anyone sees us.
Now, remember, you can never tell another living soul.
What's that?
Plankton.  You'll never have get me formula.  Not even in a flashback.
Squidward, what's with the creepy smile?
What's the sound? Customers!
Oh, no. All that loose change out there  is driving me wallet mad with money lust.  Poor little guy's starving.  There you go, boy. You're free. Go towards the money boy. Towards the money!
Hey! Oh, no!  What am I going to do?  We gotta get out of here. Now!
What?
Worst play I've ever seen.  And a total rip-off!
Hey!
Come back with me money!
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
Yes.
I didn't make any money.
To concoct an elaborate escape plan?
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Oh, boy, we made it out!  Woo-hoo!  Money! Money! Money! Money!  Come on in folks.  No need to shove. Plenty of room for all your money! ay-yi... Oh! Where are all me customers?  They left.. with all their money?!
Money!
Me customers? They're coming back? SpongeBob's dopey little song is bringing 'em back.
Ah, 'tis a beautiful sight. It warms me heart.  Me Krabby Patty recipe! What's it  doin' out here? Whoa-ho! Shoulda known! Plankton.
It's launchin' time.
Oh, all right. Since I'm is such a good mood, I'll go easy on you this time.  There.  Happy landings, Plankton!
Stay away from the high-tension wires.  Allow me to open the door for a valued customer.
Wow, that's some coincidence 'cause I just lost one earlier today with 50 bu...! Hey, wait a minute! Come back with me wallet, ya thieving bilge rat!
And good riddance! Next time, you should read our sign about the mandatory side of fries policy!  Lookie, another flat-eyed, bushy-tailed customer!
stop spending money here? Well, don't worry, I'm certainly not going to keep you from doing what you want. Give him a Krabby Patty with the works!
Oh, that's funny.
I'll think about that one while you buy a kelp soda.  Boy, you're doing it all wrong! Here, take this.  Now you can flip 2 patties at the same time; do twice the work!
genius? Perhaps. Or maybe I'm just a little off.
Me formula! Darn these flimsy nails! How am I supposed to hide me formula with this nonsense? Ah, well. It's the life I choose to live.
Where have you been, and what is that ridiculous thing on your head?
How dare you spend all the money I don't pay you at me arch-rival's business! Boy, Plankton's really cleaning up down there, which means it's time to start running into the ground.
I'm here to steal back me customers, with the savory flavor of the Krabby Patty!  Now, go get it!
Unethical? This is perfectly legit! I call all building rights under my restaurant!
Not if I bury you first!
We're trapped! Trapped, I tell you!
Plankton, I don't think you grasp the severity of our situation. We're trapped down here. As in, THERE IS NO WAY OUT!!!
Uh-huh. That's what I've been trying to tell you.  Comfort me!
Aw, look at us! Old, gray...
Say, Plankton, say we get out of here with out lives, let's agree to work together.
We have a deal. No more bickering.
Hang on a minute, don't you hear that?
Woo-hoo! You found us! I oughta pay you for this!
Hey, Plankton, we're free!
Where'd he go?
You better not be trying to steal me formula!
But what about our deal?
That's it. Just wait 'till I get me claws on your...
Satisfied with yourself, Plankton! Now you've trapped us all underground!
Capturing customers! I should've though of it sooner! But without Squidward, I need someone to work the register.
Oh she does, does she? I'll handle this, laddie.  Yes, Queen Amphitrite.  Very convincing, but you're gonna have to call pretty early to fool ol' Eugene Krabs, PRANKSTER! . They think I was born yesterday. Aye-aye-aye. Does 7:00 work for you, your majesty?  Oil up yer spatula boy, for tonight you fry for a king.
You two really outdid yourselves. It almost makes me want to pay you.  Oh, yeah.  Looks like this area could use a few more decorations. Squidward!
The decorations over here look a little sparse. Why don't you hang up a few balloons or something?
Oh, that's better. Looks lovely, Squidward. Excellent work. How goes it over here?
5,000 patties at $3.99 a pop?
Leave it to your old boss here to capitalize on such a momentous occasion.
This ain't for you, lad. This is for King Neptune. Today is his birthday.
Don't be ridiculous. Why in Neptune's name would I let you...
See Neptune eat! Only five dollars! Only a few seats left!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Nope, sorry. I guess that it's twenty dollars for for you then. Don't be shy folks. Seats are going fast.
Huh? Okay, who's ready for a piping hot Krabby Patty? Would you like the first one, your highness?
So who's going to pay for these, then?
Oh! If Neptune doesn't cheer up soon, me business is ruined.
Come on, Krabs! Think, think!  Ooh!
Squidward, you're a man of culture.
Well, these highfalutin' types, they might appreciate that, don't you think? Why don't you try and razzle-dazzle them with all your pizazz?
Ready for a room temperature Krabby Patty yet?
Neptune is inconsolable, if only there where something to distract him from his pain.
Great idea, go and play them another song.
What he say?
Please! I'll be ruined!
Neptune and friends wait! What about the party? What about me restaurant?
Squidward has his own TV show?
Eat at the Krusty Krab, home of the original Krabby Patty!  And remember, we change our grease monthly!
Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! We don't want just you! We want your money too!
The Krusty Krab! The Krusty Krab! Eat at the Krusty Krab!
Me dollar lies over the ocean, me dollar lies over--  Whoa! Blarney stone, that's a horrible reek. I knew I was forgetting somethin'.  Ohhhhhhh, bring back me money to me!
That's strange. I'm sure I can remember screwing the cap back on the toothpaste, but here it is on the edge of the sink, plain as day. Heh heh! These are strange times we're livin' in.
That sounded like me beloved teenage daughter, Pearl. I'm coming, princess!
Pearl! What in the name of Neptune's Aunt Nancy is with all this ruckus?
Pearl, this is terrible! I paid 30 bucks for that bed! 'Course, that was when you were a newborn. Maybe if I crunched a few numbers and checked the warranty, I couldPearl: I  need  food.
Okay, Pearl! I wasn't sure what to get, so I just brought the whole--
refrigerator.
Pearl, I somehow just realized what's happening.
You're havin' one of them, uh, you know, one of them, um, growth spouts. It means you're healthy.
Empty!
Darling, I searched the entire house. There's not a speck of food to be spoken of.
Uhhh, can't. It's late, and all the shops are closed. We're just gonna have to wait until morning to find you something to eat.
Eh? Where?
Me money?
No, wait! I'll think of something.  Food. Where? Where? Food. Where? Where? Huh?
Hehehehehe! Peanuts!  What the...  These peanut worms are pets, not vegetables!
Me money! What do you think yer doin'?  That ain't yours.  Thank you very much. When I get my hands on that boy...
Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today.  And don't even think about coming back here until that destructive device of yours is gone.
I'm puttin' the secret Krabby Patty formula out in plain sight.
Yeah... Anyway, I'm gonna leave it out here while I clean out the safe. Don't let it out of your sight, boy-o.
Oh, thank you Sandy. Thank you Sandy.
I told ya to stop playing with that thing and get back to work.
Need a little refresher, eh? Okay, boy. I'll run through the Krabby Patty formula one more time.
The secret of the Krabby Patty formula. Jackpot!
The secret to the Krabby Patty formula-
Hold on.
The secret to the Krabby Patty formula is...!
Is this thing loud enough? Oh, sure, I can hear you fine now. What was the question again?
Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner!  Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout.  There might be a new face on the wall this month.
Money, money, gonna make some money!  Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early!  Wait!
What's going on here?!
No!
Boys, boys, boys!  Help! Help!
Wait, you've got to pay for those! Wait, wait, wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! Boys, wait!
Squidward! What's all the hubberub?  SpongeBob! What's all the hubberub?
Grease slick, eeh?
That me boy, is a grease trap.
What?
Hmm.
Right behind there.  Alright. Let's get out of here!
Somethin' is terribly wrong, Squidward!
So I'm gonna go find  out what that rascal's up to!  Excuse me! Excuse me! Comin' through!  What the?  Try Plankton's... new delicerous... Chummy Patties... now with edible flavor?  Clearly somethin' crabby is goin' on here.
Save the formalities for your mother-in-law, Plankton! Yeh stole my Krabby Patty Formuler, and I want it back!
A gift?
Be that as it may, Plankton! It takes 2 to tango.
SpongeBob! Stop what you're doing!
Never mind that now, I've got some new directions for yeh. From now on, I want you to fry up  two Patties for every Krabby Patty we sell!  One for the patty itself, and the  second, just for the grease! Then,  slather the grease from the second patty onto the first one and  Voalora! It's A deluxe Krabby Patty with extra flavor!
Unhealthy? Boy, didn't anybody tell yeh?
Questions are a danger to you...  and a burden to others.
Lil' lower! Lil' more! More! Lil' more! Okay, A little to the left now! Up a bit! Okay wait, that's too far. Alright, alright, perfect, right there!
Just hangin' a new sign, Squidward!
Shh! Okay, a little higher now!
Quadruple goodness?!  We'll see about that.  Keep the grill goin' nonstop to crank out as much grease as possible!
Uhh... I already see the...  Whoa!  Gribbets Mollusk!  Eeeagh! What in the name of Neptune is this?
Huh?
This is our latest product! It's pure grease on a paper plate!
SpongeBob! Get those seven orders of Wow soup out to table 3 pronto! We gotta keep these customers happy or Plankton will steal them back!
SpongeBob!
Are you gonna get that soup served to table 3 or are you gonna wait til it gets up and walks there itself?
You know what I think SpongeBob? I think you should be thinking about NOT thinking and get back to work!
Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?!
I guess this is it boy. The end of an era.
It is. Unless I can find a way to get this grease soaked up.
Oh what difference does it make?
Ah. It was all a dream!
Are you kidding? He's an absolute treasure to have around the restaurant!
And he's been with me for such a long time now.
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let the little guy go today.
Yeah, as much as I don't like doing it, I have to let him go.  Gotten too big for his cage.  Go on, little guy. Fly away. You'll be missed.
Afternoon, boy-o!
What was  about? Oh, probably just nonsense and babbling, as usual.
Ever so gently...
Boy, what are you going on about?!
All right, boy-o! I won't get rid of ya: on one condition.
Eh?  Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be hasty. Why didn't ya say you were buying your pet a Krabby Patty? Listen. Tell you what, for your troubles I'll give you two Krabby Patties at regular price.  SpongeBob, give this responsible pet owner two Krabby Patties.
Well well well, SpongeBob SquarePants. I was just about to re-tar the parking lot. Why don't you come help me, boy?
Oh, say no more. You go on home to your pet turtle or whatever.
Yeah, sure just come in five hours early tomorrow to finish up the parking lot.
What's that filthy animal doing in me kitchen?
Free... labor? Why didn't ya say so?  Serve em' up, snail!
Money back?!
What's the problem here?
Hm. And you'll like to upgrade to the toy package is that right?
Eww.  Disgusting. Ahem. yep it's pretty special all right. And it can be yours for only...
Hey, good looking.
Avast, there, laddies. What's all this ruckus about now?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, settle down. All this brawling is over a toy? You two shouldn't let a little trinkle between youse two. You should be ashamed of yourselves. If I give you each of ya another toy, would that make you happy?
Well, you're in luck! You two so thrilled with a toy. I'm have entire case e'made. I've been selling my hotcakes. That'll be $13.50 each.
SpongeBob!  Report to me office.
Now listen up, son. I called ye here on the official Krusty Krab business. Every year, me fellow cheapskate crabs meet and discuss new ways of being stinky in the workplace. But more than that, they bestow the award for Cheapest Krab. And this year,  I've been nominated!
So I'll be outta town for the awards ceremony. And yer coming with me.
Now, this trip... I'm gonna teach ye all the cheapskate knowledge like you were the son I've never wanted!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Maybe.
Ooh! No! Now, this'll be a great learning experience for you, so keep yer brain peeled!
And in the tradition of the event, we are required to travel cheaply, and I'm gonna teach ya the cheapest way to do it!
Attention cheapskate attendees! I, Eugene Krabs, have only spent on me travel, the price of a one-cent stamp!  Thank you! Thank you! I'd like to see someone top that!
Chintzy McGee?!
Come on.
You see that, laddie? That outstretched hand is one of the biggest dangers to becoming a true cheapskate:  He wants a tip.
It means he wants money for nothing.  So watch closely.  There ye are, lad.
Why, thank you!  Now watch closely, boy! You give it a little lean, and then... snatch it back!
Go ahead! Give it a try!
Go on boy! The quarter's getting away!
Quit foolin' around! I got an award to win!
Hi, fellers!
Of course.
I'd like to introduce me fellow fry cook, SpongeBob. I've been giving some pointers.
Lad, you're surrounded by stingy wisdom, so try to pick up some pointers. But whatever you do, don't lend anyone money.
Let's mangle.
Thank you, thank you!
Uh, geez. I didn't think the competition would be so stiff this year!  I'm gonna need your help on this one!
I need ya to testify about how cheap I am! So if you need to do a little exaggeratin'...  Ye not getting it, are ye?  Exaggeratin' is like tellin' the truth, only with little lies sprinkled in to make it, uh... true...er.
No, no, no, no, no, no, exaggeratin's completely different from lyin'. You're taking the truth, and just seasoning it with little lies. I mean, just because you put salt on a Krabby Patty... it doesn't make it a salty patty. Does it?
Well, good enough. Just make sure you exaggerate enough fer me to win!
Exaggerate!
No! About me being cheap!
No, no, no, no, exaggerate the other way!
Thanks.
But...but isn't that stealing?
Heh heh. Well, could we "exaggerate" this pillow, too?
Sure, boy! But why not "exaggerate" the whole wall?  Well, I didn't win the award, but it's been nice exaggeratin' with you, boy.
Heh heh heh. Looks like he bit off more than he could chew.
Thanks for ruinin' everything so I could win! Put er there, SpongeBob me boy!
SpongeBob, you're late! Why are you bright green, and what happened to your legs?
A ghost, eh? Can you still cook Krabby Patties?
Then get your Captain's Quarters in the kitchen!
Ewww.
Specials? We don't have specials!
Mr. Squidward, you're in a chipper mood this morning, did you get an order of fancy decorative soaps in the mail or somethin'?
I told you, there's no early-bird special, now stop calling me here-- Mother!
What?
Nice to have ya back Squidward.
Hmm.. Okay, uhhh. I suppose you could put it with the nacho cheese, no one's got near that in years.
Bikini Bottom Labor Regulations? Eewww! Gross!  Get that thing away from me! It's giving me hives!
Gahh! Blast you Squidward! You drive a hard bargain. I guess I could rustle something up for ya.
Oh! Here we go! Found it!
It's me old navy locker. Good as new!
uuhh.. Appears to be Corporal Sterling, lad. Heh...forgot all about that prank.  Squidward! Your locker is ready!
Now not so fast, Mr. Squidward, the law requires that all employees have a secure place for personal items. So you are required by law, to share.
Blimey! She hasn't sparkled like this since boot camp! Carry on boys.
I just sweet talked an old lady out of $20 for a Krabby Patty!
Private SpongeBob! Ahoy!
Why, SpongeBob, That's not your usual four-fingered salute.
Well, SpongeBob, I'd sure hate me customers to see you like this. Is there anything I can do to help?
Sure, why not?
Uh, you're not talking about the Shelly Superhighway, are ya?
Uh, well, 'cause I'm actually in favor of that highway being built.
Yes! I've already calculated how many new customers I'll get once it's finished. You can see fo yourself in this series of these charts and diagrams I have displayed!
What!!?? WHO APPROVED THIS PLAN!!??
C'mon, boy! Let's you and I go over and show that Plankton a piece of our minds!
Alright, Plankton! It's Eugene Krabs, here, with, What's-His-Name! Now c'mon out!
C'mon outside, and take what's coming to ya!
Oh, sorry.
Don't play coy with us, Shelly. We both know you've been up to no good. Now start talking.
What? You've been what?
Wait a minute. You've been what?
I don't know.
And I like saying, "aye."
Oh, why did I say "aye"?
Well, I'm gonna do the only thing I can do when me character is tested by insurmountable odds: lie on me back and sob loudly.
I used to dream of me restaurant with "easy highway access!"
But Squidward, you can't leave! What if we have, a customer?
No, SpongeBob. Squidward's right.  It's high time we started accepting facts. [SpongeBob runs over to a fax machine and pulls out a new one]
No, boyo! Not that kind!
The Krusty Krab can't stay in business. Not like this.
No, SpongeBob. And its time to activate Plan Zed-9er9er.
Plan Zed-9er9er is, I'm- I'm- I'M SELLING THE KRABBY PATTY SECRET FORMULA TO PLANKTON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have no choice. And stop calling me Eugene.
Plankton, I'm ready to negoitiate a price for me secret formula.
What for?
What?
Up there!  Whoa, nelly!!!
You know something, Plankton? Maybe we can talk about this later. I think I'm just gonna run for me life.
Praise Neptune.
Hold on. Don't you want to hear my annual scary story?
Aye, the worst monster of them all.
True as the deep blue.
Have a seat, me boy.  Every year on Halloween night, the Flying Dutchman descends on Bikini Bottom, in a pirate ship, just like this.  Only bigger!
Like I was saying, The Flying Dutchman swoops down and starts stealing people's souls.
Aye, as a matter of fact, they do. And he puts them where you can never get them... in his soul bag.
Ah, Scaredy Pants gets easier to scare every year!
Nothing like a good ghost story, eh, me boy? Hope you're not too scared to come to me party tonight, SpongeBob ScaredyPants!
It's the real Flying Dutchman!
SpongeBob, guess what?  Yeah, I'll come back later.
Well, at least we're still together, little ones.
Hmmm... Quite a conundrum you have here. It will be a cryin' shame to a certain someone if the information were to leak out to the authorities
It's gonna cost a fortune to get this fixed. Thanks to you.
I think we can work something out
Err... interesting, I had something else in mind. Surprise SpongeBob! You got a new co-worker.
She'll be filling in for Squidward while he's...  ...on vacation! Isn't that right, Mrs. Puff?
She'll be workin unpaid until he returns. Won't she?
Squidward! I forgot to tell ya. You're taking a summer off! Have a good time! See ya!  Phew! That was close.
It certainly has. Now SpongeBob, would you please show Mrs. Puff her new duties vis-a-vis with her recently changed life? 'Cause I'm sure a snail can't be bothered to do it.
What are you doing yelling at me customers? The duke here is one of me regulars, and I don't need to explain what happens when you start losing your regularity, do I?
Just don't let it happen again, Puff.
Ahh, that's the stuff.  Hey, something don't smell right. SpongeBob! Hey, what are you burning out here, boy?
Explosive!?
Plankton! I just had that roof redone last week!
Ready for instant?  Fire!  Take cover!  Oh, ha, ha, it didn't blow up another dud, Plankton.
Well you ain't getting it.
Oh, go jump off a plank.
Ha ha ha ha!
Errrrrrrr...
She's a big girl Plankton, I have no control over what she does. Oh, And you better watch out. I think she's extra hungry today.
Who knew Plankton was so afraid of whales?  Pearl me darling daughter, you saved my business and my Formular now get us out of this trap.
Alright, alright. You're gettin' more like your old man every day. . Pearl, why don't you swing to the Chum Bucket on your way to the mall? Give Plankton a little scare?
Alright, SpongeBob. It's your turn!
It's all catching up to me...  Please, Pearl?
Hmmm... in that case, I'll need to borrow one of your dressers.
Goodbye, Pipsqueak!
Really? He's a mess!
May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?
This is almost too fun!  Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!
Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes.  Boo!
I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean...  I'm Pearl, not Krabs.
Secret fear?  What are you talkin' about?
No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!
Whew! You really redeemed yourself boy!  Okay, you're beginning to creep me out.
Avast, there. What are you all happy about?
You, I'm used to. Why is he so happy?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Me customers come here for greasy food at high prices. Not for singin' and dancin'.
Of course.
Um, I suppose...
Really? How about four times as much?
Well...OK. But only on one condition: that you both keep workin'. Because if just one Krabby Patty is late, I'm shuttin' you down!
Oh, you. Oh, sure.
I love it!
And all of them willin' to work for no pay!
Please take your seats.
How much am I gettin' for this?
What did I tell you? You do your job, or I'm shuttin' you down!
Squidward...
Squidward! You get that customer a fresh patty with ketchup! Now! And don't forget to charge him again!
What's that, Mr. Squidward?
Oh, well, that's OK, then. But get him a Krabby Patty!
It's funny, 'cause it's true!
Squidward! You still haven't given me customers their Krabby Patties!
And for you?
Certainly.
Squidward! Squidward!
Good news. The play is such a success, I've added two more shows and a matinee! Break a leg tomorrow!
Ok, explain it to me again, but this time, take out anything that doesnt have to do with money. Uh-huh, thats what I thought.
' SpongeBob! Whats the meaning of this?
Where the devil are we?
Did we make any money?
: Goodness, no! Here you are
Well... You know... Unwinding. Enjoying the free parking.  What's happening to your little critter here?
Change? As in legal tender?
Wow. Shiver me shell wax. You're like a little money detecting... Uh... You know... A sneagle.
Thank you SpongeBob. How about you bring your sneagle into work with ye.
But that was before I knew that they had such an amazing talent.
I could.
There you go. Bring in that change. I've been working on that one for months. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr!
Uhh... SpongeBob. Shouldn't you be out back scrubbing the dumpster.
Then get back there and scrub the poop deck so to speak.
Anything on the floor gains.
Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Looks like I need pockets for me pockets! Ahh. Fine! With my new money finder... Who needs ya!Ahh. I was about to close up shop anyways.
You aren't taking him anywhere yet. You haven't greased the fryer yet.  Don't worry about Jerry. I'll make sure he gets his nightly craw.
Heh, heh. Excuse me mam.
Dirty money spends just like the clean.
You sure make easy work.
Yeah. But you still have work to do.
Yeah. How about you rearrange the wall rivets from smallest to largest.
That's what they want you to know. Now take a long look.
Now back to our treasure hunt. Eh, boy.
You okay, boy?
That a boy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. There's no stopping. There's a laundromat that needs to be cleaned out. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Cleaned out. Get it. Ahh. Never mind. MUSH!
If you don't get moving I'm gonna'...
I'm gonna' give him a snaily treat.
What!? How is that possible? Uhh. Now I want you to paint the Krusty Krab.
Uh. uh. uh. But I want you to do it with this toothbrush.
Oh. no, no, no. Don't worry about Terry. He's in good claws.
Now little sneagle. Ready to do some laundry. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr.
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.
Hee, hee, hee, hee.
Arr, arr, arr. I guess he didn't see that coming.  Hey what's the big ide-er. We've just found a pot at the end of the rainbow. Aieeeee!
It's like taking candy from a baby!
Uh Oh. Pronto. Time for plan B!
Arr, arr, arr, arr.
Arr, arr, arr, arr. How's it going boyo. Are you feeling the coin vibes?
What do you mean you don't feel so good?
You look fine to me. Now stop being such a baby and make me some money. Excuse me pregnant lady coming through!  Uh, he he. Hoo boy. It... it's sure hard being pregger!
Ooh!
Get ready for it now, boy me boy!  Ladies and gentlemen!  Thank you for your money!  Come on Harry! Let's go. Come on you!.
What do you mean? I'm just showing Rory off.
I got nothing of the soul.  I would never steal. You have to quit making up stories, boy-yo
Don't you have work you should be doing?
No, if I was rich I wouldn't have to hire the likes of you!
Why you little yellow... Well, I never...
Who do you think you are!  JACKPOT! Money, money, money, money. Come to papa.  Oh boy.
Arr, arr, arr, arr. Well what do ya know?
What? Oh I can't afford this.
Noooooooooooooooo!
That would be me.
Oh, try telling that guy over there.
Ohh, Okay, Tibor I think I'm good.
Look, SpongeBob, you see all this stuff, including you and me, are brought here when the mermaids sing their beautiful song, the mermaids' song triggers this here contraption, to suck this pile like a vacuum. Dumpin' all the contents here on this island, that is how we ended up surrounded. With all this valuable and resellable stuff!  Oh, Yippee! Another shipment! Free stuff, here I- come?  Pretty neat, aye, boy?
Pearl?  Oh, my sweet little girl, all alone, with me cash register!
Pearl!!
Oh me little angel. Thank you mysterious signing mermaids.
Come on...  Ah ha, playing hard to get, weren't you little one?
SpongeBob? SpongeBob, boy-o! SpongeBob can you hear me?
What's the matter, boy-o?  You're Krabby Patty meter is on empty! We've got to get a Krabby Patty into you quick or-  Please great vacuum cleaner, please just give us just one-  ...Krabby Patty.
Why, thank you, Boy-o. I'm glad you- Wait a minute, I didn't make that Krabby Patty, and you didn't make that Krabby Patty, and those two couldn't have made it, so it must have been that rotten pipsqueak Plankton! I've gotta stop that poor excuse for a life form from- So, how do we get out of here?
Oh really? Well, I think you don't know who to talk to the ladies.
Look, boy, I've got a way with the ladies, and I guarantee the old Krabs charm, will have them telling us exactly how to get out of here.  So there's really no way out of this place? I really need to get back to the Krusty Krab to stop my arch-nemesis from ruining my business.
T.N.O.P?
Don't worry, Pearl, he's okay.
The mall? But Pearl-
Oh do you?
Now, how do you propose we do that, huh? Wait, I know we just hit the magic reverse button on the giant vacuum cleaner.
It sure is, what?
Yeah, backwards, what a stupid idea that-
Speaking of re-claiming... alright Plankton, I know what you're up to but, the jigs up you little conniving pipsqueak! Huh?
So, you've been the one making me Krabby Patties?
Ahhh, the end of another successful business day. You know Squidward this kind of day always reminds me of money  Ahhahhahah....
No way granny!
Well, I've certainly seen enough .
Aye, good job there, SpongeBob. Say, what did you tell here that finally drove her out? I may need to know in case she ever comes back .
Oh, you too SpongeBob. Have a good-  Night...
Too late!
So, it's true!
Found out? Boy, you would have to get up pretty early to sneak a pair of buns past old, Mr. Krabs.
How did you know I wear a sleep mask?
We are not a soup kitchen, boy! And these will be coming out of your paycheck. Besides, we don't want to encourage-  charity...
Come on, boy! Spit it out!
Okay, let's see what's under the hood.  I think that should do it.
Curse? Boy, let me explain something about curses with a short story me grandpappy used to tell me: Oh yes, CURSES ARE NONSENSE!!
Yep. Just fabricated superstition. Right Squidward?
See, boy, just a bonical ramblings of an old lady. Nothing to worry about.
Squidward, I'm starting to get worried. I've got a funny feeling that the Krusty Krab really is cursed.
Well, we haven't seen a single customer all morning!
Yeah, you're right, there is no such thing as curses. Ha.
ME MONEYYY!!!! AAAHHHHHH!!!!
Squidward, wait. You don't even have a contract.
Don't worry, SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs has a special technique when dealing with situations like these. It's called beggin' and pleadin'
Well, SpongeBob. I don't think were ever gonna find-
Well I'll be the slimy, son of a slithery, slippery sea slug, boy. It's here!
Because if ya' don't, me business will be ruined forever.
Oh please, Madame Hagfish. Please, I'll do anything, anything at all.
See, told ya'
Oh, wait a minute, granny, what part of this-
How could you tell?
Hey, SpongeBob so you think this fudgy stuff we're walking in is the eel's-
Hold it, SpongeBob, Look.
Good idea, be careful not to-
He's awake!
I really don't have a choice
Good job ladee!
Madame Hagfish, we've got the gold doubloon you asked for.
Ahh, now it's time to lift that curse, like you promised.
That's it? That's the curse?!
Well, it's like I told you before boy, there ain't no such thing as witches, or curses, or magical beings, or-
THE DRAIN PLUG!?!?!?  SpongeBob!!!  What in Neptune's bathtub do you think you're doing, lad?
Stop messing with that drain plug! Are you daft?
As I was saying... It happened a long time ago... Patrick! ...to a pair of little kids.
Anyway,  it said that the Main Drain beckoned to them, putting them under its spell.
One day, those two kids were wandering through the ocean, when they stumble upon it.
The Main Drain.
Legend has it that their curiosity got the best of 'em.  And they pulled the plug.  The entire ocean rusted in the drain and sucked those two kids right down.  The drain was so powerful, it pulled all of Bikini Bottom into its gaping maw, causing an apocalypse to the sea!  And nobody was ever heard from...again.
Well it right, I...I don't know where it is, and I'm certainly not going to tell you.  So, so, so get out of here and stay away from that drain! No plugs will be pulled on my watch.
Boys, there's more to that story about the Drain! You see...
That's right one day, Plankton and I were wandering around.
You see, we had to lie to keep you from lookin' for it.
Mr. Squidward, how many times do i have to tell you, the customers' jokes are always funny! Now, give the gentlemen a chuckle!
Eh, ya lemons. Afraid of a little lavar? CASHY! Noo! Make it stop raining fire of destruction!
Oh, why even bother, SpongeBob? Can't you see? The civilization as we know is crumbling to dust!  Civilic orders is in tatters. It's every man for himself, there's no other way. I'm gonna need your life essence!
Oh, yes. Of course, ma'am.  Try and behave yourselves, fellas.
What is it, boy?
SpongeBob?  There, there, kid. What's the big deal?
That's nothing to fuss over, boy. We'll just whip up a new batch, like we did in the old days.
I know this process like the back of me claw.  We always start with...  ...flour.  Next, we add  barnacle shavings. It's like riding a boat-cycle, ain't it, boy?
What do ya say we do the next one together, eh?
Sea Salt. SpongeBob:  Turmeric.
What are you on about, boy? Third step's always sea salt.
It's sea salt. And don't you remember SCABS?
Heavens, no. That's disgusting. All right, tell you what, why don't I just go fetch the formula? We'll settle this once and for all.
Aren't you getting a little tired of this, Plankton?
Oh, ho, ho, ho, Of course, I do. That's why I'm doing this.
I need to somehow get Plankton to stop comin' after me precious formula.
SpongeBob, that's it, you genius. You just solved me decades-old dellemer.
Take care of yourself, little formular.
Well, it's simple, Perch.  It seems keeping me secret formula in hand has proven to be all too temptin' for a  certain diminutive one-eyed criminal element of society.
All right, boy, let's get back to making them patties.
Boy, I thought I told you--
Formular, yeah.
On the opposite side of the ocean, yeah.  And now I've gotta go  all  the way  there  to  get it.
Think you're up for the challenge?
Well, all right then,  the formular is now stowed in a safe-deposit box in the ocean's largest, safest bank  in Way-far-out-town-ville.
This, No. This is the key to me heart?  This is the safe-deposit box key.
Not so fast, kid. I want you to protect this at all costs. You mustn't let it out of your sight. I now bestow unto you the key to the future of The Krusty Krab.
Good, let's get you over at the train station.
Good luck, me boy! Don't let me down!
Well, well.
You honestly didn't think I would have left you out of this elaborate equation, did you?
Sure. I believe ya.  Say, since you went through all the trouble of getting here, there you go, Plankton.  Enjoy the scenery. Hey, where'd he go?
Good job, boyo.
Uh... You know, I just remembered, I'm late for a very important meetin'. Take care of it, will ya boy?
No...!
You do realize I'm taking that out of your pay check.
SpongeBob, throw that trash out and get back to work!
Hmm. Future generations, huh?
Welcome to the Krusty Krab Time Capsule Spectacular! That's right! In 50 years, your donated treasures will be honored for future generations to enjoy!  All right, you guys got donations covered, right?
I'm gonna go ahead and take care of souvenirs!
And there's your commemorative time capsule key chain. That'll be $49.57.
All right. You drive a hard bargain. I'll throw in a coupon for one free ice cube in a purchase of any large cola at the Krusty Krab. What do ya say?
And thanks so much for all your contributions! So are ya ready to put this thing in the ground?!
But, before we do, I'd like to make a contribution of my own. A copy of the Krabby Patty formula!
Send her down!
Who's ready to eat some Krabby Patties, 'cause all that waiting in line's got you super hungry?
SpongeBob! Boyo, you've got to help me. Pearl's got her heart set on a new pair of shoes. Your job is to tell her no.
SpongeBob!
Ahoy there, SpongeBob! I need you to work an extra 17 hour shift tonight!
Overtime? O... o... o-ver-time...  Overtime? Hm, let's see here. Over, oversold, overspend, ah! Overtime. More money per hour...  What a filthy, disgusting word!
It's unbelievable. More money for service above and beyond...
What do you want now, Mr. Pottymouth?
Arrrgh! Out, out, and STAY OUT! And don't you come back until you've swabbed that poop deck you call a mouth!
SpongeBob! What are you doing? It's closin' time!  Now get out there and swab the poop deck.
All right boys, time to go ho-
Okay, SpongeBob. Time to hit the road. SpongeBob?
SpongeBob!
What am I running here, a nuthouse?
Pushin' your luck a bit, aren't you, kid?  You were nearly late this morning. You got to be more concientierous or I'll have to start dockin' your pay. Oh, yeah. That's what I'll do.  Doo dee doo, doo dee doo, doo doo doo!  Musical Doodle! SpongeBob! Wake up, boy-o! Don't you need some patties to get started there?
Just focus on makin' them patties, boy-o.
That door squeak sounded decidingly disgruntled.  Me customers!  Why are you running off?
SpongeBob! You gotta cut out that singin', boy! It's repellin' me profits.
Uh-huh. Stop singin' that song! One more outburst out of me and I'll send ye home for the day!
What in blazes are you doing? That's it! You're done for the day!
Let's just rip the little sucker out!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I got one! It's an old sea shanty me and me mates used to sing on the high seas. It be drowsy and wet on the mighty high seas, for I need a boat for rapid disease. Oh, mateys. Oh, mateys. Don't ever weep! If I so ever sleep, cast me into the deep!  He ain't budgin'.
Patty's kr  What the...  TIME FOR THE SHELTER! Doomsday came sooner than I thought.
Oh how do they know my name?
SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob! THAT MAKES ME FURIOUS!
It's not that! It's just that you haven't paid the fee.
Yeah you know. The Krusty Krab Hide and Go Seekers' Fee. For playing hide and seek on Krusty Krab premises.
OK! Good luck finding him!
Closing time already?
Oh, well I'll see you tomorrow.
Sure! Wait, what's tomorrow?
Oh, okay! You may give your snail a Krabby Patty. But please give me a tip, cause pets are sooo special!
What the...?!
What, what?!
Did you check the freezer?!
What about the freezer in the attic?
No attic?!
Oh, yeah.
Well, that settles it, SpongeBob. We're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
You heard me. A fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
What?
You know, SpongeBob, might not be a good idea to bring your dirty snail into me restaurant. I think we just might want to reschedule "Bring Your Pet To Work" day.
Okay, but make sure your pet is healthy, and clean!
Plankton?
Well, he takes after you, lad.  Pay?!
: It's comin' up on that time again. Okay, boy, fire her up.
Don't forget the cheese.
Looks good, kiddo. You want to do the honors?
Oh, I mean.
What are you going on about? I let you turn the sign every day. (cut to SpongeBob walking up to the closed sign and puts a briefcase down. Opens it up to put on his 'ceremonial gloves' to turn the sign)
(storms to SpongeBob) All right, you landlubbers, get the lead-- (gasps) Neptune's jewels! Where are all me costumers? And just when the Krabby Patty was about to go triple platinum. Squidward. Squidward? Squidward!
In case you two haven't noticed, we got no customers! And we're not gonna get 'em back if you two lazy susans sit around the TV all day.
(jumps on Squidward, squishing him) Who dares lay claim to the title best restaurant in the sea?
Blimey, this is the first I've heard of this Mr. Sea Chicken. There goes me monopoly. But how did he lure away me loyal customers away so fast? SpongeBob, I need you to head over to the Sea Chicken Shack and see what's cookin'.
Uh, that won't be necessary, boy. Just look around, see how he's roping in all these customers.
SpongeBob, I don't need a spy.
Right.
Boy, stop this nonsense!
Just tell me what you see, SpongeBob.
What about the food?
Cut the spy lingo and just tell me, is there anything remarkable about the Sea Chicken Shack?
What you're describin' is an absolute dump. Are there any unique or interesting amenities that might attract me customers in any way?
What is it, lad? What do you see?
A statue? How does a statue steal me customers? (static on other end of radio) SpongeBob? SpongeBob? (he's taken his wristband radio off and is now climbing on the giant chicken statue) Of course, Mr. Sea Chicken, you mad trickster, you, cater to the kids and the parents will foll-er. (cut to later at Krusty Krab) Boys, we don't have much time, so I'm gonna make this short and sweet. I need an artist, someone with a vision...
Someone among us with a big talent...
Someone to create a glorious, towering statue of my likeness. You guys know anyone around here with an artistic bone in their body?
Ooh, really? Who?
Um, Larry The Lobster?
Old Man Jenkins?
1-tooth Sally?
My mom?
Then who?
Oh, that's right, Squidward. You do dabble in the doodlin' doodly-doo.
Hey, hey, now hold on, Mr. Squidward. You and I aren't that different from each other. We both "make product."
Yes. Squidward, do you have any idea how many people come to the Krusty Krab every day?
Well, that's 12 more seeing your art than yesterday.
You got it, long as it's done by opening tomorrow.
As advertised.
If you want the public to experience your cultural input, get it ready by 8:00am.
Here you go. (SpongeBob is Squidward's assistant)
I'm gonna be rich.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? I'm...shy.
Like this?
Or this? (poses with a bow and arrow)
Or this? (poses with a golden discus)
Or this? (poses as the thinker)
Oh, come on, Squidward. (sniffs his armpits)
How long am I gonna have to stay like this?
Come on, Squidward, I'm about to give out!
Okay, let's see it!
Yeah, yeah, just show me. (Squidward pulls back the curtain)
What's that supposed to be?
I don't have a mouth in my stomach.
Whatever that means. But is it safe for kids to play on?
Well, we should do a dry run before we let the general public use it. SpongeBob!
I'm gonna need you to frolic and play on this here doohickey thingy.
Squidward! I can't let kids play on thatthatthat weapon. I'm gonna get my pants sued off.
Oh it's a piece all right, a piece of junk!
Did you hear something? (cut to Mr. Krabs being painted golden and having kids climb on him) Oh, how long do I have to stay like this?
Ravenous?  That means hungry!  Krabby Patties! Get your Krabby Patties! Only 3.99 each!  That'll be 54.95.  Don't care for Krabby Patties, huh? Well, maybe there's something else on the menu you'd like!
Welcome to The Krusty Krab!   You seem to be a mollusk of deserting taste. Could I introduce you to a side of Kelp Fries?  Hey! I'm not on the menu!
You did it, boy!
I'm not impressed...
Now I'm impressed!
Go on.
Why? Would you like to buy one?
Would you pay the same as what a Krabby Patty costs?
What 'bout double?
Up here boys! Take a look!
It says "Krusty Dogs, only $3.99! Or $4.99 with cheese!
Avec fromage, Monsieur Squidward! Avec fromage!
SpongeBob! Three more Krusty Dogs! Pronto!
SpongeBob! Three more orders of Krusty Dogs! Extra Krusty!
Yep!
Oh, forget about making those Patties! Just make the wieners!
I'm just going to make a few changes to the Krusty Krab menu. That's all!
Oh, that reminds me! Do you have an eraser I could borrow?
Ah, never mind. I'll just cross it off.  No more Krabby Patties!
Pardon me.
SpongeBob. SpongeBob. Wake up.
You're back in yer old kitchen. And the paramedics were here to revive ye.
Maybe. But now we have this!
I got'cha a new one!
Alright! Those wieners aren't going to rotisserie themselves. Everybody back to work.
Ahoy SpongeBob! How's go the wieners?
What on earth for?! Krusty Dogs was your best idea ever boy!
Yea, good point.
SpongeBob! What happened in here? Where all me customers?! What are we gonna do?
Hey SpongeBob! Have you seen Mr. Squidward?
Perfect! And keep them Krabby Patties coming, boy!
What's all the racket?!
Patrick, if you're going to distract me fry cook, the least you can do is buy some grub!
Back to work, boy.
That's odd.
Mauna Loa?! As in the shipwreck Mauna Loa? Legend has it that the largest unfound pirate booty lies in a truance. I have been searching for this treasure during me entire adult life. Lookin' over every nook, every cranny, every denture. Once I get me claws on it, I'll be the richest crustacean in the world!
Hmm, looks like him and Patrick are trying to haul the loot for themselves. Come on, Squidward. We got to let those two dingalees lead us straight to the Mauna Loa!
Found it!
No. I just saw the sign.
So you thought you could hide the treasure from old Mr. Krabs, did ya?
Yeah, yeah, nobody's treasure. You're such a nice boss. You expect me to believe this malarkey?!  You're a stonewall, eh? We'll see about that!  Where'd you two blunders find the gold coin?
Heh, jokers.
I knew I'd find it! Check it out, fellas, cool, hard doubloons!
Eh? What's this? "Token Has No Monetary Value?" Tokens?! This must be a decoy.
Whee-hee! What the barnacle? Well, it's just full of tickets!
Ticket booth?!
"Must Be This Tall To Ride?"
Out of me way, boy.  I knew it. The lost treasure of the Mauna Loa is finally mine! I can practically taste them jewels.  It's a little lighter than I thought. Huh? It's empty.  No good. Ha, ha, very clever, captain. Throw in Krabs, the old ringer, eh? You must have a treasure map or something. Where you keeping it? In your pocket?  Plastic? Hang on a minute. A plastic captain... a ticket booth... tokens? It's not the Wreck of the Mauna Loa, It's "The Wreck of the Mauna Loa" amusement park ride!
Well, I'm not!
This place ain't got no treasure! Keep your worthless hunk of junk!
Oh-ho-ho, don't flatten yourself. People want to see the real thing! It's not like a million people just show up to an old amusement park ride for fun.  Wait a minute. That's exactly what they do. Oh-ho-ho, brace yourself, fellas. Your hideaway's about to become the worst kept secret in the sea!
Step right up, don't be shy! Experience the amusement and terror of The Wreck of the Mauna Loa!
That's right, folks! We spare no expect to restore this plastic ship to its former glory!
Oh-ho-ho, I disagree. I'd say the little  fella is just right.
Okay, people, let's not do anything we might regret!
Whatwhatwhat are you talking about? You can't take me to the pokey! I
Oh, Squidward. I was going through some records back in me office and. Huh? So, you got the hairpiece after all.
What was that?
Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?
Kara-tay? You should be making me money-ay! With your spatu-lae! Now get back to work.
No more.
Shh! No more of this karate stuff, lad. Or you're fired.
What the?  SpongeBob!
What did I just get through telling ye, lad?
SpongeBob, you're fired!
Eh?
Hmmm. Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind.  Mmm, mammals.
Huh? What the barnacle?
Fire you?  I've got something else in mind.
I love money-ay!
Now, how much is that- Mr. Krabs gets cut off by Plankton going through his eyes.  Eugh!
Eugh! I see. So it was you that befouled me office earlier?
Did you hear something?
Hmmm. Sounds like a mutiny.  What the...?!  What in Neptune's knickers is this?!
Ooooh! You mean Mr. Squidward.  Well, he's at his post right over the...  Where's me cashier?!  SPONGEBOB! Where in Poseidon's pantyhoes is that sorry excuse for a cashier?
Yes. I mean Squidward. WHERE IS HE?!
Oooooh. He requires , does he?  What's all the ruckus?!  Oh no! Please, no! This is terrible!  Are you hurt?
I wasn't talking to you!  Don't worry, papa's here.
I didn't even know you had ankles.
Injured? On the job?! Oh no! That would mean...
Substantial fines?!  You know, Squidward... uh... I can't really let the OWS hear about this, you know.
Well now, Squidward!  Let's not be hasty!  I'll take care of your poor little ankle personally.  SpongeBob! Squidward needs first aid
Please don't report me to the OWS. I'll do anything. Anything for you.
Now if you need anything, just let me know.
Ok.
What did you say?
fluff your pillow, I'll fluff your pillow.
Oh nothing.
Well, at least there's not that much customers anyway.  Of course.
It's what criminals wear when they go to bed.  I'm I think Mr. Squidward is hiding something from us, and I want you to figure out what it is.
Shhhh.  You gotta keep it a secret from Squidward.
I ain't touching your tentacles with a 10-ft pole...
I'll be right back. How's the solution coming?
Coming!
Oh, for the love of peat moss.
How long do I need to keep this up?
Squidward, after all I've done for you, you've called the OWS.
No!! Oh, Why, why, why?!  Hold on a sec. That's my security surveillance camera.
I yeah I forgot. I borrowed that from the airport. Now, let's see what really happened here.  You faker! Not to mention that you were sleeping on the job!
I'm gonna make you pay.
That's nice.
Oh, goodness no. You go ahead. Take it.
Nonsense.  Run along little fella. Enjoy your Krabby Patty.
Oh, just a little security measure I've been working on. Now all Krabby Patties self-destruct 10 feet beyond the Krusty Krab! Sucker!
Oh, poor wittle baby waby. Does wittle Pwanksy wanksy need his nappy wappy?
Yeeh, those day are over, SpongeBob.
And that's the way we like it.
The bank is handing out free samples of money?
What!? Some imitation patty is tryin' to steal me business? Oh, but me customers are loyal.  They won't leave for some nasty Flabby Patty.  The Flabby Patty shack has stolen all me customers!
Oh, no they won't, because I'll steal the Flabby Patty recipe first!
Ha! I bet I get that recipe way before you.
Bet I will!
Will!
Same to you!
Dig, SpongeBob, dig.
Ha! Recipe theivin' is as easy as pie.
Where are you hiding.  Ooo, there you are my sweetie.
Grandma.
That'll show hi--
I'll never work with that melignorant microbe.
I've heard all I'm gonna hear from the likes of you.
Okay, so here's the plan. I want you to--  I'm sorry, do you mind?  Let's go some place more private.  Once I stand in line I want you to--  Waitin' in line here. That's all.
Ooo, and announcement. We should listen. It might save your lives.
Brilliant work laddie.  Hey, how come you're not trampled.
Looks like you blew it again, Plankton.
Says who?
Okay, fine.  We'll work together.
We look ridiculous. Nobody's gonna buy this disguise.
Okay, what's your stupid plan anyway?
Little more. Little more.
Stop whining!
Hello, I'm here to stealnodarn...I mean, apply for a job.
Yes! The recipe is mine!
No you don't, Plankton!  Ah! Give it here!
The recipeWe did it.
Now, let's see what's the flabby that's in this patty.
Wait a minute, this isn't a recipe for patties. It's a recipe for friendship.
What? You mean all this was one of your goofball schemes?
Yeah, and how to comically bludgeon meself.
Great idea, pal.  We'll teach you about teamwork. () Get back here!
Oh ahoy, SpongeBob! I'm was just using some old toothpaste I found to patch up this small hole in the wall.
And why is that, Mr. Squidward?
It-it-it's just a hole in the wall, boy. It doesn't have a flavor.
Oh. Well I think it's...
We did?
Boy, I don't know how I think think of this stuff, but I think I got a winner! We are putting in a drive through!
You mean for you.
Oh nonsense, we'll build it for free!
Ahoy, SpongeBob. What's with all the booty?
OK, but, I got something better. A menu made with napkins and tape, A microphone system made of tin cans, and this sign... I made it from an old noodle.
I'm sorry, what?
Because it was...  Free!
Yes, you like it here, don't you?  Can I help you?  What?! A bill?! What's this for?
There we go, problem solved.
Ahoy, Squidward.
Problem solved!
Mr. Squidward! Any customers?
Oh? Here comes one now!
A bill?! And what is this for?
You have any idea what a real microphone and speaker costs?!
Well...they cost as much as...as uh...as a...real microphone and...speaker.
Hey! You delinquent!
Replace what?
What do I look like I'm made out of tin cans?
Good thing we have you around to always point out the obvious!
Well that's nice! I'm still billing you for the damages!
Oh? Why SpongeBob?
Yeah...Well there's a solution to every problem!  There! Problem solved  Hey! What is all the ruckourous about!? Woah...
Squidward! There's a line of customers out there a million miles long!
I guess I'll be retiring early after all! .
Yeeesss?  What? Is this a-a-a ticket?!
Ah! But officer! I a...I a...Listen!
Oh sure! Right! Phew! Hah hah hah...SpongeBob can you get the kind officer two-
Here you go officer! And thanks for being so understanding! If you know what I mean? No charge.
Mr. Mayor!
Well...don't you worry Mr. Mayor! I have a answer for that too!  There you go! See now we have two drive thrus, two lines, and I'll make money twice as fast! .
Gasp! They're everywhere!
Stay back! Take Squidward, not me!  Oh, hi Squidward.
Easy boys! Easy! Don't you think you both are getting a little carried away? I mean, I hardly call this a riot! Right, hah hah. Like-  Oh....kay...Don't worry! I can solve this!  More drive thrus! More money!
Hey? Somebody eating potato chips?
Ha! When fetching money is involved, nobody topples me!
Come on, boys! Get me to the green mats!
Nooo! I can't let him win!
Sniff out the money, little guys! Come on! Marsh!  Wai-wait a minute. I was gonna feed ya! Honest!
Heeelp!
I just been turned into lunchmeat by me own worms!
Much appreciate it, boy!
Great. Now we're trapped.
Good thinkin', squirrel! This should keep us alive for at least... a few hours... oh...
Hey Squidward, what is it with the extra foot, buddy?
Not you again!
That's weren't the attack.
This is it!
That, me boy, is none other than the Abominable Snow Mollusk.
Nope, that didn't work.  [???]
Weren't bravery that got us out. Let's just say... We had to wait... for nature, to take its course.
Argargarg! I'd sooner swallow a jellyfish the winning with y--
The race! The million clams!  I've been trapped in ice, mutinous thieves trying to cheat me out of me winnings.
Duped? You don't mean by...
My formula! We've got to get back to Bikini Bottom!
We're doomed. Oh hoho!
No offense, but we're not going to catch Plankton moving at a snail's pace.
Lookin' clear so far.
Okay... then where's my restaurant?
And where's my formula?
The Chum Bucket, now serving... Krabby Patties?!
We'll see about that boy-o!
This will only take a minute.
Not if I have anything to say and or do about it!
I guess I didn't want to miss the grand unveiling of my sandwich.
Then hand over my formula.
You get back here, Plankton!
Give up now and I'll let you keep one of your antenna!
Huh?
We're trapped!
He's going to turn us into fried snacks!
Don't eat me, eat Squidward!
He'll have to wait for nature to take its' course.
Yeah, well your coda is affecting me quota. The shrill piercing racket of your fish flute is frightening away me money.
Well, I don't know. That's what they used to call it back in the
There, there, laddie. Just let the legal system run its course.
Get back to work, Mr. Squidward!
Huh?  Ooh, money! Money, money, money, money, money, money, money!  What the?  SpongeBob!  Patrick!  What's the meaning of this?
What?! It was your idea, huh?
Great, SpongeBob! That'll be fifty bucks!
And here's your patty! One more art patty, Mr. Star!
Please be money, please be money.  Oh! That's not money. It's from SpongeBob.  "Dear Mr... Krabs, please come to my house tonight. I am having a free money party." Free money party!? This sounds too good to be true!
Eh... SpongeBob?
Can we skip the magic and get right to the free money?
Heh, it's supposed to be three wishes.
That-a-boy! Ar ar ar ar!  It's free tickets!
Wohoo! Works for me!  Gentlemen, I'm leaving you in-charge! See you when I see ya!
Well, I suppose I could make that extra ticket available to, say, who ever is to be me man-servant?
Now look here, boy. I'm bringing along the secret formuler as a precaution, just in case our absence proves to temptin' to a certain one-eyed creepy-crawly.
Whee, ah ha ha!
Ah, ha ha ha! Now push me back to the top, push me to the top!
Ah ha ha! Whee! Ha ha ha! Ar ar ar ar!
Did you hear that?  I could've sworn that I heard Plankteron!
Oh, well. One more time around the deck!
Wahoo!
I'm feeling lucky!
Oh yeah!
Ar ar ar ar!
Oo, what's all this? Free Land Food, sounds so exotic.  Huh, this looks promising.  That tastes like putrefied coral stems dipped in rotten butter sauce.
Uh, I don't know how anyone can stand this slop. It makes me miss our grub over back at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob, be a good man-servant and fix me up a Krabby Patty, would ya?
He he hey! Looks like we have a business venture on our hands. This vacation just got a whole lot more lookerin' if you know what I'm sayin'. Krabby Patties! Come and get your Krabby Patties!
Hm, watch me sucker this guy. That will be a mere one hundred dollars.
Come to daddy!  Hey, wait a minute, there's chum all over this bill. Hey, buddy! Where did you get this?
Nooooo!
Me costumers! Aw, this vacation is a total bust!
Who's ready for some excitement?
Who is ready for some fun?
Who's ready to look at some vacation pictures?
I'm sure you know this charming fellow!  Here's the one that almost got away!  Look at these pile towers of golden green!  Here's how the whole thing started!
That's right. You better have a seat laddy. Gentlemen! I have an announcement to make. As of tomorrow, I'm closing the Krusty Krab.
Relax boy! I'm just going on vacation for a few days.  Yesiree laddy! I think the old Krusty Krab can afford a few days in dried up while I take little Pearl to a long, overdue vacation. And I was kinda hoping, that you come along with us, SpongeBob.  Come along with us, SpongeBob. Come along with us...  Now, tell me about
For a nominal fee of course. So, what do think boy?
SpongeBob?  SpongeBob!?
Great! We'll have some fun!
Pearl my dear! Are you all packed and ready to go?
ME BOTTOM DOLLAR? Why I never do that!
Eh... It still is! SpongeBob's... like a son to me! Plus he'll pay a top dollar to tag along.
See? You two are already having fun together!
Did you hear something?
Oh, cheer up pumpkin puss! We're almost there!
Noooo! No. The place we are going is much better!
But we are making such great time! Try to hold it a little longer lad!
The place we are going is 100 times better than that old amusement park!
Bathroom Land! Oh SpongeBob! You kill me!
Ok, kids! We're just about there! Just over that hill, is the greatest sight in the sea! Now close your eyes for a big surprise!
Ok! We're here! You can open your eyes now!
It's the Bikini Bottom Mint! Where they make all of the money! Have you ever seen anything so beautiful in all of your life?
Well laddy! Looks like it's just you and me! And of course, the Mint!
Is this the most exciting day in you life?
You hear that boy?  The entire money making... process!
Guah guah guah guah guah!
Just paper? That's like saying the ocean is just water! Or, or the Krabby Patty's just a... a... a sandwich!
Oh!  Uh... uh...
Wuh wuh wuh... o-o-one million shiny pieces of...  silver coins?
Thanks SpongeBob!
He he he he!
Hello! My name is Eugene! What's yours?  Do you believe in love at first sight?
I'd say! I almost had that quarter's phone number!
Pretty neat huh boy? That's where they...  ...DESTROY MONEY? NOOO!  NOOO! WHY? WHY?
It's a miracle!
Oh no you don't! You filthy dollar wrestler!
Grrrr... YAHHH!
Good work boy!
Mine! I haven't charged you yet for tagging along on me vacation!
SpongeBob, what's holding up those patties?
SpongeBob, what's wrong with you? You're paler than a baby sea horse.
The suds?
Alright, SpongeBob, you're too sick to work.
No, now go home and get some rest.  Nothing personal, lad. I just can't have you sneezing all over my food!
No, wait! Wait!
Shiny dimes.
SpongeBob?  Stop! SpongeBob! Stop!  Ooh.
What in Neptune's name is going on?  Come back!  SpongeBob, what in the blue barnacles, are you up to?!
You had a what?
Did you say doubloon?  Let me see that! Hmm, looks somewhat authentic  Smells real enough!
Okay, let's go see those ghosts, fellers! We'll catch 'em and take their gold!
Great, then it's settled, let's go catch us some ghost gold!
Come on, Squidward! Think about what those treasures can do for the Krusty Krab, eh? Huh? Why, I can buy you that break room you've always wanted!
Super! Let's go catch us some treasure! So what do you say, SpongeBob! Are ya ready!
Who needs a soul when you're filthy rich?
Ha-ha-ha
Oh, don't be silly, SpongeBob! There's no such things as germs.  Heads up, Squidward!  Hey, Patrick, think fast!
All righty, then. Let's get while the getting's good! Ooh!  Looks like I missed one! Uh... it seems to be stuck... uuuuuuhhhh...
Pfttttt! You ghosts don't scare me! You're nothing but thin air! Grab your sacks and follow me, boys!  Noooooooooooooooooooo!
Hmm. So this is limbo. Well, at least I have a sack full of doubloons to spend eternity with. Uh-oh. Gotta use the can!  Ooh. There's a bit of luck. A portable potty. What's this here? "Insert doubloon?" Nooooooooooooo!
Thanks, lassie. Now, let's just get this here bag of doubloons back to the Krusty Krab!
Hey, you thieving bilge rat! I stole this gold fair and square!
Me gold!
How's the holdup, Mr. Squidward?
Well, money's money!
Hmm. Those must be worth something down here.
Good job Laddy, another fullful day pushing patties.
You know, turning patties into lettuce.
Cabbage, Green Backs, MONEY!!
Obsession is kind of a strong word.  Sleep tight, my little angels.
What's going on in here? Hmm, Everything seems to be in order.The safeis still safe. Huh, I must be hearing things.Hey, how did the pickle end up on the floor?  Now, what was that rule about dropped food? Was it 5 seconds or 5 minutes or... ah, well. waste not, waste not.
And that's why your promotion means a 50% cut in salary, understand, SpongeBob?
Me Krabby Patty Formula!
Hey! Something smells and it isn't my long johns.  Let's see here, you had the formula, why didn't you run off with it?
Since when do you care about stealing?
You know, I don't think I trust this nice, polite, pleasant Plankton.
Uh huh.
SpongeBob?
Didn't you already mop this area?
Well, then, why would you mop it again?
Good point.
Pearl, what brings you in on such a fine afternoon?
Oooh, that is terrible.  Makes my shell crawl just thinking about it. Bleugh!
Why ever not?
Oh-ho-ho-ho. Now, calm down there, my little Pearl. I'm sure it can't be half as awful as you...  Great rusty hinges of Davy Jones' Locker!
Anything for me beloved angel!
I meant whatever you need to get rid of your blemish, not liquidate me retirement fund.
Oh, SpongeBob.  How would you like to...  Ease it!   How would you like to do your dear old chum a favor and raid this beautiful daughter of her evil barnacle?
Pearl, I'm home!
For a second there, I thought a towering, hideous, mind-boggling abomination was standing here, staring at me in my own living room! But then I realized...  it's only my old, beloved daughter, Pearl.  Oh, Pearl. No, no, no need for these expensive trips to the spa. But don't worry, SpongeBob here will take care of it. I have more important measures to take care of.  Me jewwweells!
Don't just stand there, boy! Come help me with this!  There we go. Sometimes it just gets a little stuck.
Why, it's my old soap press!
That's right! All the soap Pearl and I use comes from this machine. And the best part is, it runs on 100% pure leftover Krabby Patties!
Their precious essences are harvested, and after a brief cooling process, tumble out this conveyor belt as fresh, wonderful bars of soap!  Fresh and invigorating! Plus, it's absolutely free.
Krabby Patty .
Well, if you want to split hairs, I suppose--
Got to go, keep your cellphone!
My jewels! SpongeBob, my entire collection of precious jewels is gone! Seen it?
Help! Police! Thief!  Stop that whale!
Hey! What's going on out here?
Well, okay. I suppose I can't have her croaking at the Krusty Krab. That'd be bad for business. All right, let's see here. Hmm... Oxygen. "02," I believe. Good old atomic number eight.
But how are you gonna get them down?
Wait a minute. Those straws cost me money!
So you think I'm full of hot air, do ye? Well, in this case, you're right. There's usually an air bubble or two trapped inside me shell.  Go ahead. Don't be shy.
What better way to spend an afternoon than trolling the sea vent for spare change.  Whooh!  There's got to be a small fortune than discarded paperclips in there!  I knew this place looked familiar. [ What's this? Goodness, that must be Sandy's Treedome dwelling, and inside looks to be the largest soybean I have ever layed me eyestocks on. Now this bears getting a closer look.  Good afternoon, Miss Sandy.
Well uh, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and was wondering if you could see you in clear and grace me with a comprehensive tour of your homesweet treedome.  I hear the giant soybean is lovely this time of the year.
Don't bother yourself. As long as I keep me ole lungs moist, I can breath your fancy air all day long.
Seems so much bigger once your inside.
Huh? Oh yeah, that sounds interesting Sandy, but uh actually...
Uh Sandy, actually I'm not interested in all of that.
Tell me about your giant soybean.
Or a supply of entire rest---.
Morning, Laddy. Say, what's with the glass puppet?
Eh, Bubble Buddy, huh? That guy still owes me money! So, what's the little deadbeat's name?
Put it there!  Hey!
Come here you little rascal!
Well, would you look at that. I never felt this clean on a weekday. Why don't you take into the kitchen and let him play with the dirty dishes?
You better get him out of here if you wanna keep him that way!  Bubbles today. They don't seem to understand the value of money.
Me soda machine!!!
You really sent him over the edge this time.
Let me see that!  Thank you! Look boy, I don't know what in coral cabins what a restraining order is, but I do know whatever's going on here clearly ain't working. Now I want this ship sailing smoothly! On the double! Or I'll be forced to remove more gold stars from your employee performance chart!
Patrick! I am not NOT paying you to stand around and play guess what the idiot's thinking with Squidward! Get back to work!
Why all the shivering of the timbers Mr. Squidward?
It'll stand. Oh, unless you want to talk with SpongeBob
Mr. Squidward...
Time for your break
Nice work, Patrick! Break time's over, Mr. Squidward.
At the Krusty Krab, where the tastiest sandwich in the seas is grilled to perfection by our expert fry cook.  And served with a smile by our friendly waiter.
Wait a minute. Why am I dressed in a leotard?
Nah, I don't think so!  We need a gimmic that's nothing short of a masterpiece.
Yeah, yeah enough dilly-dallying. Now, help me with the garbage Mr. Squidward.
Ok, let's not overdo it.
Heh, you call this art? Looks like a swappy's footlocker.
Hold it!   I'll take a million for it.
Me plate, me buns, me mustard,  me Fiasco.
Great idea, Farkle. Gotta protect me valuable property.
Oh, so now you're a restaurant critic.  Step up! Step up for your free glimpse at the Fiasco masterpiece!  Alright, you've had your look. Now hold up your end of the bargain!
Each!
I know that scream anywhere! It's me profits dying!  Stop that thief!
STOP THIEF!!!
Of course, Officer. Heh, can't let me fry cook rot in this place. It'll ruin me business! Especially, now that the Fiasco's finato!
Thanks very much. Enjoy the show. You sure saved the day boy-yo.
What happened?
Thanks for rescuing us SpongeBob. But what are we going to do with all of this green slop?
Relish Patties! Get your Freaky Clone Jelly Relish Patties! Only 4 bucks extra!
Over here boy.
The whole town has turned against me! And I have no idea why.  "Because the Krabby Patty is terrible".  Krabby Patty? Terrible? How do those words even go together?
SpongeBob, you're right. We have to do everything in our power to bring those customers back. We'll triple the prices.
Fine.  How about that?  I'M RUINED!
I'm all ears.
Don't you say it, boy.
Time? But it's too soon.  I'm not ready to let them go free.
I don't remember saying anything like that.
NO!
Uh, for a second. I thought we have to give away a ton of Krabby Patties, but it looks like free ain't even enough to jump start me business. Wait, free ain't even enough, my business is doomed!
Not this time boy, it's all over for the good old Krusty Krab, it's probably best if you start looking forward for a new job, boy, maybe in the different way like.
Well, that was better than I expected. Well only one more thing left to do now. I have to leave back with me mom.
Do you mind, I'm trying to make a money angel here.
Sure thing, SpongeBob. Hop in!  Did you hear what?
Good point.
SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You were supposed to be at work two hours ago!
Your absence is costing me money!
And, Squidward! I expect more from you. Well, actually, no... I don't.
Well... I suppose I could join the cause. But, it'll have to be our standard deal.
You got it kiddo!
Not a bad bit of wooden starry if I do say so meself. Time to put the finishing touches on her.  Hm.
Not exactly, Miss Cheeks. A pineapple needs to be mobile, with a strong hull attached in case you need to skip town unexpectedly.
Heads up!  Careful, boy. I thought I'd install a grill in your TV room for those nights where you have to bring work home with you.
Ho ho, kiddo. Look out. Just applying some plaster stucco exterior here.
Yes?
And, since you're such a satisfied customer, I only charged you double.
Good work, boy!
Ah, the end of another lucrative work day SpongeBob.
Seriously son you gotta lighten up. Well good night kiddo.
Yes, sir, sure as the sea's wet.
Phew, would be the first I've been saved by a pile of trash.
Free! Now what kind of barnacle would throw out a perfectly good computer?
Huh. He always has been a knucklehead.
Perhaps. But who could pass up a free computer?  Let's plug her in, see what she can do.
She's loading up. Now let's see how this dial up thingy works.  This thing does text mails right?
Oh, that sounds promising.
Our computer's suppose to emote? No need to cry, little lady.
She's malfunctioning
You're right, must be interfering with her circuitry
Help me out here, buddy.
Wait! Where ya goin? Smooth, SpongeBob, real smooth.  Let's talk this out.
SpongeBob, what part of "free computer" are you not understanding?
Well in the case, welcome aboard!
Yeehaw!
I see Squidward must not have gotten the last company text mail. Karen will be taking over your duties from now on Mr. Squidward. She's efficient and more importantly: I don't have to pay her.
Not so fast Mr. Squidward.
Seriously? Did you just say money?
Welcome to the fight of the century! Where for only $5.99, and the purchase of two Krabby Patties, you will plead the answer to the age-old question. Which is superior? High-speed integrated circuits?
...Or old-school vacuum tubes and diodes?
Oh great. There goes me revenue. What am I gonna do now?
Keep it up, Mr Squidward. The kids love robots.
What's that?
I don't think so.  You used too much mustard!
You obviously you didn't use your hydronic mustard gage.  You think mustard grows from seeds!  Oh, at this rate, I'll be broke in  411 years!
Your skills are rusty, you're not use your sharp self! Did you have breakfast this morning?
Hmm... what would about sleep, young man. Did you get enough sleep?
That's it!  You're insomniac!
You're a person who can't sleep and you can't get enough sleep! Your mind starts to go!  Here.  Come on! Now, cook!  I knew it! You lift it a patty from one side, instead of straight up! What are you trying to do, sabotage me?!  Now, you go home and get some rest!
Miss work? If you keep making mistakes like that, boyo, there will be no Krusty Krab!
That's right!  Now, get!
Come back tomorrow, after a good night's sleep!
Boyo?
SpongeBob!
Ew! You're stinking like Davy Jones' locker! Are you sure you didn't forget something boy?
What are you doing? That's not the sink!
You didn't hear my words, did ya? You couldn't be bothered to get some shut eye, could ya?
Now he's crying away me mustard. THAT'S ENOUGH BOY! Me profits!  Huh? Your crying the perfect amount! Hold it boyo, You're a natural mustard dispenser!
Dow, uh, nuh, no, no boy. It's terrible.
Just terrible.
Ooh. I know this sound. It's the sound of me money being flushed down the toilet!  SpongeBob! Why aren't you manning the fryer?
What? Are you out of your liquid-absorbing mind?
Haven't ye ever heard the saying "If you don't stop making that face, it'll freeze that way"?
Let me tell you the story of Face Freeze.  It were a cold day, in November, and in Bikini Bottom lived a man who loved to make faces. And the one he liked best was to stick his tongue out.  But what he really liked, was to stick his tongue at people.
Until one day, when he stuck his tongue out for the 444th time,  his face froze with his tongue sticking out...
Permanently!
He couldn't open his mouth for months. Until one day, his tongue dried up and fell off!
So are you fonna keep making faces, boys?
Good. I hope you've learned your lesson.
[At Krusty Krab]Ahoy, SpongeBob!
Hey, you all right boy, eh, look a little killy-wompish walking in here.
: Ahem. But what's with this cubed posture
: (Gasps) Where?! Where?!
: Penny, penny, penny, penny.
: Wait, come back!
: What's going on back here? Why are we losing business?
Face me when I'm talking to you boy.  So I can see your face.
SpongeBob, you better stand up this instant or... Huh?
: Oh, I see what's going on here.  Aha! You just had to keep making faces, didn't ya? You couldn't heed me warning, could ya?
I'm losing business, because you thought I was telling one of me stories?! Why, this makes me so angry! I could just... just... just... ahhh! NO, I can't move my face. I've got a Face Freeze too!!
: LOOK! Squidward has it too!
You're sick?!
Well, you don't look any sicker than you usually do. You know what. I'm better give you the old navy whatsoever just to be sure.
Now open wide.
Tongue looks fine.  Eyes, check.
Forehead feels normal.  Now let's see those kneecaps.  Reflexes are a little slow. But I'd expect that from you.
Well, Mr. Squidward, in my expert opinion, you look fit as a fiddle.
Mr. Krabs nothing.
Mr. Krabs nothing!
Mr. Krabs nothing! Just go ahead. I'm gonna keep sayin' it.
No. And I don't want them to get hungry either.  Now step to it, Mr. Squidward. Oh yeah, and get well soon.
Neptune's Knee-highs, lad! How many times do I have to remind you to knock?!
That's better. Now what can I do you for?
That's funny. You're the second person today whose told me that.
Squidward. But I checked out that slimy green cashier personally, and if he's sick, then I'm the next mayor of Marbleway Mountain. That doesn't sound like a bad gig actually.
Mr. Squidward, got a minute?
We've got a situation with the kid. Something's got him spooked.
He can't cook in this condition. No cooking, no patties. No patties, no money.
I need you to make yourself scarce for a while.
Well, I don't care where you go, just as long as you get outta here!
SpongeBob, everything all right in here?
Well how about a little less pleasure and a little more work.
SpongeBob! You sure everything's alright?
Well, I can't just stand by while me restaurant becomes a breeding ground for infection. SpongeBob, go home. That's an order!
Who's gonna run it? I could run this place blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back. I'll show ya.
25 Krabby Patties!  Order up! Order up!
I told you. I could run this place all by myself. Blindfolded with one claw tied behind me back.
Well, SpongeBob, funny you should ask. Because in me expert medical opinion, I think I may be coming down with a nasty case of Squid's Disease.
Romantic Comedy, The Movie? No!  Ah! Get that thing away from me!
Atten--  Attention, Krusty Krab  patrons. Behold!
Today only, the Krusty Krab presents our first annual bun seed guessing contest.  Guess how many seeds are in the jar and win a f-- f-- sorry, a f-- f-- I'll try again. A f-- f--  free Krabby Patty!
Step right up.  Guess right and win.  They'll never guess it.
No. Next, please.
Nope.
N-n-no.
No.
That's not even a number.
Plankton, you  don't get to guess.
Oh, I'm sorry, but it's me restaurant and I can do what I please. Besides, I know you'll try to analyze that patty and find out me secret formula.
Yeah, right. Like they would even take your call.
That Plankton cracks me up. Like the Bogus Business Bureau would care about my dumb contest.
Eh, uh, no. He's out of town.
New trainee.
I'm won't do it.  And you can't make me.
Oh, fine.
No worries. That nitwit Plankton hasn't got a chance.
Oh, he's getting close.
Wrong! It's five hundred thousand three hundred and none. You are one over the mark. You lose.
500298, 500299, 500300.  I win.
I can't.
SpongeBob needs to clean the grill first.
Doesn't your spatula need aligning or something?
Drat your efficiency. Uh, oh, yeah.  I can't serve you your Patty until after the show.
The show that comes with a free Krabby Patty.  See?
No, this is isn't part of the show.
Once upon a time, there was a happy Patty Laddie.
He was beloved by all the good-hearted people in the world. Alas, there is also a villain in this story, by the name of  Pl-- Flankton.
So, one day, when the lad was minding his own business, Flankton struck and took a huge bite out of the Laddie's face.
Unfortunately for Flankton,  the Patty didn't sit well with him. And he was so evil, it caused him to bloat something fierce...  ...until eventually he popped.  The end.
Alright, SpongeBob, we can't stall him any longer. Make it a good one, laddie. This may be the last Patty you'll ever cook.
Psst. I got a plan. You keep that blasted bureaucrat busy.
There we go.  Ooh, that takes care of that.  And in three, two, one.
SpongeBob.
No buns? Drat the luck.
Oh, no, you don't.  You have to eat it on the premises.  Them's the rules.
So.
You gotta swallow it here on the premises.
What is it, lad?
It warms my heart to see that little twerp fail. Okay, boyo, fun time's over.  Now go fish them buns out of the toilet. Oh, yeah  and put these seeds back on 'em.
Why, Christmas is me favorite time of the year! After all, 'tis the season of gettin'!
Exactly! The more you give, the more  get.
What's goin' on out here? Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob.
Will you get some nerve, SpongeBob! This is comin' outta yer salary!
You ain't kiddin'. Here he comes now!
Me secret formula? How did you get that?
Huh?  Get out of me pocket, ya foul goblin!
Hand it over,Sheldon. Don't make it any worse.
Woo-hoo! Got it! Hey, who are you calling cheap?
Sooo, we're having a slow day. At least Old Jethra has stuck with us. That Krabby Patty hitting the spot, Jethra?
(shocked by what he heard, his eyes, claws, and feet exploded. He then regrows his eyes but in an angry mood) Time to get to the bottom of this.  Oohh, just act like your another fancy customer.
: Shh!  What's gotten into you? High-faluting customers don't bark at the top of their lungs likea seadog.
Good evening, Madam. Table for two, please?
I be Eugene Krab....er....I mean, uh,  Sir Krumple O'Wrapper. Uh, that's my name. Don't wear it out.
Reservation? In this sinkhole?!
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Better than a Krabby Patty?
This is delicious! No!!!!!! I'm ruined!
I figure it's the least I can do for him after causing all that mayhem over at the Chum Bucket. In fact, I promoted him. He's our new doormat!
Gotcha! Whoa! You're a big one! Can't believe I've never seen you in the Krusty Krab before!
I've been conducting a little research! Where's Squidward?
You two! Follow me!
I want you to take a look at these folks right here. Have you ever seen any of them in the Krusty Krab? Think hard?
How about you, Squidward?
Well, according to my research, a full 2% of the population of Bikini Bottom has never set foot in the Krusty Krab. That's 2% of money that's not in me pocket. And when I see that 2%, I get soooooo maaaad!
I'm not talking about pie!  These holdouts are probably spending their money in some other restaurant! We need to find that 2% and reel them in. So I want you two to promote the Krusty Krab!
Over-what who?
I don't know what you're doing, boy-o, but it's working like cake busters. This place is as packed as the trills-with-gills. In fact, I'm seeing some of the same holdouts I saw this morning
Oh, don't worry about that, boy! Squidward's holdin' down the fort!  You just keep doing what you're doing and bring in that last 1%!
Great! This is a dream come true! SpongeBob, get back behind the grill, and Patrick, buy something or get out!
That's him! Let him in! It's the last 1%.  Gotcha!
That'll be 50 bucks!  This advertising campaign has really paid off!
Hmm. What could be the doings of this stranger?
Its true.
Which one of us is gonna get bulldozed?
I'm not going anywhere!. You're the one who is moving!!
Ohoho no you are!
Pack your bags pipsqueak!
At least i have customers.
Ha! Good luck with thatludicrous idea! .  Petition?  Squidward! SpongeBob!
You two take these petitions to save The Krusty Krab and secure as many signatures as you can!
I...I...uh... My...my patties are dangerous because...because they're so...uh...uh...they're so-
Thanks for saving me shell, boy!
Hmm... Now there's something you don't see every day.
Not him. I'm referring to the large crowd gathered at the Chum Bucket. It appears they are actually giving Plankton... MONEY?!
This is outrageous!  You see what Plankton's doing, don't ya? He's undermining the democratic process by lab raging his temporarily financial windfall in order to buy every signature in Bikini Bottom.  There's 20, 40, 50... We just bought mine 4 times! And me tasty food is one thing.  But how can I compete with free money?  I'm doomed! Well... clean around, boy. Border up. I'm afraid we're closing up for good.
It's time.
But... but...   No! I'm not going anywhere!
If you wanna bulldoze me restaurant,  it's gonna be long and painful!
I'm never leaving the Krusty Krab!
Goodbye, Krusty Krab!   Eh?
Uhh... yeah.
Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I surely break out in a rash!
Wait, I saw it first! Hah!  Mine, mine! Huh?!
What's this? Where are the doubloons?
Have you finished cleaning the tables?
Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?
Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.
Patrick, you're fired!
Would you like a job, starting now?
You're fired!
Shiver me timbers!
Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.
Treasure.  There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.
Can't you see we're closed?! Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!
Six! One, two...  I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.
Oh, you can't walk out on me now.
C'mon, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.
Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure.
That's awful lad. If the Dutchman hears ya, we'll never get his treasure.
I'll roll for ya boy.
Eight paces, now that's a good start lad.
One, two, three...
A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  Avas! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.
It's Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.
Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?
Ay, ay, ay. Relay that skipping. Pirates don't skip.  Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.
Now, don't you feel more like pirates?
Arrgh!  Keep a sharp lookout. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.
Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.
Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, "okie dokie, then." A pirate says, "arrgh!"
Out with it man, arrgh!
ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?
Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.
Answer Patrick. Which was is east?
9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the "X"? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east.
Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?
That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. 9,551... 9,552...
Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew,[one of SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears, as he was getting ready to cry] what am I captain of? Just a bunch of sand!
You'll stay with me then?
I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!
[] Do you think this is a problem?
Sneaking peeks at me treasure?
That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?
I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!
"X" marks the spot!
Well, what are you waiting for lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
Ha, ha. Hand it up to me lads. Heave!
We finally found it.
What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!
Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!
All for one.
All for one.
All for one.
All for one.
All for one.
They did!
Wait! I'm captain of this crew. Where's my reward?
Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.
Did someone said money? I could swear that's what I heard! I got super sensitive hearing when it comes to that word!
Excuse me, Colonel! I'll be taking over from here on out!
Thanks for all the great tips! I think you should be on your way! Good bye! Good luck! Have a nice day! SOOO!!! What are we waiting for? It's high tide time we went on tour!
Up and at 'em boys! We got a tour to put on!
Mornin' Squidward!  Tour bus, sound equipment, check! All I need now is a...roadie? Now where in Neptune how I'm ever gonna find...
Roadie! Check!
Here we are boys! Our first gig! All those people are lined up to see you!
Alright roadie, start unloading the hooey!
Anywhere is fine.
Well that's very interesting Colonel Carper! But right now, my band and I are on a world tour! And tonight we're opening for Ned and the Needlefish!
Yeah...eh, what's so funny!?
We have a tour bus, sound equipment, a roadie!
AHHHHHHH!!!!
Wait a minute...what's that gonna cost me?
Deal!
Ok Mr. Squidward. Take it from the top!  Doggonit...
Well, here we are! Our next gig!
Sorry Squidward but that is physically impossible!
Because it's not there anymore!
I pawned it! To raise the cash for the concert tour!
Yeah...hard to believe, I know! My heard aches when I think of me old girl cold and lonely. Just sitting in the front window of that dirty pawn shop at the mercy of any random joe who just happens to pass on by.
Hey! Now quit your worrying back there! With the success we're about to have, we'll be able to buy ten Krusty Krabs!
What a happy celebration!
Thank you Mr......Supermarker Manager.
What's this? Our pay check?
WHAT!?
Oh don't worry Squidward! These geezers really know how to party!
Uh...not too much farther Squidward! Uh...oh in fact, we're just entering it now!
This ain't our next concert!
It's uh...uh...um... Well it's right over there obviously!  I'll just leave the three of you right here to set up! I some important tour management business to attend to if you know!
Do I know you?
Were we in the Navy together?
Phew, that's good! 'Cause for a second there I thought that we maybe...
Wait a minute! Where'd you think you're going with your own equipment!?
' ' How'd the show go boy?
Quick! On the bus!
Now I'll never get me ol' Krusty Krab out of hog!
Good news boys! We only sustained a flat tire! Patrick, go get the spare lad!
But Mr. Squidward!
WAHHH!!!!!  But I don't have any money lad! Not even a nickel! It's all gone! Me Krusty Krab is gone!!!
Unbelievable! They actually gathered a crowd! To think that all of these people came out to the middle of the desert to see Squidward and SpongeBob!
Thank you! Come again please!  He he he!
That's nice! I just made more money than I know what to do with!
Who?  Get Paid Back from Mr. Krabs Line starts here...
Why'd I owe you money for!?
I don't owe you a nickel!
Collecting time!?
Well Krusty Krab, this is good bye... WHY!? WHY!?
Well, SpongeBob! You ready to get back to doing what we do best?
That's me boy!
Mr. Squidward, what's with all the dilly-dallyin'? We got customer's money  to take!
Where is everybody?
Patrick! I knew our number one customer wouldn't let us down.
Patrick-Man? What kind of ridiculous name is that?
Please ma'am, allow me.
Hehehehe, not a problem ma'am. It's the least I can doooooo!  Sorry, lady, you're on you're own.
Oh, sweet dollar. Oh, just look at you. So clean. So crisp. Now come to Krabsy.
But I found that dollar!
Whaaaaaaaat?! Alright, that does it!
Enough!  We've all had our fill of Patrick-Man!
Sure you were.  What the barnacles are you doing?
You've disabled my employees and trashed me restaurant?! Think you might go for the Bubble now?
Not so fast! I think I need you to use your superpowers one last time.
Hey now! Let's not say things we might regret later! Tell you what,  you come back tomorrow and SpongeBob will make you a proper milkshake.  Alright! See you tomorrow!
I'm taking you back to school!
There you are boy!  The Milkshake Academy! You know boy? Milkshaking technology and know-how is advanced since you were last a cadet!
Where'd you learn those moves, SpongeBob?
It's 1 minute till opening time. Where are me employeries? I don't pay them to be late.
SpongeBob, Squidward, enough duff-dragging! Get to your stations, pronto!
I don't care if he has seaweed-for-brains. He needs to be behind that register. We've got customers out there just begging to hand me their money.
No buts! Get to work, you two!
All right! That's enough, you two. Time to serve some customers!
Hop to it, lads. We haven't even taken our first order!
What in blazes is going on he...... Whoa! Mr. Squidward!  Where are your manners?
Watch his head? Why don't you watch his diaper?  And get it changed!
Are you out of your ever-living mind?! We can't change that baby out here in front of the customers! Take him in back where the food is prepared.  Oh, that's it! Get that poopy baby out of me restaurant!
What's all the ruckus!?
What are you talking about? The Krusty Krab is a standard in fast food cleanliness! An urchin wouldn't dare step hide into this establishment.   The grill is still on...isn't it?
Hold it right there!  Gotcha you prickly pest!  Woah! Woah! Woah!
Plankton!? Ah that's all we need. Beat it ya crook! We have enough pests already!
Hmm...it may take a pest to catch a pest.  It's a deal but no tricks, or you'll be the chef's special!
That piece of junk!?
Oh no, you don't!  Grrrrr.....  Mallet please!
You think? SPONGEBOB!
That little monster's still in there. You open the register, and I'll catch him in here
ME MONEY!!!  Did I get it!?
Cactus?
Spoon?
Plankton?
Spray can?
Hmm...I think our darling little decoy still needs something...
Now get in there, Planktonella, and lure that little rotten health hazard out of me livelihood!
Psst! Go on, Plankton! Make with the romance!
Get ready! Here they come!
Holy mother of Pearl! Batten down the hatches!  It's a stampede!
Ah, who cares about Plankton? What about me restaurant?
Hey! What do you know! That seems to be slowing 'em down! Better crank it all the way down, just to be on the safe side!  That outta do it!
Here goes nothing!
I don't care. As long it's far away from the Krusty Krab.
Keep going!
Farther!
No! Farther!  Well, that takes care of that particular problem!
Krusty Krab!
Not far enough! Keep going!
(screams and yells) SPONGEBOB!!!!
Not bad. If only I could paint him smaller.
What is it!?
Tonight eh? That doesn't leave me much time! This is gonna be close, but we'll be ready for them!
Don't worry SpongeBob! We're ready for 'em!
They got past me! Me restaurant!
Plankton! Don't do it!
SpongeBob warned me you're planning a jailbreak so I took the precaution of hiding the entire Bikini Bottom Police Force in me safe!
Well, thanks to your hard work, the Krabby Patty recipe is safe!
Yep! I'm a winner!
Just a couple more additives, SpongeBob.  Oh and try not to breathe the fumes.
Barnacles, no.  The customers keep passing off their dirty money. So we're cooking up the only solution powerful enough to clean it.
Hold on, kiddo. We still have one more ingredient.
Careful, SpongeBob! Just two drops and that stuff could...
...blow our faces off.
We can get it later.
What's all the ruckus?
Pull yourself together, boy. So your spatula snapped. Go get yourself a new one!
Quit that, boy. It's creepy. Spatulas can't talk. And if I catch yous talking to your next one, I'll lock you up in a padded kitchen.
You're gonna be missing a job if you don't get in that kitchen. The lunch rush is nigh!
All right, good night, boyo. Headin' home. Thanks for all the extra greenbacks you earned me today.
Ooh, that's great SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. What did I tell ya about talking to spatulas. Only do it if it makes me money.
Hey, whatcha doin', boy?
SpongeBob, no! Uh, I mean, it was your talkin' spatula, you say? That you got from Plankton? Well, why didn't you say so?  Here. Give your talkin' spatula this recipe.
Just read it.
Oh, it's not... Plankton.
Quite a volatile concoction, eh, Planky?
You got that right, boyo.
Thank you, come again!  Hey, who turned out the lights?
Why in the world would I want to do that?
Oh, yeah? Well, I can't see nothing from down here!
I won't be blackmailed! There's no way I'm giving you me secret formula!
But I don't wanna!
Ok, I'll do it.
Here. I hope you choke on it.
Don't worry. He's about to get what's coming to him.
Well, darlin', it's like this: Where you see disaster, I see dollar signs. So, SpongeBob, you got any of that bubble soap left?  Please have your money ready!  Thank you!  Right this way.
"Instant interest"?! Well, that's practically giving money away!  SpongeBob! You're in charge while I run down to the Bank of Bikini Bottom Bank! I gotta get down there before they run out of dough!  Money, here I co... Huh?
I'M IN MONEY HEAVEN!!!
Yeah, hi! I want to see all of your money!
Show me where the money lives! I'd bet you got a lot!  I'd like to see all of it! I'm a huge fan of money!  H-Hey! Get your hands off...   Anchovies...
Good day, madam! I would like to take a look at your safe, please!
Not again...  Scallops!
Good day, gentlemen!
Hello,  young missy!
So far so good...
They haven't thrown me out yet...
It's all coming together now...
Oh, yes! I'll have that please!
Oh, of course!  Here's me prized penny deposit it into a new account!
WAIT!!!  Uh, what you're doing? Penny doesn't want to be crammed in there with all those other coins. She wants a money condo of her own!
Oh, yes! Penny will have one of those!
Wait! Can it...have one moment with me penny? Alone?
Oh, penny...I'll miss... It's inhuman I tell ya! Penny, penny...one last kiss goodbye.  It's just you and me now little penny! It's a wee bit cramped in here!
Gasp! This can't be true!  'Tis true! I landed in money nirvana!  Me wildest dreams finally come true!
Well, time to head home!  Whoo hoo! I hope to see each and every one of ya on the outside!  Balmy! I'm locked in!  I guess I'm trapped here all night!  With all of this moolah! Such much moolah...  I have no one to tell about it! Time to russel up me some friends!
You look absolutely stunning tonight, Mrs. Greenback. Waiter!  Oui, oui, monsieur, what can I get you and zee lady tonight?  The lady would like to start with a million clams. A side of investments, and hold the taxes. I'll have the same. But with extra no taxes. Eh. Such a friendly fella. Good lookin' too. I'm almost gonna regret not giving him a tip.  Hello?
I'm fine boy! In fact, I'm dancing with a beautiful lady.
Yes, and she's made entirely out of money.
I'm locked in the bank vault, and having the time of me life. Oh, and I think I'm running out of oxygen, and it's making me lose me mind.
Ah. This is the life.  Sun, sand, and surf. And of course. Mrs. Greenback by my side. What's that? Eh, don't start on me now. I'm sure this remote island has a food source! Krabs just hasn't found it yet, that's all. I'll just eh. Heh heh. So hungry.
Ohhh! So hungry!  Oh, why did I come to this uninhabitable island? Why did I do it? Why did I say all that to Mrs. Greenback? I miss her why isn't she? Miss Greenback! Where could she be? What have I done?  Ms. Greenback! Oh, Ms. Greenback.  You're okay! I was so worried.  What's this?!! Ah! Little miss! What the Neptune?!!  A slimy money dragon! You're not sucking away me fortune without a fight!  Gimme back Mrs. Greenback you beast!
I got you now, money sucker! That is it, you nimbrid! It's you, or me now! Just you and me!  I concurred the money dragon! It's history! Woo hoo!
You know, boyo. Through this whole ordeal, I've learned a little something about greed. A little something about isolation. Heh. Even a little something about love. And you know what I realized through it all?
Barnacles no, boy! I realized that they didn't pay interest on me deposit!  Hey, you cheapskates! Gimme me interest!  Well. What do you know? I doubled me money.
What's the big kurfuffle? Oh, it's you. Only what's on the menu, old-timer!
Because we never did. That sandwich was on the menu of an old restaurant that lay here a long time ago! Twas' an old ramshackle shack called Rusty's Rib Eye, and the only one who ever knew how to make that sandwich was the owner, Rusty Rickets. However, old Rusty bought the farm 20 years ago.
Nope. You're not getting that recipe unless you're versed into talking with the unliving.
Err... Scram. This conversation's making me dizzy.
Good night, kiddo.
Fine. But no eating me inventory.
Or me furniture.
You better have a darn good reason for getting me outta bed!
Looks like a certain foolish sponge has been conversin' with the unliving! All right you floating nuisances! Time for the bossman to mop up!  Batter up! H'ya!  Yeah, and go back in which ye came!
Never hold a seance boy-o... without me permission, because ghosts are like relatives. Once you let them in, they never leave!
What's going on around here?
Kenny the Cat? What in clams' name is a... "the cat"?
No.
Uh, no.
Me wallet?! What's he been doing in there?
Oh,  Kenny the Cat. Well, he's a sensationality.
Hundreds, you say?
What an excellent idea, SpongeBob! "A clean cat is a moneymaking cat," I always say. Please yourself of the lounge facilities.
Ah, the cat of the hour is back!
All right, you ready to sign for these fine dollarsI mean, uh, suckersI mean, uh,some autographs?
Well, alrighty then. That's what the consuming public wants to hear.
Squidward!
My problem is that you aren't workin'! Which means I lose M-U-N-E-E! Which means you lose your J-O-B!
Tentacles, I mean it!  You get back to mindin' that register!
I see your point. But still, I'm not paying you to dream sweet nothin's! Do something! Pick up a mop, a broom, uh, a window wiper, a spatula, even!
That's a perfect example of what I'm talkin' about! Stayin' busy!
Okay, have it your way, Squidward! Since you can't be bothered to take the initiative yourself, it's clear I must assign tasks to you. Hmm... Mr. Squidward, scrub the walls of the Krusty Krab 'till they gleam!
Well, that's very nice, boy, thank you. But, you see, I'm tryin' to give Squidward a task.
Excellent idea, Mr. SquarePants! Squidward, I'd like you to sweep--
Oh, is that so?  Perhaps you'd prefer scraping the gum off the underside of these tables!
I guess SpongeBob has a handle on all the Krusty Krab duties. Which leaves you with all the extracirculars!  Like shinin' me shoes!
Wash me boat!  Listen, Squidward, I'm gonna get a full day's work out of you one way or another.
Oh-ho, yeah? Fine...if you refuse to work, then I can't be held responsible.
For...for...  ...a visit from...the Yeti Krab.
Yeah. Everyone's heard of the abominable Yeti Krab...  ...with his long, wide hair, and six-pack abs...  ...and yeller' teeth! And everybody knows that he only comes out of his mountain cave to feed on lazy workers.  He's attracted to the scent, he can smell your lazy, lazy stench from hundreds of miles away!
Yes, but that won't make any difference because of your proximity to Squidward's laziness. You  be eaten!
You won't think so if that big, hairy fellow wants to eat ya!  Yeah. Now, listen up, boys! Bossman Krabs is steppin' out for a minute.  But I want this tub of laundry done before I come back, or...
Precisely. See ya, boys!
I'm back, fellas!
Uh, Squidward?
We're as good as Yeti food! I blame Squidward!
Way to go, boy! He loves it!  And look, he's a paying customer.  Come back and see us anytime, Mr. Yeti Krab!  Hey, what are you two doing standing idol? Squidward, sweep out the crow's nest!
Refinish me floors!
Build me a new safe!
Well, hurry up lads! We can't squat like this forever!
Well, actually, SpongeBob, uh, there's two words. And they're not very good. You're fired.
Well, you see, I've been doin' some calculatin' and, you know, crunching the old numbers. And it turns out that I'll save a whole nickel if I cut your salary. Completely.
Yeah, I looked into that. Apparently, it's  "illegal". And I'll lose my "vendor's license". Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
You know I love you like a son. But you can't argue with a nickel.
I'm afraid not, Squidward. You've got seniority.
Nope, it's gotta be you, son. You're canned.  Here's your pink slip.  I'm giving you the ax.  You're fired.
So, uh, if you could just hand over your spatula. Um... I'll just take that.
I'll also need the hat. Allow me.  Go ahead; take a moment to collect yourself. Long as you need.
Squidward, I'll have you know,  I was five times "golden spatula" in the navy,  so I'll be runnin' the grill.  Ooh!
Wait! Come back!  That was me last customer.  SpongeBob?  Squidward, you found him!
Oh, laddy.  I shoulda never let you go. The Krusty Krab has fallen apart without you. You're rehired, boy.
Well, SpongeBob, it looks like things are back to normal. And to make up for that extra nickel I was losing, I installed a pay toilet.
Yoo-hoo!
Well, look at this. Lazing about.  Can I get you anything else, another pillow, maybe? A cappuccino machine?
Oh, for kelp sake. You're a lost cause.
What are you doing, boy?! You're scaring all me customers with your foul stench!
Oh no, lad, you're not coming in here looking like that!  You're going straight home for a nice long bubble bath!
Yes it is. And consequently, you are just neat as a pin! Now get to work!
There you go!  Now get to work!
Oh no! It says "Buy one for a fee!"
And how is everything for you today, sir?
Fine, fine.
Yeah, okay, always nice to hear.
You must've paid five times the price of a regular patty for that!
Argh!  Me eyes! What are you doing, Mr. Squidward?!
All right, that's enough. Patties with emotional flavors...  ...it's two bits extra. Now pay at the register. What in Davy Jones' locker is going on in here, Mr. Squidward?!
Well, we can't have that. He's me best employee. Well, no offence.
Melancholy and self-doubt are bad for business. Make a note of it.
Avast there, lad!  You're wasting your valuable tears, salting me patties with grief.
There, there. Failing your driver's test is nothing to cry over.
How much do they charge you at this driving school of yours?
$100 a semester?!  Well, I can do it for double the price and half the time!
Sure, I taught me own daughter Pearl how to drive like a little angel.
Sure, anything for me little angel Pearl.
Why, I couldn't be sure, lad. You don't need a...  "professional"to teach you how to drive.
Wipe that boating school malarkey out of your mind, son! It's all a racket.
And that goes for every kind of schooling. Why, there ain't nothing truly important, you can't learn on the streets with half a jigger of common sense and your own two claws. Now, put 'er in gear!
Well, rookie mistake, boy. It happens all the time.
No, but you got the right fire in your belly.
Yeah. Well, you know, what we need is a change of venue.
This empty parking lot is just the ticket.  Like every young person, the novice boater needs plenty of open, obstacle-free space and the freedom to make mistakes.
Can't disagree with you there. All right, put 'er in gear!  Hmm.
I suppose so. Now slowly inch forward and we'll check out the damage.
Oh, broken wall. That's about $15,000. Oh, kitchen fire. Oh, that'll be about 6 grand.  Ooh, lawsuit? Oh, that's a lot of zeroes! Ugh.     Bleah!
Now, here's a place you should be comfortable with.
Just take a look around, boy-o: home sweet home. Nothing to make you twitchy and jumpy. Oh, just the opposite, in fact. A place so soothing and sweet, like a mother's gentle lullaby on a soft summer's night.  Oh, brother. Let's start with something simple: a little trip down the street to Patrick's house.
Upsell!
Better.
Okay, that was just fine, but next time, wait until I say, "Put 'er into gear."
A simple trip to Patrick's house: a line so straight and true.
Well, we, you know, we could do that. But you can't learn to drive without a boat. Or can ye?
You'll certainly learn the way of the boat with this here top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art technological simulator.
Now hand me one of them tokens. You'll need your protective headgear.
Great job, boy.
Saw that coming.
No, no. It's my fault. We've been going about this all wrong, boy. It's not a pampering you'd be needing. It's a bold and reckless display of confidence!
You think when I was your age, I tip-toed around like a tadpole on a petunia?
That's right. My style was to dive in with both feet, claws snapping.
Thar she blows. The dreaded double roundabout, the most treacherous stretch of road in all of Bikini Bottom. To your starboard, you yield. To your port, they yield to you. And when you're in the middle, it's every man for himself and the devil take the rest!
Nonsense, boy-o. All it takes is some confidence and a little coordination. Why, your little pet snail could do it.
Oh, he's colorful, all right. But he's also going to teach you how to drive. Now, go!  Atta boy! ] There you go, SpongeBob. Did you see how Gary did that?
Buck up, me boy-o.  It's  turn next.
Not really.
Why, yes. Yes, officer, it is.
You sure did...uh, I mean, you didn't...I mean, well, no...I mean, well, yes...I mean, uh, look, it was just a friendly, little example: a colorful example.  I was teaching the lad to drive.
Well, I mean, really, he has more on top of the wheel.
Quiet, boy! Let me handle this.
Well, no. But I taught me own little girl to drive, you see, and you understand. Do you have any kiddies of your own at home, officer?
Oh. Well, um...you two seem very happy together.
This ticket's coming out of your paycheck, boy.
Ha! What could be worse than spending money?
: Alright, hold on a second there free-loader! What are you doing here?
: Did you bring money this time?
: Let me see that.  Alright. Pay is real. Now get in line!
:  What are you doing throwing away a perfectly sellable sandwich?!
I smell something burning.
Oh, stop your drama, Squidward.
What in the name of Neptune's tail fin is going on in here, boy?
Mmm-hmm. Sounds to me like you're wasting me precious ingredients! Listen SpongeBob, just because there's no customers doesn't mean you can't do something productive.
Well, I mean you could, OH! You can dust the pickles! Or uh, alphabetize the buns! Ehhh, you could, uh... water down the ketchup!
Whatever. Now if these little fellers could work... maybe you'll be on to something... hey, you couldn't make me a little tiny army of unpaid workers, could ya?
Ohhohohohoo! Hi Pete!
Hey, what's wrong with Pete? He's not working!
Well now, that shouldn't interfere with Pete's work.
No! Not his productivity!
No! Not leaving the workplace for pleasure!
Company picnic?
Gee, SpongeBob. Do you think if I threw a picnic your productivity would increase?
Just in time, Mr. Squidward! You're about to go on the greatest company picnic ever!
Yes, yes it is.
Oh, don't think of it as just toilet paper, it has thousands of uses.
Right you are! Here's the food!
Oh, you're confused? Let me show you a little hack.  See? You open it with your teeth.  There, isn't that fun? And afterwards, you can toss it around like a, you know, one of those things you toss around.
Here let me show ya. Go out for a long one, SpongeBob!
Ho, ho. This is so much fun.
I can't hear what you're sayin'! So... here it comes!
Hmm. Heh, I don't see it anywhere.
Oh no you're not.  You're going to sit right there and enjoy yourself until your productivity increases!
Well, we sure had our fun and games today. But just maybe we've learned a little something too. About each other and ourselves. I guess you'd have to say, "This was the greatest..."
"The greatest comp..."
"The greatest company picnic ever!"
Well, looks like we've got company.
I have? Wait. Oh yeah.
"Chumpany Picnic"? That's not how you spell "Company Picnic"!
Plankton!
Just what do ya think you're doin', Plankton?
Oh yeah! Well, it's my spot now!
You don't even have any employees!
Ha! Go on, SpongeBob! Show this upstart how we chuck the old mustard plate around!
Now, look here, Plankton! Me loyal employees would never be takin' in by such a shallow display...
Is this backwards?  Oh, that's not it either.
SpongeBob, would you mind helpin' me with my zipper?
Huh? Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Well, I don't know.
Ooh. I think this mayo has gone bad.
Yeah.
You wanna join in all that fun over there with Mr. Squidward, don't ya?
Are you sure you don't want to?
You sure?
Ok, then. I'm outta here! See ya! Yahoo!
You can never have too many!
Hey, Squiddie-bird!
Ooh!  Me first! Me first!
That's such great advice!
My candied pen!
Whew! That was a cl...
You saved me, boy. How did you do it?
Alright, enough relaxin'. Back to work!
Nope. Nothing.  I can't smell a cent or a dollar. Or any money in a 5-mile radius. We might as well settle down early.  Just as soon as that guy finishes his meal.
When he goes, you can go.
Oh my! That's quite a storm! You know, a storm like this puts me in the mind of me old navy days.
That gives me a fine idea, SpongeBob. Since it looks we're gonna be stuck here for a while, why don't you pull up a barrel, me laddies? While I retell you a thrillin' tale of me mysterious salty past.  There, now. The lights are properly dimmed.  Feast yourself on these slightly expired soda crackies  as I explain ya the yarn that puts hair on your chest.
It was a day just like this one. The wind was howling!  And me ship was being tossed about, like a rag doll on a trampoline!  I was in the galley! Cooking up grub for me crew to keep their mind off this horrible squall!  It was just then that he bursts into the galley!
The man whose mission was to make my life a living nightmare!  The roughest, toughest, scaliest old barnacle that ever roamed the briny deep! He was me commandin' officer and he loathe me with the white, hot hatred of a psychotic madman!  They called him,  Captain Scarfish!
Oh, that sir? Why sir, that's a sea-cucumber sandwich, sir, with the crusts cut off, sir. A little booshie-amusie for the boys, sir.
But that's... That's madness!
But I don't know how!
I don't see what's so amusing about that, Mr. Squidward. We were a cargo ship  heading straight into pirate territory with a fresh supply of suntan lotion for shipwreck sailors whose skin was chafed.  Chafed, Mr. Squidward!
Aye, sir! I understand, sir! Chafed!
Aye, sir!
Aye-aye, sir!
Aye-aye, sir!
Yes, sir.
Oh, don't "huzzah" yet, boys.
Slop.
Oh, sorry boys.  Captain's orders.  Oh, I can't stand it!  I don't care what the captain says!
Oh, nothing sir! Uh, they just really enjoy eating slop! Don't you, boys?
Cherries jubilee.
Well, flaming cherries jubilee.
Well, you see, sir, I was just gonna take this here match and...  And so, I found meself in the brig with two guards watching me every move.  The one was as brutal and ugly a bounder as you ever wish to see in your darkest nightmare!
But I thought I could dupe the other one sure than need a rise.
I managed to worm some useful information out of him right away. You see, he was an aspiring cook and I talked him into seeking some things down into the brig for me. The tombs of me trade you might say.  I set him to work on a sponge-sugared cathedral that took up most of his attention.  He never suspected that I was using the scraps to fashion a candy-key. Where's your sourpuss friend tonight?
Wise lad.  And so, after a few hours of bouncing off the walls, the sugar finally wore off.  And soon, he was napping like a baby. This was me chance to use me sweet key to freedom.  But did I dare take it? I'd be in violation of the naval code. Then something happened that made me mind up for me.  Pirates! We were under attack!  I had to act fast!  Wake up, lad! Wake up! Man your battle stations!  I was on me own.  I could see it all. A pirate ship! And on that island: a crew of five naval men! Our only hope, marooned on a beach by those same scurvy pirates!  And suffered from the effects of chafe! Sunburn!  The pirates had already launched a boat and were preparing to board our vessel!
Listen to me, Captain! This is gonna get real ugly real fast! We've got to get to the cannons!
Then listen carefully! We'll have to go down to the cargo-hold and poke holes in the barrels of suntan lotion and scuttle the ship!
What are you using for ammo there, Ensign?
That's it!  Come with me, lad!  Direct hit!
Get down to the cargo-hold and check on the captain!  Charge! Hup! Hey! Whoop! Whoa! Hi-yah! Woo!  Close one! Ha-ha!
Hoo! Whoo! Ha-ha! Whoop! Missed me!  Uh-oh! Uh, anyone for cherries jubilee?
Ha-ha! The sunburn brigade!  Ha-ha! Me plan worked! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!
I can't let you go, lass. That'll be violation of the naval code. Enjoy your last meal. I hope you like sponge-sugar!
Squidward, why aren't you taking orders from these good people?
What?! Where's SpongeBob?
Then you'll have to do SpongeBob's job too!
Of course you can. Any idiot can do it. Now, get to work! I'm gonna go find SpongeBob!
Ooh, excuse me, me lovely. Maybe I've got the wrong house here. But I can't say I'm disappointed. I was thinkin' of me old matey SpongeBob...
SpongeBob? That's you, boy? Why aren't you at work? And why are you all dressed up like a nanny puppet subsea hooligowl?
You try?! Listen up, me boy-oh! You'll do more than try! You'll...
Squidward, have you lost your ever lovin' mind? You cannot be sneezin' all over me Krabby Patties! The customers don't like it. Except for that guy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't abandon ship! I have to work all by meself!
Right.
Nope, it's good as that. Not only do I supply the Eating Contest but I get to sell my profilating patties to all the hungry spectators!. I had to grease a few wheels but it was worth it.
Sure thing Mr. Commissioner! See you at Founders' Day!
I wonder how many Krabby Patties I can sell.
What do you mean one!
No takers for "McNulty Challenge". Ha! What's that suppose to mean?
I'm ruined! No-one wants to see a one Krabby Patty Eating Contest, least of all me wallet.
I couldn't give a seafit for Founders Day. I need sales boy, sales is what I need. Oh if only there was someone dumb and hungry enough to take on Ol' Oswald McNulty.
Ah! Dumb and hungry. Well, if it isn't Patrick!
No, no of course you are! How would you like to eat as many Krabby Patties as you can handle and restore the honor of your home town.
I'm talking about Oswald McNulty! He comes here every year with his big city ways and his extremely relaxed throat muscles and he shows us up a bunch of rubes. Rubes! And on Founders Day no less! We need a home-town hero to make me lots of mone- I mean return the belt to Bikini Bottom! He-he, He-he.
You're going up against the best, so you have to be the best! We're gonna light a fire under you boy-o!
Listen up, Mister. No more fooling around, you're here to eat and eat and then eat some more.
Well let's see how your tummy handles these patties Mr. likes-to-eat.
Eat!
What are you doin'? Your wastin' time!
Son, can you eat faster?
Ooh, I didn't know you had false teeth.
Nah, that can't be it, McNulty has teeth. SpongeBob! Let's go to the film.
Look at that devious face, a face without pity, cold dead eyes, like a sharks eyes. What is Oswald McNulty doin' that Patrick Star is not!
Or maybe we should be asking what Oswald McNulty is not doing.
Your both wrong! Or possibly right, I mean I don't know much about his personal life, the point is, he's not tasting boys,  That's where Oswald McNulty has  the edge! Those extra seconds you take to taste a patty Patrick, are slowing you down! From now on  You must put them in yer mouth, then swallow!
Don't act bad bucket boy, we're gonna need  a hundred more patties.
We're gonna teach this sea star, a new way to eat! Without tasting.
Come one, come all! This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday! It's a Founders Day extravaganza! Watch our home town hero, Patrick Star, take on the down the beloved champion from three towns over, Oswald McNulty! And see who takes, The Patty Belt!
Yeah, yeah, that's wonderful, move back. Be sure to bring your friends!
Krabby Patties, T-shirts, conical hats, and, Patrick's chompers!
I smell mutiny, what's going on here?
Oh, no problem,
That, is a bill, for all those Krabby Patties you ate during training.
Well I didn't know either until you decided you weren't doing the contest, and that means all your training patties, just became plain, eating patties. Now if you was to do the contest, I might be inclined to tear up this here little bill, and of course, there are all the people counting on you son.
You made the right choice kid!
What are you doing Patrick? Don't make me charge you for those patties too!
Listen up crew, I have an announcement! Bikini Bottom's new sports stadium will officially be named after this restaurant!
Soon we'll have all the concessions in the stadium! Paying for the naming rights will make me millions!
Not for you! Your tails have to stay here and pay me back some of that money I spent.
While I'm gone, Squidward mans the helm.
Ow!
I sure hope you're right.
Uh, hi.
Ooh! I like that!
Ah, relax. That's what my grandma's dentures are made of.
Heh-heh. Sure do. The Bikini Bottom Mets.
Ok! But you're gonna miss the cheer leaders!
Hmm. Is that bad?
What a bunch of malarkey.
Uhh, excuse me sir, that door is for employees only, ohh! It's SpongeBob!  There's something different about you today? You seem more, able bodied.
So they are! You'll run the register today!  Into the galley with you Mr. Squidward, and start cooking!
Well, look, SpongeBob's got longpants on and you've got.. none!
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah,Alright, alright, that's enough!  I see it was a mistake to put you behind the register! Your just looking to good for such a simple meaning of work!
You should be the maitre' d! Greeting customers when they come in! Charming the pants off of everyone with your longpants!
What's wrong, slick? Your not having trouble with your pants, are ye?
Yeah, you're right, you're too good for this place.
A place called... manhood.
What's goin' on? How pathetic, a man, in longpants, crying.
How can I watch the movie with all this blubbering going on out here?
Oh, for Pete's sake. Sorry 'bout the legs boyo.
Well, good! Now, I want you back on the grill tomorrow morning. And if it makes you feel anymore manly, you can do your grilling outdoors!
Is it true that everything is free?
You said everything was free.
So what you're saying is if I never leave, it will be free forever!
Hey! Join us, boy! Ho-ho! I can't believe I'm allowed to lift these...  really heavy... pieces of metal for free!
Ow!
Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free towels! Free! Free!
Yes! Yes I do!  Because I sincerely want to thank you for a truly life-changing experience! Sucker!
Nice potbelly!
Oh boy! Free soup!  Little heavy on the salt.
Hey, Larry! Thanks for all the free steam! Ha-ha! Sucker.
I think I'm done! Would you mind rubbin' a little butter on me?
Why do you keep doing this, Plankton?
When you mess with me business, ya mess with me money!
'Course it is!  Money makes the world go round, and makes me heart go pound.
If I could, I would.
You still here?
Ohh... another lonely evening... dumpin' trash...  ...alone.  Huh?  Umm...  Hello? Miss?
Ooh, careful now, careful.  Your ink will run.
Heh.  Yeah, well... so, um... what's a nice denomination like  doin'... on a bench like this?
What??  Hey, if I met the scallywag that stood you up, I'd knock him down.  Dooh!
The name's Krabs... Eugene Krabs.  And yours?
You know somethin'?  You look like a million bucks when you smile.  Cashina, would you make this old crab's day  and allow me to take you to a place where you can buy me dinner?
Whoa! Oof!  Allow me.
Ooh. I do have a very  recipe...
...for delicious kisses!  Cashina, would you mind if I kissed you?
Wow, what a woman!
Oh, Cashina...
Oh, no, no!  I was, uh...  I was polishin'... this jewelry... with me... mouth hole... you see.  Like this!  Right, hmm...
Pearl, me little beluga...  I never thought I'd say this, but...  I may have found you a new mom.
Ya know, we're gonna have to have another talk about fantasy and reality.
Well, she's...  ...everything I've ever wanted in a woman.
Oh, don't worry, sweetie. Nothing will ever come between us.  She's here! Out of me way!  Hello, me little money stack.  I want you to meet me daughter, Pearl.
Let me talk to her.
Oh... I haven't been this nervous since me first boatswain's ball.
Hey-hey, you two! How about inviting me into your inside joke? Eh?
Cashina, you know I love ya.  And now me daughter loves ya too. Will you marry me, Cashina?
SpongeBob! You're gonna be me wedding planner.
Great!  Here's your budget.
Cashina, you gave it to my life, but I thought I'd leave the rest of it alone. You showed me once and for all: If money can't buy you love, it can give you love.
Oh, what? Oh, I'll tell you everything. No matter how embarrassed, I went to bed until I was 40. My armpits smell like tarter sauce when I'm afraid.
Oh, OK. Whatever you want, me sweet. Just ask.
The what?
Oh, anything for you, baby. (He looks in both directions, Left and Right) I'm gonna whisper it to you, just in case there's any prying ears out there.
Alright, me sweet. Here it is. (He starts to get emotional) Ugh. I'm gettin' a little emotional. While, I never told anyone the secret... Krabby Patty formula before.  So, here goes.  Erngh.
Plankton?!
You... monster!
I've been alone for so long, and for the first time in forever, I felt for someone. Well, I mean something: A pile of cash with lips. It was all too good to be true. Cashina may have not been real, but me feelings were, weren't they?
Plankton, are you saying it was all just a scheme to you? And you felt nothing?
I have no idea, Pearly.
Yahoo! Oh, this is great news, Pearl, me dear!
Now instead of wasting my precious money on your "clothes" and your "school supplies"...
You can waste your own.
That's the spirit.
I'll miss you around the house.
I was talkin' to the money.
Spongebob, you shifty sea-slacker, have you counted the cups like i told to do?
Well, thank you. That's nice of you to say.
Now back to work!
All right, you boneless invertebrate lazy bones...  Come on.
Flip them patties, boy-o, just like the old days.
I'm sorry, son, but i have a business to run. I'm gonna have to let you go.
Now where's me new fry cook?
There he is. Come on in here.
SpongeBob, you old patty junkie! Welcome home son!
And the winner is... SpongeBob Squarepants and the Sharks!
Wait a minute! I can't afford two SpongeBobs! If this a scheme to collect two paychecks, forget about it! You're getting one paycheck split in two.
[] Mr. Squidward, what the devilfish do you think your doing?!
Under where?
You want me tell you the formula? That's quite a responsibility, laddy.
Well, you make a good point. Lean in boy! []
Woah! You guys are multiplying faster than me moneys! Alright, pipe down! I'm only gonna tell you the secret formula one more time!
So you've all memorized the formula. Now get to work! I have to calculate paychecks.
Well, I did it. I calculated 1 paycheck down into 300 separate tiny checks. Only one of you left? Here.
Wait a minute! What's the matter with you, boy?  You like you slept in a pile of trash!
With my garbage? On my land?! I'll be chargin' ye a reasonable rental fee.
Hmm...your paycheck oughtta cover it!
What'd you catch?
Oh, hold on Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.
You just missed him.
No, SpongeBob, we are not handing out anything free with every purchase! Even the smiles here cost a nickel.
Me cash register, me money.
You know, you're right, SpongeBob.  We will share these magical macaroons with all the folks in Bikini Bottom. You just leave it to me.
Look out, Mr. Squidward, I'll teach ya how to run a cash register.
Huh? More cookies, SpongeBob!
What did we ever do to those fortune cookies to make them lie about us like that?
"Unless you give a tiny copepod the Krabby Patty secret formula, you will die?!"
J-just how true are these cookie fortunes SpongeBob?
"You will die."
Me money!
You're right me boy-o,  I've got to face me fortune.
Oh, this crowd is impossible!
Well, I figured the funeral fortune was phony Plankton.
Nothing Sheldon. Here, have a fortune cookie.
Bump.  When did food get so ugly?
"Lonely Krab Dinner for One: Now 30% lonelier." Eee, can't believe what they're charging for this frozen debris, and I can't believe they're selling so much of it. But it sure is convenient.
SpongeBob, that's a million dollar idea that I just had that you just said before me.
Hello, welcome to my commercial. Would you like the convenience of a Krabby Patty at home, without the hassle of going to the Krusty Krab? Well, now you can.  Have delicious Krabby Patties any time you want.  They're in your grocer's freezer section. Buy them. I want your money! Did you get that, Pearly-girl?
So, Mr. Grouper, what do you think?
Oh, well, okay, Don. Will this make me rich?
Oh.
Ooh. Okay.
Let's just leave it to the professionals, boy-o.
And I've got the perfect guy for the job.
Don, will this commercial really help me make money?
Ooh, I do declare, Mr. Grouper, I believe I have a case of the vapors.
Don.
What? Forget what? What? What?! What are you saying?
How much "a lot more"?
Well, then let's fill her up with filler!
Heh, no, I-I can well, it's just a little tweak, me boy.
Ho-ho, that sounds great!
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's imported. It's spelled "sand" but it's pronounced, "filler."
Huh?
I'm rich, boy-o, rich.
Yes, yes, we can.
Whatcha doing, boy?
Oh, no, you've made your last Krabby Patty.
No, ever.
No, I mean forever and ever. You're fired.
But I'm ready to re-hire you.
Then follow me.
That's right, me boy. It's all history now, but you, you have the most important job of all.  You give tours and sell tchotchkes in the gift shop.
Oh, we've got plenty of Krabby Patties right here in the freezer.
You see? Customers at the museum can cook the patties themselves, like this.
Yeah, it's so convenient, see?
Don't worry, Squidward. You're fired.
Heh! No, you're just fired.
Do you have a ticket, sir? Can't be in a museum without a ticket.
Atta boy, embrace the future!
And here to say a few words is the face of the Frozen Krabby Patty, our own Patrick Star. Come on up, Patrick!
Oh, no!
Well, it's gone. Everything I spent me life building is all gone. I'm ruined.  What?
That's strange.
Mr. Squidward, what is going on in here?
Squidward!
SpongeBob, did you do all this?
But how did you get these customers to eat Krabby Patties? They know they're filled with sand.
Fresh?
No, no I
Here!
Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh, the flavor.  The sweet, greasy nectar of the gods. How much are you charging for these patties, boy-o?
Agh, SpongeBob, me boy, you've done a good thing here, lad, but you could use a little frelp, I think.  How about we partner up, and I become your boss and pay you minimum wage while I work you mercilessly? What do you say?
Great, now get back to work!
And how was your meal today, ma'am?
Well, you're more than welcome to go to each table and tell them about your satisfactory experience.
Oh, that's the way you want it.
Hold on a second! That's me cork board! It's for all me... memos.
Hey, everybody! Our community bulletin board is here! Tell your friends and come on down and use it for the good of me business! Me wallet! Me... I mean the community.
Yes. Yes it is. It's bringing me closer to my favorite part of the community. Their money!
Step aside, boy! You're blocking me money-makin' bulletin board!
Not on my bulletin board!
Pencils, paper! Pencils, paper!
Heh, heh, heh. Why not? And don't forget to feed your hatred with a selection from our menu!
Alright, that's a good one. Heh, heh. Hey, you know all this note-writing must be making you folks hungry. We have a short line at the register.
What? Wait a second. None of you bulletin board browsers are buying me patties!
What?
That's not true!
And does anyone need to buy a pen?
How about some paper?
Tastes like old baseball gloves, do they?
He's a diabolical genius! That's what he is!
Nobody's orderin', son. It's that cursed cork board! I'm gonna take it down! It's nothing but trouble!
Okay, that's it! Everybody out!
We'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!
Oh, excellent option, Mr. Squidward.
This is Maddaddy. I read you, Pineapple1. Any movement?
Shh. Maintain radio silence. Wait a minute. I see something.
I'll tear ya to pieces!
Well, I'm still angry and I need somethin' to calm me down! Ooh!  This knittin' circle oughta do the trick. And you all are joining me! Especially you, Delicate Flower.
Rev your excitement engines, Mr. Squidward!  Do you not know what tomorrow is?
No, that's today! Tomorrow is Food Con!
Mr. Squidward! Food Con is the biggest convention of food fans in the entire ocean!  The best chefs and cooks gather together and compete for the top prize: The GoldenCornucopia!
You darn tootin' it is! And you two will be me right claw men! Eh, could use some extra muscle to set up the booth.  Perfect! Let's hit the road!
As you can see gentlemen, I have spared no expense on our transportation!
Ta da!
And I brought plenty of free samples to sell!
Enough!! You both are barnacles on me brain!
We are not stoppin' 'til we get to Food Con!
Everybody pipe down!!! I don't wanna hear another peep from anyone until we get to Food Con!
Not a peep!
Not a peep!
We gotta get movin'! The judgin' starts tomorrow! Now, since you boys caused the accident, you'll be haulin' the trailer.
Don't eat my patty!
Maybe I could just eat a pickle.
He says "Food Con". But all I hear is "food".
Ooh, good idea. Music soothes the savage beast.
Did I say "soothe"? I guess I meant enrages.
Hey there, boy-oh! I've taken the liberty of creatin' a safe to secure our precious patty.
Just put in right in here. I'll even step away while you do it.
Ok, just do it already!
Enough of this! I am your boss and I order you to give me that patty!
Dig in, boys!
I think mine is mostly stones!
Enough of this!
You can't win Food Con if you starve to death! Now, give me that Krabby Patty boy-oh!
Well, in that case, you leave me no choice. Get him!!!
Shh! Shh! I hear him over there! He's arguing with the patty! Get him!
Don't let him get away!
Get him!
Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry!
Put your truth in, boy! We won!
What's all the racket out here?
I don't know. Me eyes were burnin'! All I saw was a little eyeball and a pair of antenna and...  Plankton!  He's still in there! Alone! With me secret formula! He could be doing anything with it!  He could be reading it!
Give me your hand, boy-oh!  I need to borrow this.  Ok, I'm going in!
Why you little...
Here's another routine! You're the meat in me knuckle sandwich!
Eww.  SpongeBob!
Whew! That was too close my lad. Three more safes and he would've had me secret formula.
Looks like I'm gonna have to beef up security around here.
I'm gonna need you to do me a big favor, laddy.
Take this home with ya and hide it while I reevaluate my security situation.
Pisha! He'll think it's still here! His tiny brain is incapable of the kind of abstract thinking that is required for reflection. Or thoughtful reasoning and deduction. He cannot ruminate.
He cannot define the hypothesis. He's a tired clown. He'll never know it's in your house!
You'll never get me secret Krabby Patty formula, Plankton! Adios!
School is dumb? You've misspelled every word.
I don't know what you're talkin' about, Plankton! Leave me alone!
Just a minute. I think I've perfected the Krabby Patty formula!  Yes! That's it!
Oh! P...P...Plankton? What are you doin' here?
No, please! Not that! Anything but that!
Here you go, Plankton.
Thanks to this here diploma, I'm suddenly smart enough to never give you me secret formula!
Of course it doesn't work like that, you microscopic meathead! I took  accelerated classes and graduated months ago! This diploma is just a formality!
You've finally been schooled, drop-out!
Ah, rip current, schmip current! Ain't nothin'.
Calm your waters.  Me sailor's knee says we're not in danger. See? Now, get back to work!
As soon as you buy some patties to go, you can go.
No takie-backsies! Three Krabby Patties.
Me money detector! Where do ya think you're goin'? Get back in there and spend the rest of your money!
Listen up, everybody! New store policy! All money brought into this store must be spent here!
Oh, tyrant am I? Alright, I'm a tyrant! The worst in all the seven seas! One of 'em!
Pay day's been canceled! Now, hear this! I'm captain of the ship! Captain Krabs! And I say no rip current will ever harm the Krusty Krab!
Darn arthritis!
What's the meanin' of this?
Captain Squidward?
This is mutiny! Listen here, Squidward! Fun is fun, but get me outta here!
You're not helpin', boy.
Um, little help here!
Whoa! Man overboard!
Haven't you forgotten something? I am not captain anymore! Squidward is!
Why would I want to be captain to such a sorry bunch of lubbers? I'm through!
And that's comin' out of your pay!
Beg me.
Not buyin' it.
I don't care.
I said I don't care.
Ha! You lose!
Oh yeah? What's that?
Oh, no you don't! Come here!
Alright, everybody! What am I?
Come on! It starts with a T!
I can't hear you!
Correct! Alright, I'll save ya. But you gotta promise to spend most of your, all of your money right here! Got it?
Hold on to me dime, boy-yo.
Wait a minute! Gimme that!
Well, boy-yo, you believed in me. So, today will be a pay day for you.
You, Ex-Captain Squidward, have gone from pay day to mayday! Mush! Every last one of ya! All the way back to Bikini Bottom!
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off!  All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.
Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking!  Don't worry lad, I have total confidence in you.  Put it all on Neptune!
I lost me bet!
Mrs. Puff, we've been dating for 16 years now. So, I was sincerely hoping that today might finally be the day that...
Can I steal a little kiss?
Come here, you.
What a woman!
Why are all my tables empty? Why am I not makin' money?
Hello?  Mr. Squidward, step into me office.
I'm gonna share a secret with you that I never told anyone.
Don't touch those! They're mint condition! Worth a fortune!
Oh, it's deeper than that.
I sold it meself. It's Captain Tightwad from Issue 53! They say he's a bad guy, but, you know, I think he's just misunderstood.
I have some fabric leftover. So, I made this.
Ahoy, you high-sea halfwits!
Tremble before Captain Tightwad!
Squidward!
What are you waiting for?
Wha... What do ya mean?
Arr... Uh... Hey!
Ha! See? I just stole some money!
Oh, come on! What do... What do I have to do here?
Are you sure about this? Isn't robbing a bank against the law?
And then we can play?
Oh, okay.
Ahoy! Anyone home? It's Captain Tightwad and Doctor Negative! We're here to rob ya! Anyone here? No.
Oh, yeah! Thanks old timer! Um, we're pretending to rob this bank. Where's the tellers? Where's the money?
Ah, barnacles! I've forgot me debit card.
I'm supposed to be the villain, but why do I feel like I'm being robbed?
Eh, okay, Squidward. Playtime's over. This is getting a little intense here.
Maybe I'll just stick to reading comics from now on.
All right, Krusty crew, I want to remind you all that you're representing the Krusty Krabthe greasiest greasy spoon you'll ever have the privilege of serving!
Open the doors and let the consuming commence! I'll be in me office polishing yesterday's booty.
I heard that, Mr. Squidward!
You trying to tell me that was a "complement"?
Well, you got me there. I do love money.  Excellent observation, Mr. Squidward.
Right you are, Sandy. SpongeBob has lost touch with reality. I've seen it before. They call it: the "mocking mimicry madness."
Spread out! All right, you scurvy dogs, SpongeBob needs us, and more importantly, I need himto stop imitating me customers!
The salty tear trail leads right in here.
Hey!
Mr. Krabs is the best boss in the whole ocean!  Oop! Sorry, I mean  Uh
Sure, SpongeBob, I got it right  Oh, no, you don't, Plankton!
That was a pretty good impression, though.
Eh, SpongeBob. Did ya clean out the  Sweet Dutchman's ghost!  When's the last time you took a bath, boy-o? You're riddled with vermin.
If customers find out you're touching patties with your wormy hands, the health department will shut us down for sure.
Oh, they're "lawyering" up, boy-o. They're makin' a legal claim to keep living in your body.
Son, you gotta understand. I can't have you work here in your present filthy "condisherin'."
Oh! That's the last straw! Mr. Squid
And don't come back until you're dewormed!
Oh, come now, Mr. Squidward. Catering is a great way for you to make a little extra money. And me to make a lot!
Any ideas?
Perfect, now get out there and feed the rest of those kids.
Why, of course they're full of germs. They're kids. Why do you think I'm wearing this full-body latex covering?
Hey, I'm not paying you to play hide-and-seek! These children want to be entertained! Get down here!
Okay, birthday boy. Take a swing at that piata, son.
Oof!  Don't hit nice old Mr. Krabs.  It's the piata you want, son.
Me money! Do I look like a piata to you, boy?
Come on, men, let's cheese it!
Yes!
Yes.
Yes.
Indubitably, madam. We are your high-class caterers.
Tuxedos? Oh, just give us a moment to suit up, me good lady.
You.
Ready to serve you, Miss Money Bagser, II mean, ma'am.
We are anything we need to be for me to make this money.
Unless you wanna go back to the kids' party.
That's what I thought. Then start setting up inside.
Hmm, you might be right. SpongeBob, go find something to fancy-up the food.
Good, now I'll just get the lay of the land around here.
Great Neptune's ghost!
Hey, kid, easy, easy. Just calm down, will ya? I got your cake.
Yeah, yeah.  Your birthday cake is right through here.
Won't be seeing him again any time soon.
SpongeBob, were those jewels on the patties?
What the  SpongeBob, you can't just go around taking people's precious jewels!
Don't worry about it. Just tell me where you got them gems from.
Okay.
All right, what did he say? 18 rights, then four lefts, or five? Ooh.
Oh, youget off! Enough of this!
Give me those! Young boy like yourself shouldn't be playing with fireworks. They're too dangerous.
Ooh.
Oh, uh, quick, in here!
Um, yes, ma'am?
Uh, I'll be right down to have a look. Just need to find something here. All right, where was I? Four somersaults and a barrel roll, I think.
Whoa.  This must be the place.  Hello? Ooh.
Ooh-ee. That is one bigwater bed?
Dogfish!
Don't call me that! And stop jumping on that water bed! You'll pop it!
Get over here!
Why, you little
Uh-oh.
Barrel roll, four somersaults!
Look out, flood's a-coming!
Nice doing business with you!
Whoa!
Oh, no.
My check!
Is there something wrong with your sandwich, sir?
Everyone seems to really like the Krabby Patty!
What? That's ridiculous. It's always been the Krabby Patty.
Huh?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!
Well, that's not true! I'm the one who made the SpongeBob PatI mean the Krabby Patty!
Don't you believe in ghosts?
Of course not! But I'll be cooking the Krabby Patties from now on! Krabby Patties  named after me! Mr. Krabby.  Ouch!
Woah!
What? What's wrong with them?
Like they used to be? It's the same formula!
Wait, wait! Please don't go! We're, we're having a two-for-one sale! For every two you buy, you can buy another one!  Oh! Hold on, everybody!  I think I hear SpongeBob's hideous laughter coming from the kitchen!  I'll show you that the customers are always wrong!
Now go ahead! Call attention to me!
I'm ready! I'm ready!
Is everybody enjoying their Krabby Patties?
Ha-ha!  It was  who cooked those patties! You're all enjoying my food!
Oh, no, you don't!
Anyone who wants to leave has to go through  first!
Ahh! Ow! Eee! Hey! Oh! Whoa! Ah! Blazes!
Ow! Eee! Hey!
Wasting your time, boys. You should just take me straight to the morgue. I'm done.
Stop! Stop here!
Make a hole!
Oh, it's delicious.
You deserve your own place.
Ah, what do you need me for? You got everything: a magic touch for cooking, lots of customers, money!
Huh? Hmmm. Well, I suppose I could do some bossing. How's a 99% for me and 1% for you?
Huh?
Well, I do own 99% of SpongeBob's Place so I guess that's a yes. But you'll have to stand in line if you want to place an order!
We've been shut down.
You know, I know of an empty restaurant that's got all its papers in order. We can move in right away.
Yeah, the ghost is gone.
Mr. Squidward!
You know, I've been doing some thinking. You're a big part of this place, boy-o, and I believe I should share the name with you.  Take a gander.
Well, climb up there! Get a closer look.
Under the words, "Krusty Krab!"
No!
What goes on, boyos?
Why does he want to do that?
That's not how life insurance works.
Course not!  Life insurance is money the beneficiary gets when a person dies. By the way, who gets the money?
Hooray!  Eugene H. Krabs. Go, Squidward!  Yay! Fly high! Do or die! Preferably the latter.
Oh, hey there, boyo! Lovely day for a boat wash!  Isn't it?
Whoa. Maybe I shouldn't have borrowed Pearl's shorts.
They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes.  The hooks! The hooks!
The hooks! The hooks!
The hooks. So there I was minding my own business...
Fine, but don't say I didn't warn ya.
The hooks, me bucko. They're back. Beware the hooks.
Aye.  The hooks. They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey they grab you by the britches...  ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher   until you're hauled up to the surface flopping and gasping for breath. And then they cook ya, and then they eat ya, or worse...
Gift shops.
There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen. Time is money.
Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taking a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59.  Now, what were you saying?
Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues.  Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget.
They should be right here.
The hooks! No! No! No!
Wait! Wait!
Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! [] If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd...  ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
And do you know what happens when you  float back down?
Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna.  With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise.
I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
I need a sailors promise. Repeat after me: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go.
Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!
Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap.
Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you lade?
Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
There's only one thing to do, boy.
Uhh...lad?
I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob.  But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
Gotcha!
I'm off to make a delivery.
Gotcha!
Pull!
Yee-haw!
Gotcha!
Gotcha.
Gotcha.
I'll believes it when I sees it.
Hey, ha ha!  All hands on deck, SpongeBob!
That'll be the day! I don't trust Plankton as far as I throw him! That's why we're gonna shadow that little twit and find out what he's up to!
Snap your trap, boy-o! You'll blow our cover!
Believes it when I sees it.
Quick, boy, he's getting away!
You see there, lad? Plankton is up to no good! I bet those are all the fixings for another evil lab.
You see? He's got an evil belt to match those evil shoes!
His plan!  Did you hear that, SpongeBob? He said, "plan!"
Ooh, this is it, boy-o. He's got an evil laser death apparatus contraption ready to spring on all of us!
Ooh.
Now that I sees it, I believes it.
Oh.  Good luck on your retirement, Plankton. I won't give you any more trouble.
Oh-oh, sure. Whatever you say, old-timer. How would you be doing that when you're all the way over here in Dullsville, hmm?
We never left, Sheldon. The Mr. Krabs and SpongeBoob who followed the robot you to Dullsville were also robots. Gotcha!
Get to flipping those patties fast, boy-o! Before we all become the lunch special!
Get them patties out here fast SpongeBob!  Arrgh!
Huh?  I don't know how you're doing this, boy-o, but keep it up! Folks will pay every cent they have to watch Krabby Patties dance! Look at how cute they are!
We're running out of these dancing patties! Faster, boy-o! Faster!
No! This is gonna cost me money!
Right you are, boy-o!  Here, take this! Here you go! I can't stop!  There you go! What's happening to me?!
Take me money!
Give me back me money!
When I bite into a Dork Krabby Mint Patty, I get the sensation of swimming in money! Piles and piles of it!
Let's see, a five-letter word for happiness. "Money."
Wait! Wait! Don't go!
Wait! Wait, don't go! That's me money walking out the door! What's the meaning of this, Mr. Squidward?
SpongeBob, get out here!  More.  More.  All the way, boy!  What be the matter, SpongeBob? I ought to make you walk the plank for this.
Yes?
Yes, yes, yes?
Out with it, boy!  What is it?
That's all?
I don't wear shoes.
That sounds like me money dropping.  What's going on out here?! My babies!  Get away, you barbarian! What have you done? Nice, clean money... soiled!  I'll take care of ya. Let papa clean ya up.  Clear the way!  No, no, no, don't cry, little ones.
Me dime!   No!  I got it, boy.  What the? It's stuck! You gotta help me, SpongeBob!
I can think of ten good reasons to never let go of a dime, boy. There's got to be another way! Grab me captain's quarters and heave!  Me arms!
Wait.  Squidward... I'm putting you in charge of things around here while I'm gone.
Thanks, Doc.
Time to count me money. My money! Squidward!
Tell me and I'll let you watch as I tear him into a thousand little pieces, mesh 'em back together, and tear him into a thousand little pieces all over again!
Why, SpongeBob?
Well, I'll be a sea monkeys uncle.
Here's another batch, SpongeBob.
Me money never looked better. Thanks, SpongeBob.
I can't swim!
Well, okay.
Thanks, buddy!
Hey, I think I'm swimming!
Perfect.
Wow, that's impressive.
Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention!  Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office!  That will be all.  I have an important announcement to make.
Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulas!
You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast.  It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh...  Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers!
Thar she blows!
All right, men.  Say hello to me Pearl.
It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!
I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me!
Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers?  Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for.
Come on in, me boy! Have a seat.
Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.
Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?
How about my cuddly executive buddy?  Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95.
What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab.  What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers?  How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?!  It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money!  Oh you're right SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?
That's it boy!
You could fire her! It's ok if she hates you.
Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office.
Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen.
Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way?  It's for the best.
I can't let him do this!  Get on with it, SpongeBob!
Oh Pearly...  Is that a 20?  Oh SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood?
Really?
That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man!  But how am I going to get my money back for all this stuff?
Ah, who needs him? I can manage this place and do SpongeBob's job with me eyes closed  and me pockets full.  Here you are, sir.  Whoa!  Sorry about that.  Oopsy.  Phew.  FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!  Okay, maybe I do need SpongeBob.
Not FREE!
AAAAAARRRGH!
They call me "Super Tightwad!"  Here's me bill for services and renders.
No money, eh?
Doing great boys. Just six more years to pay off your debt.
What are you saying, Mr. Squidward? Everyone's money is good here.  At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds.
Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe.  Even if you quit.
One of everything?! Whoopee!  I love Bubble Buddy! Squidward, show our best customer to his table.
Think of the customer.
Mr. Squidward!
So long, boys! You see Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day.
What's this?
He owes me money!
I say we tip something over!
You and that bubble have been nothing but trouble! It's time to end it!
Oh, Nickel Buddy, I'll never spend you!
Uhh, how much are these tin cans gonna cost me?
No thanks, SpongeBob, I'm already not paying  to clean the toilets.
Just fooling sonny, and besides, why would I start saying no to free labor now?
You eat me krusty products, every one you see. From the Krabby Patt-A to the Krabby Patt-Z. Well this here little ditty's a walk down memory lane. To stimulate the money spending center of your brain.
You love me double patties, and the triple patty's fun. Me favorite's the patty-free patty made cheap, it's just a bun. You bought the hatty patty to cover your lack of hair, You tried the briefy patty when you needed underwear!
Buy some, buy some, buy some Krabby Patties! Buy some, buy some, buy some Krabby Patties! Remember the plaidy patty? Painted up so nice! You'll like me newest patty more, it's frozen up in ice.
With frozen Krabby Patties, in your freezer aisle, You can make your own right at home pantsless all the while. Buy some, buy some frozen Krabby Patties! Buy some, buy some frozen Krabby Patties!  Buy some frozen Krabby Patties! With your money! 'Cause I want it! Right now!
Good morning, Mr. Squidward.  So, are you ready?
No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day.
That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for you.
Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it.
After you present your brotherhood gift.
Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift.
I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice.
Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right.  Wait a second... this would go great with some milk!  So, you tried to kill me over a little new aged management, eh?
25 dollars? A bomb?
That's where you left it.
You had to kill him. The boy cries you a sweater of tears and you kill him. How are you gonna live with yourself?
Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!
Eleven times as a matter of fact.
Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours.
Note to self: Watch out for Squidward.
The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.
Quit fooling around, SpongeBob, we got customers.
Plankton!
Plankton!
That Plankton is a clever beast. You've got to keep a sharp eye out for him, SpongeBob. The Krabby Patty law must be enforced. The future of the Krusty Krab depends on it.
Uh, SpongeBob?  Could you let me down?
SpongeBob! You're scaring away me money!
That's no reason to rip other people's heads off, boy! Just remember the most important rule.
No, the other most important rule. Regarding the secret formula.
As long as you do that, the secret is safe.
What is today, but yesterday's tomorrow?
Today, I want you to take inventory on everything in here; every last pickle and patty must be accounted for.
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob!
Don't get all loopy on me, boy. I need your help. And where in the high seas is Squidward?
Day...    I don't know the meaning of them horrible words!! Now quit your laying around SpongeBob, and take out that garbage! It's starting to give me a rash.
SpongeBob!
SpongeBob, I'm not paying you to stand around.  Get back to the kitchen!
Yes... why aren't you working harder?
That sound, it sounds like... the pitter-patter of...  money!  Hey, where you going, beautiful?
Stop! Please!  Wait!
How could you do this, SpongeBob? Giving me secret formula to this imposter?!
SpongeBob, no! Don't listen to him. I'm the real Mr. Krabs.
Well, if I was a robot, which I'm not, at least I'm well put together. Not some rusted-out, steam-driven piece of junk!
Take it easy with that thing, son.
Okay then.
But...
$2.99!
That's an easy one. You just...just... let's see... if its..uh.. if it's January... with...with vanilla pudding...you...uh...pass?  Wait, SpongeBob! Give me another chance.
Help! Get Away! No!
Back you Hungry Hand, back! Help!
Phew, that's okay, me lad. Long as the secret formula's safe again.  However, that penny's coming out of your paycheck.
SpongeBob! You're wasting my precious carbon dioxide!
I'm pumpin' it into the atmosphere, boy. Thanks to Global Warming the temperature will soon go through the roof. And then we'll have an endless summer.
So I can open me latest money maker, The Krusty Pool!
Eh, forget winter, boy, we're talking about sun tanning, hanging 10, and swimming all year long!
And profitable!
What the barnacles? It suddenly got a little warm in here!  Who turned up the hea...?  SpongeBob, what are you doing?
You mean pay off! Hurry, SpongeBob, fill the pool, fill the pool!
The money is ready folks! The line starts here!  Where's everybody going?
All me customers have moved to cooler climates.
SpongeBob, take these moldy sponges to the garbage, will ya?
I thought I told SpongeBob to throw these moldy sponges away?
"Money!"
What's the meaning of this, SpongeBob?!
Is he a paying customer?
Now just 'cause you swabs haven't seen a creature like this doesn't mean it's dangerous.
Aw, it looks harmless.
It reminds me of money.
Please settle down.  We've got a situation in there. I'd rather not discuss 'till me manager gets here.
Oh. It started out as a simple order: a Krabby Patty with cheese. When the customer took a bite, no cheese!
Hello. I like money.
Money.
Welcome. Welcome, everyone, to the grand opening of The Krusty Krab 2!
Now, before we begin with the ribbon-cutting, I'd like to announce the name of our new manager.
Yes. Well, anyway... The new manager is a loyal, hard-working employee.
The obvious choice for the job.
A name you all know. It starts with an S.
Please welcome our new manager...Squidward Tentacles!
Uh, SpongeBob.
Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob! You didn't get the job!
You... did not... get... the job.
SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook, but I gave the job to Squidward because being manager is a big responsibility. Well, let's face it, he's more... mature than you.
Lad, I mean this in the nicest of ways, but there's a word for what you are, and that word is... now, let's see...
No, wait, that's not right. Not a dork.
Closer, but no, no, no.
OK, that's enough! Look, what I'm trying to say is, you're just a kid. And to be a manager, you have to be a man. Otherwise they'd call it "kid-ager." You understand-ager? I mean, you understand?
SpongeBob?
Poor kid.
Now, pay attention, Squidward. As new manager, you've gotta keep a sharp eye out for paying customers.
What's this? King Neptune is riding toward the Krusty Krab at lunchtime! He's got money!
With cheese, Mr. Squidward, with cheese.
I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness. Would you like to order something?
"I stole your crown. Signed, Eugene Krabs?!"
But... But this is crazy! I didn't do it!
Heh, heh.... Don't you just hate wrong numbers?
Wait, Neptune! Please, I'm begging you! I ain't a crook! Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me!
SpongeBob, me boy, you've come just in time. Please, tell King Neptune all about me.
You see? A great boss.
Ooh! Me pants are on fire! Me underwear's on fire! I'm on fire!  Oh, yeah.
Huh?
No, wait! I'm begging you!
13, 14, 15...
Tartar...  ...sauce?
So it's a food fight he wants, eh?
Don't worry, little formula. You'll be safe in this...safe.  Fire!
Extra ketchup, extra mustard, HOLD THE MAYO!!
Unleash the condiments.
Money?  Thank you. Come again.
Quick, boy! Bar the door!
Money?!
Sounds to me like someone's just a wee bit...broke!
You could give it to me.  Just a suggestion.
Well, Plankton, like a reheated Krabby Patty, you've been foiled again!
It sure does, boy.  Why don't you scurry along?  Thanks for coming! Have a nice day!  He's been out there crying for twenty minutes.  Pathetic.  I'm just gonna go out there and gloat a little.
Plankton's broke! Ooh-ooh! Plankton's broke! Ha-ha!
Well, Plankton, me bunions are telling me it's time to stop gloatin'.  Eh? Looks like you're falling apart at the seams.  Huh?
A robot?!
Me formuler!
[the doors shut][starts to bang on the door]
Where's me formuler, Plankton?!
Why should I believe you, ya lyin' liar?!
No. Knock-Knock.
Knock-Knock.
Jimmy.
Jimmy BACK MY FORMULER, PLANKTON!!
Hehehehe... You'll see.
Refunds?!  Listen up boy!  Get in there and make me customers some Krabby Patties! All right, Plankton...  SpongeBob! What's wrong, boy?
You've got to have that formuler memorized by now!
Curse you, fine print!!
STOP!!  I'm not your enemy!  Plankton is your enemy!
He took  from you.
Not now, SpongeBob!
So, join me. Help get the formuler back, and I'll give each and every one of ya a free Krabby Patty!  Oh, no, wait! Even better: a slight discount.  To the Chum Bucket!
We'd like to have a word with you.
Enough with that niceties, Plankton! This is the last time I'm gonna ask you.
Wrong answer!
Let's hope so.
Soap in the eye, eh? Diabolical.
Wait,  didn't look painful.
Wait a minute.
So, you've been runnin' a long con on me, eh? All these years, you've been working for Plankton?!
Yeah, I guess that's a short way of saying it. STOP THAT BUBBLE!
SpongeBob!  Oh, you were like an underpaid son to me. I would have expected Squidward to stab me in the back!
But SpongeBob, me most trusted employee, working with me sworn enemy?  You know what this means, Mr. Squidward?
No! This be but a harbinger of what I fear lies ahead. For you, for me, for all of Bikini Bottom! The Krabby Patty is what ties us all together! Without it, there will be a complete breakdown of social order! A war of all against all! Dark times are ahead! Dark times indeed!
Welcome to the apocalypse, Mr. Squidward. I hope you like leather.
LET'S GO GET HIM!!
This way!
Rain down? Well that's no good! How will I get me money?!
SpongeBob, is that me formuler?  Oh, happy day.  I've missed you so much. Where was it? Where'd you find it?
It's okay, everyone. The post-apocalypse is almost over!  Ain't that right SpongeBob?  "Eugene, Eat my sub-aquatic air bubbles. Love, Plankton?"
That's okay, SpongeBob. We'll just have to sacrifice the two of you then! Prepare them for the sacrifice!
Let the sacrifice begin!
Don't cry, me boy. Everything's gonna be fine. For us.
That's right. Keep thinking happy thoughts. Now!  The boy's right.
I smell 'em, too. Ok SpongeBob, Go Get It!
Go find that Krabby Patty!
No way, Squidward.  You're going up there with us.
Yeah, this guy just wants a free lunch.
Well, I never thought I'd be eaten by a dolphin.
I have a bad feeling about this.
All hands on deck!
We need to get these guys back in the water!
Put your back into it!
What the--?
$8.99 for a Krabby Patty?! Why didn't I think of that?  You.  Cease and desist that unauthorized patty flippin'!
Book?
What story?
Me formuler!
Here. Take Squidward, you vile beasts!
Incoming!
Whatever you're gonna do, make it quick! They're closing in on us!
Ah-ah-achoo!  36 days without a customer.
Ah!
Hold on, me bucko! Food's on the way!  Uhh... You got money, right?
SpongeBob! Bring this guy some grub before he keels over!
Finest under the sea!
Huh?
No one goes to a restaurant for atmosphere. They go for food!
Money walking! I need to think up a gimmick like that to bring customers back in here!
Wait! I've got an idea!  ...And so ladies and gentlemen, be sure to buy plenty of Krabby Patties as I bury myself alive!  No free refills.
What am I going to do? If I don't think of an idea, I'll go out of business!
Why can't someone give me an idea?
Great Neptune in Heaven, I need an idea!
What in the name of money are you waiting for, boy? Tell me!
Great Barrier Reef! That patty's spoiled!
Mr. Squidward! Come look!
Don't that look appetizing?
Wait! Gimme an orange patty... with extra purple!
What's next? Sequin milkshakes?
Pretty Patties?
How can you make money with such a stupid idea?
I don't believe it!
I've got to see this for me self!
I've never had a line.
I never had 46,853 customers.
They sure are, boy. You're doing pretty well for yourself. I guess you've completely forgotten the Krusty Krab.
I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest.
Uhh... Yes. Yes, I do, lad. Well, the Krusty Krab's only a short walk away. Why don't you head on down. For old time's sake.
Don't worry, lad. I'll watch the stand for ye.
No! I've got a better idea! I'll take this old roadside stand off your hands. For keeps. An in exchange, I'll give you the Krusty Krab. With Squidward, the grill, and all those squeaky pickles!
Here's the key to the Krusty Krab. She's yours now.
Run to her, boy. She's waiting for ya.
Don't worry, boy! I'll fix it! Get this to the Krusty Krab on the double! Good luck, lad!
Ladies and gentlemen! "Pretty Patties" is now under new management! Who's next?
I'm ready! I'm ready! For me money.  Welcome to Pretty Patties! May I take your money?
Wha-!?! Who? What?
What's wrong with you?
My key! Where's my key? SpongeBob! Let me in! SpongeBob! Let me in! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob, let me in! SpongeBob!
The customer is always right.
Nickel buddy, I'll never spend you!
Or I'll feel your life with misery and woe.
...Get off me wave!
Careful!
Earrings! Well, Cashy, I guess the Devil's Galley isn't so bad. As long as that Flying Dutchman doesnt appear and stick us in Davy Jones' Locker! But that won't happen, will it Cashy?
Well, there ain't no use crying over it.
...on my Dear Aunt Sally's false teeth.
WHAT?!
How do you know?
NOOOOOOOO...!!!
Man the lifeboats!
What a no-good eel-in-a-kelp that guy was!  There ain't nothing worse than a thief!  Thieves need to be locked up forever! They should all be strung up by their gills and forced to breathe air!
What do you mean?
Oh, that's where I rent me pickles from.
Well, no.
No.
Well, I, uh...
Um... Well..
Well, uh, it's
Oh, they're...
Well, he...
That one was a gift!  Listen, all that stuff is, uh... borrowed.
Ah, permission shmermission! You can borrow anything you want, anytime, as long as if you give it back  before it's missed.  Everyone knows that! Right?
All right then!  Hugs?  You put in  a hard day's work, boys!
See you later!  Oh, that was a close one.
I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine.
Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus.
Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, my letter, is ready to go.
A pony.
With saddle bags full of money!
Here's a special something to you from me!
Okay, everybody settle down. Welcome  to the Komedy Krab!  Now please give a warm welcome to our first comic, the indiscernible Dougie Williams.
Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants.
That was fantastic, boy. You really knocked them out! I think I'll do this joke night thing again with you as the head-liner!
The headliner's the one who cleans up after the show.
Stick with the squirrel jokes, boy. Now get busy.
Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants.
It's true, I am cheap!
Can you do this?  Everyone in my family can do that.
Neptune preserve her!
It's free!
I knew it! There was no way some "airhead" was gonna win anything against a water breather!
Well, um... we're late for our...
Wait, boy!  Make it last.
All ashore, that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! Land ho!
Once you get your land legs it's not so bad!
Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!
Hip hip!
Hip hip!
Aha! Top of the mornin', boys!  Next stop: gift shop.
Uh, top of the mornin'!...?
But it's free day!
Come on SpongeBob, it's quittin' time.  I've got a card game tonight.
I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton.
Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom!  Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years!  I never lose!
I lost.
I didn't lose any money.  I lost...
I lost...
I lost...  you!
I bet your contract and I lost.
I'm afraid you don't work here anymore.
I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!
SpongeBob!
SpongeBob!  Can I have my arms back?
A patty is a patty, that's what I say.
And fries should be fries, either way.
I would trade it all away, if you'd come back to stay.
It's just a greasy spoon
Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter.  Huh?
Um...Well...  a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now.
How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands.
Now, be gone with you, you puny pest!
Glad to have you back, lad. Now get to those patties! The lunch rush is a-comin'!
That's what I thought you said.
Avast, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is...  Plankton! Stealing me booty!
Oh I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer!  Back to the Chum Bucket with you!
Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years. But you haven't got it yet, have ye bug?  Okay.  Enough lad, it wasn't that funny.  Get back to work!
Good night, me boy!
Not to mention free refreshments.
So when do we get the free food?
What did you say, punk?!
Well, these claws ain't for just attractin' mates.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Money?!  You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?
Mr. Squidward,  welcome to the night shift. From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day.
See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life.
La da dee. Stitch one per two. Doo da dee doo. Di dee dee da de...  What's that smell?  The register!  $49.0... 8?! That's a penny short!
Doesn't matter? It's money that makes the world go round, boy! It's money that keeps your pants square!  It's money that keeps Squidward in frilly soap!
It's money that paid for all them renovations we did!  Oh, nothing in all the seven seas could matter more. Not even that...  ...scrumptious curvy cutie.
Not the sandwich, boy! The curvy cutie holding the sandwich!
Mrs. Puff? Aw... she's married.
Then what happened to Mr. Puff?
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have a lass like that on me claw.
Oh, no, no, no, I, I'm, I'm too old, boy. Too hard-shelled for love. Besides, I ain't not properly dressed.
SpongeBob, no, wait! I'm too nervous! Ooohhh...
Gla-gloo!
No!
Dah me nam do um dah um!
Bo a blum, uh, do a blugh eh ou a blaugh!
No!  Gla-goo, meep bo blargh uh hee!
Rraugh glorg mic floraug!
Ca ca boom a lom!
Aye. What do you say?
I still got it.
I'm always ready when it comes to datin', lad!
Check!
Check!
Ye..., anchor? Anchor! I can't find me giant rusty anchor!
Who's that?
Oh, yeah. Well, wish me luck, lad!
Oh, I doubt that, my little shrimp boat.
Nothing's too good for you, my prickly peach.
Wonderful! Pufflily-pooh, your chariot awaits!
You'll never have to walk again, my little lobster bib!
What? $100?! Well, this can't possibly be correct!
Oh, SpongeBob! I couldn't help but spend every cent I had on her! I couldn't control myself!
I don't know, boy! I've got another date tomorrow! I'm caught in the middle of me two great loves! Sweet Mrs. Puff, and the rest of me money!
Perhaps there is, boy!  I'm puttin' you in charge of me money!
You come with me on the date and don't let me spend any money!
Now remember, we keep it cheap by going to the park. And no matter how much I ask you, you don't give me any of me money. Now, give me a dollar.
Good boy! You'll do fine!
It's me, my beautiful bell buoy!
Flowers! Flowers, boy! Go get flowers!
SpongeBob, you can't call on a classy lady like Mrs. Puff empty-handed! We ain't talking about this...  ...or this...  ...we're talking about this!
Hurry, boy! Get the flowers!
Mrs. Puff, you're as beautiful as ever.
Uh... you did. He'll be right back. He's our personal assistant for the day.
Of course, my beautiful Puff.
What's that?
We had an agreement, boy! You ain't supposed to spend any of me money!
For you, Mrs. Puff!
And here's a box of chocolates!  SpongeBob, where's the chocolates?
SpongeBob, you can't go to Mrs. Puff's house without chocolates! Hurry! Hurry!
Buy, buy, buy! Spend, spend, spend! Is that all you can think about?!
Here's those chocolates I bought for you. What are we doing today, Mrs. Puff? Dinner? Dancing? A trip to the moon?
Mrs. Puff needs a sun hat, SpongeBob!
The sun's beatin' down on poor Mrs. Puff's head!
There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!
Today! Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! I'll save you!
SpongeBob, hurry!
Good job, lad.
Didn't need to buy one?  You hear that, boy?  We didn't need to buy a hat.  Aren't you supposed saving me money!?
SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff needs a new fur coat!
You're spending all me money!  Puffy needs a new pair of shoes!
You're breaking me boy!  She needs fine jewelry!  Not that fine!  SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff...
But lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this!
Please lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her!
Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!
Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money.  Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?
Uh, OK.
Aawww...
Well, it's the worst time of the day once again.  Closing time!
Hold on there, SpongeBob!  Take that pile of filth out with you.
Huh? Ah! The Krusty Krab, she's empty!  All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?
Well, what was it? What'd he say?
Huh?  SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!
There ain't nothing fancy about that word!
Yes, that one! Now quit saying that! It's a bad word!
Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.
Not if you're a sailor!
OK, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.
What, what, what?
Yes, yes, yes?
Out with it, boy!
Yes?!
Uh... Right, now what was that part about the, um... Who now?
Now I'm gonna let go of yer lips, and when I do, I want you to calmly tell me what youse need to tell me, understand?
Do my ears deceive me?! You two should be ashamed! Time to take out the trash.  You two need to be taught a lesson. I thought I made it clear. Never, and I mean, never use number 11 or any of the 13 bad words! Now the both of youse wait right here. I'll be back.
All right, you two foul mouths. As punishment for FOULING the air in me restaurant with yer foul words, you're going to give the Krusty Krab a fresh coat of paint from top to bottom.  Ow, Ooh! Ow! My  foot! What   genius puts a  rock in a  path?! Can't you see I got a  foot here?! Oh!
...a whole lotta  and with a side of , a heapin' helpin' of  and a boatload of  ...
!
No, please, not me mommy!  Wait, please don't tell me mother! I don't think her little old heart can take it!
Oh, dear Mother! What have these foul-mouthed heathens done to you?  You two should be ashamed! Making an old lady faint with your sailor talk!
Mother!
You've got 5 minutes!
SpongeBob, who's playing Squidward's records again?
Messing with the patty's formula, that's mutiny! Why I oughta...!
SpongeBob, I got a proposition for ye. How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?
Well, keep dreaming.  This'll be on your time.
Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it  ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish.
SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers.  Oh no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!
Then go out there and get me some more jellies!
Oh, I'll keep 'em comfortable all right, inside me wallet!
I'm gonna need more than that, boy.
Oh, that'll never do. More!
More, SpongeBob!
What don't you understand about... more!
More!  More!  More!  More!  More...  More!  More, more, more, more! More, more! More!
That's it, boys! Keep that gelatinous gold mine flowing!
Uh... uh... This... This isn't what it looks like, SpongeBob! Why... uh... We're just... uh... having a little tea party!
Easy boy, what are you doing with that?
No!
Whew!
Well, you can't. The door's voice-activated and will only open if I say "open".
You'll never catch me!  Blasted exercise craze!
I'm taking jelly off the menu.
And all that free publicity will bring in customers! So don't lose!
What's that smell in the air? I smell Plankton!
Always ready, Plankton. Always ready.
That's what you think, but I got me a champion. SpongeBob! Show him!
Look at him. In his prime. You ain't got no chance!
Friend? Not in here he ain't.
He's gonna stab you in the back.
He's making a mockery of your profession. Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?
Get angry!
And win...
Medal!
Win this one for the Krusty Krab.
Don't forget, he called ye yellow.
Hey! Where ya going?
Counting me money, money sweeter than honey, money, money, this, money, money, that, profits will make me wallet fat!
What?! Profits down three dollars from last month! I got to start running a tighter ship around here!
Mr. Squidward!
What's with all this "change" nonsense?
Hmm? SpongeBob! I ain't paying you to play dress up!
Breathe on your own time. I don't pay you to breathe.
Oh, that reminds me. I got something for you.
Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning.  Here's your check.
And here's yours, SpongeBob.
There's going to be a few changes around here. Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it.
A strike?
You mean you're going to make picket signs?
And you're going to make protest speeches?
And you're going to demand me respect?
But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!
Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy.  The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone!
See what I mean? Squidward, please, you got to come back.
Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?
I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet.
Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations.
Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!
Squidward! SpongeBob!
In order to pay off these damages, you two are going to work for me forever!
I've got it! Let's all buy a Krabby Patty!
There ain't no one fool enough to take on an Alaskan Bull Worm!
In the back.
No! You'll never get a cent out of me!  Never! I'd rather that worm come in here right now and eat you all alive!  Sorry.
Go get 'em, Sandy! We have the utmost confidence in you!  Now, what was that idea of yours?
Ooh, ooh, sweet wampum. Huh! Whazzat?  Squidward, where are you? Shield me with your forehead!  So, it was a just another failed Krabby Patty theft attempt by my arch competitor, Plankton!  For a second there, I mistook you for a threat. But you're just a dirty little man.  So long, shrimp!
And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!
Clothe me if you can, silly landlubbers!
Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar!  Aw, ya got me! Well, at least it's underwire. Here's your stinkin' Patty!
Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!
Oh, but I will. Even if I have to come back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...  And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...
And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...
What's with all the ruckus?  A monster scaring away me customers!
You're a mystery, SpongeBob.  Get rid of it.
It's either you or Mystery.
SpongeBob, thanks for finally getting rid of that horse!
Now, if we could only get rid of Squidward.
SpongeBob!  What was that? Is that horse in here?
Well, keep working on it! That was terrible!
Squidward, what's going on in here?
SpongeBob, what's the meaning of all these nicknames? Davey H Jones!
So, my eyes are correct! You still have that horse even when I ordered you to get rid of it! Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!
SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend.
I was five years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together.
[sniffles] And one day at the beach, it was so hot and I was so thirsty! I spent it on a soda!  My best friend (crying)!
The point is, sometimes you have to set things free even though it's hard.  Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse.
It's ok, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat.
Get that horse!
Ah...That smells like...  ...the health inspector!  Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here!  If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.
You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son?  Just go out there and give him what he needs. Pour on the charm. Sweet talk him.
We're doomed.
Then we'll give him a smorgasbord!  The future of the Krusty Krab is at stake!
The Buttered Barnacles are a touch of heaven.
Fresh Sludge Pudding?
Some Fried Flotsam?
Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear!
Free food?!
You loony loofah, he is the impostor! We've been duped!
Bamboozled!
That's not even a word, and I agree with ya!  Look at him. I bet he never changes his underwear.
I bet his mom bought him that hat.  If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one.  You're dancin' with the crab man now! Join me, boy, or you're fired!
Ohh, hold on, I've got a ton of toenail clippings in my office!
Well, fish it out, and I'll dry it with me gym socks!  Why that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned!
Listen, he ate it!  Oh, look at him choke!  Look at him suffer!  Did you see that, boy? Oh man, the look on his face.
I don't think he'll be laughin', boy.
Because that patty killed him!
What's this "we" stuff? You fed him the tainted patty. Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!
Well, you could've talked me out of it!
Get a hold of yourself, boy. We've got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it. We've got to take it out and bury it.
This should be far enough. Now get diggin'!
What's the holdup down there?
Well toss it out and get back to diggin'!
Somethin' ain't quite right.
His head's stickin' out!
They don't need air where he's going.
Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uhh...
Listen here, ya little barnacle. No one, and I mean no one, can ever know about this. It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me, and worst of all, it'll be the end of me.
And what would be the charges?
Laugh, boy.
SpongeBob, listen carefully. We're just getting a lift back to the Krusty Krab. I need you to stay calm and don't lose your cool. Understand.
Why?  Put it in the trunk, boy! I'll keep them cops busy!
All set!
Oh, he gets carsick real easy.
Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab, I want you to take that  shovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff...err, I mean, stow it in the freezer. Understand?
...ttles of soda! Bottles of soda, Same thing, put 'em in the freezer.
Ahoy there, SpongeBob! I thought you were out back taking care of that shovel!
Okey dokey, SpongeBob!
Funny? Oh, yeah!  He's a real cutup, that one. He knows how to keep the growing stages! Good one, boy! Always on, that one, there's no off on his funny switch!  Oh, look, I almost forgot, it's 'Open Cash Register' night! First two customers get all the money in the cash register!
Here's your soda! Always a pleasure to serve the folks in blue. Well, goodbye now!
Ice? Ice? You want ice? Is that what you want? You want ice? Is that what you want?
There is no ice! There's never been any ice. Ice is just a myth.
Ok, I confess!  SpongeBob killed him!
He was insane! Out of control! He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along.
Put him down now! He's a mad dog!
Wait! It's not what you think!
We killed the health inspector! Buried him and then stuffed his body in the freezer!
It's empty?
Yeah...a joke!
Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price! Well, not really.
Disposable? Phooey.
Open for business.  See anything you like?
A buck-50 for that? But it's an antique! It belonged to a queen. Ten bucks.
It was the queen of Switzerland.
Ok, Mr. Bargain Hunter, five bucks.
Ah, the sweet smell of an all-day sucker.
I'm having an antique sale. Have a look around.
That ain't no toilet plunger! This here's an antique! It's, um... uh...  ...a 17th-century soup ladle, see?
Five bucks.
Deal.
That's right, SpongeBob, and you're one of 'em.
This hat says, "Hey, I'm number 1, and I let gravity do my drinking." This hat was made for you, boy.  You were born to wear this hat.
A perfect fit, eh son?
With 10 dollars.
Well, I guess it's no deal.
Well-- I don't know... but, okay! But only because you look so dashing in that hat.
Don't mention it, boys.  What a couple of rubes.
Yes, I am.
Fresh out.
Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-...
SpongeBob!  There he is with me million dollar hat. I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth.
SpongeBob!
Oh, never mind that. Listen, I didn't want to say this in front of Patrick, but that hat makes you look like a girl.
Oh, well, um... you're... you're beautiful.  Uh... heh-heh.  All right, now give me the hat back.
Aw, forget it! And you're not beautiful, either.
SpongeBob! Just the man I wanted to see. Still playing with that dumb old hat, eh?
Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?
Not even a little tired of that old piece of junk?
Not even a teensy-tiny bit?
Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag.
Novelty hats.  How about this air-condition one?
The juicer.
Foxy Grandpa?  So, what do you say? Your silly hat for all these hats?
I thought the Foxy Grandpa would get him for sure. I didn't want to have to do this but he leaves me no other option. I'm gonna have to scare it off of him.  This'll scare him.
I'm not a shopping list...  I'm a ghost.
Now, listen, SpongeBob.
I am the ghost of soda drink hats.  I'm here to tell you that that soda-drinking hat you possess is cursed.
Yes. It must belonged to some guy who's dead now.
Uh... Smitty something.
Uh... Smitty Werben... Jaegerman... Jensen.
Number one in Bogeyland! Now, listen, a curse will descend on you unless you return that hat to its owner immediately.
Immediately...
Yes...
Yes, yes! It must be returned to its owner, right now.
Ahh! SpongeBob! What are you doing here?
What?! There is no Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen!
How did? I just... You did... I did... Gimme that shovel.
Huh?  Ahh! Hold yourself together, Krabs. It's just a boneyard... filled with bones.  Ah!  What's that? It's Squidward. What's he doing here?  "Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams." What a baby. Where was I? Oh yeah. Gotta find Smitty Whatsajipster.  Nope. Nope. No. No. No. Uh-uh... No. Not there.  I've checked every headstone in this cemetery and there's no Smitty Wabbablabba buried here. Think, Krabs. Maybe something SpongeBob said will give you some type of clue.
No, not that!
No, no, no!
Ah!! Barnacles! I'll never find--  The grave! Am I really going to defile this grave for money? Of course I am!  Jackpot!  Ooh. It's beautiful. Come to papa.  Hey, come on, Smitty, let go!  Rest in pieces, Smitty.  I got the million dollar hat.
What? No way. Just crawl back into your hole, bone boy. Go ahead, play dead.
Yeah, right. You and what army?
Oh, no. I've seen this on the late show. You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards. Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards.
No flipping way!  Back off! Back off, I say.
Tallyho!  Look at me, I'm Errol Fin!  You're falling apart, marrow brain. You must be kidding.  Back to oblivion.  Oh, ho. How's your sister? All right, boneheads, playtime's over.  Wa-ha! A million dollars. I've got a million dollars!  Oh, there you are. Well, I got it. The rare novelty soda-drinking hat. Let's start the bidding at one million dollars.
Well, that's a spirit breaker.
C'mon, Mr. Doodles. We haven't got all day. We've got to get down to me favorite restaurant. Mine. Where we're shooting our first ever Krusty Krab commercial. After this commercial airs, we'll be swarming with customers. I can already feel myself sweatin' money.
No, I got Squidward organizing the whole thing. He's... ya know... artsy. What the...? This looks expensive. Out of my way. Coming through. Move it or lose it. Squidward!
What in Neptune's name is going on?
What you're doing is throwing away me money! I told you to rent, only, what is absolutely necessary.
Then what's all this useless junk?
Oh, well, then how do you explain that?  A 2nd Krusty Krab?
Well, you got me there. But why do we need him?
All right, get lost, all of ya. You're fired. Go on. Scram. Get out of here, you moochers. That's right, keep moving. Except you. You stay.
What are you talking about, Squidward? We got the cheapest crew in the world. You, me, and SpongeBob. Speaking of which, where is the little barnacle?
What are you doing, lad?
Quit fooling and come on out. I need you to be in the commercial.
Don't throw your buts at me, Mr. Squidward. We got a timetable to keep. This thing airs tonight.
Yup, I got a sweet deal on the prime-time slot.
That's right, Amy. I heard all about your little problem and I'm here to help. Follow... me!
Why, we're at none other than the Krusty Krab.
That's right, Krusty Krab. Home of the world famous Krabby Patty!
Why, it's only the most mouthwatering appetizing food in the seven seas.
We start with a fresh patty, grilled and juicy. Add some crisp undersea veggies and cheese. Topped off with secret sauce and some buns. Voila! A Krabby Patty.
How do you like them Krabby Patties, girls?
Two more satisfied customers. So why don't you come on in, and have yourself a Krabby Patty today.
There you are, SpongeBob.
I need you to...  ...OW!  Alright, boy. Get in there and scrub the head and stop acting so predictable.
So, if I fire him and make his successor do twice the work, and...  ...eh, come in.  Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. Those heads better be beautiful.
The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy.
What in blazes are you talking about?
Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work.
Oooooh... I've never felt such a strange combination of pity... and indigestion.
Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling.
51, 52, 53...
Perhaps, one of our more loyal workers can enlighten you on company policy.
Let's see...  ...5, 10, 25, blue, applesauce. Everything looks to be in order...except, , where is it?  Where is it?
My dime! Me special dime! The first dime I ever made! I always keep it in the back of the register for luck!
Hmmm, are you prepared to say that with your hand on top of a stack of interpretive dance quarterlies?
Me? I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test!
Heavens to Betsy, no. It's just that me lucky dime's gone missin', and you've been working the register all day!
Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities: One, you stole it. Two, you stole it? Or three, you stole it!
Show me your tentacles.
I wanna see empty suction cups.
You, you can't do that to me! I'm your boss!
Donate to the children's fund? Why? What have children ever done for me?
Wrong. That ain't me first dime.
You can't put a price on me first dime! And I can't forgive that thieving bilge rat, Squidward for stealing it!
Me first dime. Oh, "dimey", I'll never lose you again.
I've been in business a long time, boy.
Aye, lad, just let the dime and me have our privacy.
Well, Mr. Squidward, it's good to have ya back.
It's all water under the bridge now.
After all I'm sure ya didn't mean to misplace me dime.
Well, it's obvious that ya put the dime in me pants. Dimes just don't fly into peoples' pants.
Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities: One, you put the dime in me pants; Two, you put the dime in me pants; or Three, you put the dime in me pants!
Yeah, we'll see you after your lunch break, Squidward.
Oh, boo-hoo! Let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin.
I know. This really  the world's smallest violin.  See?
Scrih- Scray- Screh- Squilliam?  That guy who made millions doing what you wish you could do?
Why didn't you tell me? We'll take him to the cleaners.
Aye-aye!
Peas!  Made 'em the old-fashioned way.
That's the appetizer.
Did I say that? No, I cleaned the bathrooms on the Gourmet. I was the head chef on the S.S. Diarrhea.
Run for your lives, everyone! It's the appetizer!
How about a little music to count me money to?
Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music.
I feel completely recharged!
Come on, little buddy, play it again.  Please? One more time, for me.
Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again.
The one that goes "bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep."
Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop,  bee-boo-boo-bop,  boo-boo-bee-bop?  Not bee-boo-boo-beep?  Bop?  Beep?  Boo-boo-bop?
What is it, boy?
Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious?
Well, let's hear it, lad.
Why?
I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!
What? What is it, boy?
Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work!
What is it, SpongeBob?!
Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.
Aw, me radio died!  Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas.  Me hard-boiled egg is ready!  I can already taste it. Come to Papa.  Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt?
Ahhh! Oh, my eyes!
Ah, that's better.  Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop.
Oh, hello, boys.  What can I do for you?  Heh-heh, why did you lock the door?  Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?!  SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!
Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?!
What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs.
I'm Mr. Krabs.
I'm Mr. Krabs.
I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!
What?!  You think I'm a robot?!
That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!
You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.
No, wait! What are you going to do with me blender?! That cost me money!
No! That cost me $24.95!
No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50!  $62.67!  Four... well, actually, that one was a gift.  Nooo!
No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator.  No!
I loved it like it was me own.
Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share!
Squidward!
Huh?
What stupid barnacle told you that?
Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me.  Now, are you men ready for your Super...?
Special...?
Secret...?
Assignment?
The two of you are to paint the inside of me house!
But, let me give you two a warning. This here paint is absolutely permanent.  It will never come off. So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off...  AND MOUNTED OVER ME FIREPLACE!!!! So, have fun with the job.
What the?
You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.
Flippin' fish fossils! look what you did!
Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef!! what's this?
Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own.  That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar...  ...rama!  All the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned!
And you boys thought I wouldn't notice. Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right boys, you're free to go.  Ow!!!!! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.
SpongeBob, what are you doing?
Get down onto the floor, boy.  Alright, now you're just being silly.
Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?
And then did you draw on it with crayon?!?
All right boys, you know what I've got to do now?
There we go, good as new.
Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva!
Nah, I just like to mess with ya!  The old man's still got it!  Aww, crud, I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it.
