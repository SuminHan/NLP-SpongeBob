Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
Mr. Krabs!  Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you.
No.
You're terrible! A hydro-what?
What?
Please, please, quiet!  Is this any way to behave, hmmm?
Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register?
One single file line was all I asked!
HELP!
Oh Mr. Krabs!
But, but Mr. Krabs...
Hooray, Mr.
Hooray,
Hooray. Mr. Krabs!
What would you like to order, Patrick?
Mr. Krabs! Mr. KRABS!  Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee!
Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob, it's after closing and I'd like to go home.
Hello? Sorry, sir, we're close...
Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza.  We don't deliver.
Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?
That's not what I had in mind!
Good, then you drive.
Come on, SpongeBob. Its just around the corner.
Just do what you do in school.
Back it up.
Back... it up.
Back it up!
Shift into reverse, SpongeBob!
Back it up!!
NO! SpongeBob! You did it wrong! Gimme the wheel, SpongeBob. Give me the wheel! Give me it!
Well... you backed up. And you know what? I think were out of gas. And you know what else?  We're in the middle of nowhere!
And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?
Ow, ow ow.
...And my feet are killing me. Whoa.  SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob, this is no time for...
What is it?
He's stopping! He's stopping!
Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!
Well Who cares about the customer?!
Well, I don't!
Let go of that pizza!
Ow.  SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob! Let go of the pizza!
SpongeBob!  Hang onto the pizza!  Hey! Hey!  Wheres the road? Where's the road? We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go?  What are we gonna do now! There's no road here!
Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
That way? That way there?  So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?
Well, then I'm going this way.
Trust me, I know where I'm going.
Sponge, we gotta eat something.
Give me the pizza!
Give it to me!
You're right. It's for the customer.
Maybe we better check on it, make sure its okay.
Just a peek.
No, I think I saw something.  Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine looking pizza.
What's that? Is that the cheese?
And the pepperoni?
Oh, looks good, huh?
Give me the pizza!
Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!
SpongeBob!
SpongeBob!
Wait!
I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!
Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza!
Will you cut that out?!
That's just a stupid boulder!
SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive...  ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro!
Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge?  Sponge?
Well, this one's on the house!
He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite.
Nah. Now take me home.
Work?  Oh, my aching tentacles!
I'm getting paid overtime for this, right Mr. Krabs?
Huh?  Oh!
Are you going to order something or just make friends with the paneling?
Patrick, go be stupid somewhere else.
Fine. May I please take your order?
Huh?
Patrick, if I could make a suggestion. Why don't you just order a Krabby Patty?
Will that be for here or to go?
My cable's out.
Not bad.
This is lame.
Give me that!  Stealing my mail, eh? You're lucky I don't report you to the authorities!
They're entrepreneurs. They sell things to people.
How should I know? Things people wanna buy!  Now keep your paws off my mail.
Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.
But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restraunt?
Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!
One Pipsqueak patty  and your bib and highchair.
I don't.
I can think of three good reasons.
Krakatoa!
Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times.
Three!
Krakatoa!
Huh?! No, no, no, I'm NOT the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag... [coughs, then melts to pile of ash]
I like neither. Can I take your order?
No. What will you have?
Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?
That'll be one dollar.
Something stupid, I'm sure.
See? I told you.
A very dirty dollar?
I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs! Where we going, Fancy Springs?
Pamper Island?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Bikini Bottom Folk Village?
Clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work?  Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?
No.  And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.
How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?
Hey, watch where you're swinging that...  SpongeBob, be careful with... ow!  Okay, I've had enough.
So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Oh, please, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act.  Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar.  For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up!  Mr. Krabs...  Mr. Krabs...  Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!
That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble. This is hopeless!
We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar!  Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?
No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.
You're kidding?
A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?
Whatever. We've got plenty more to...  ...eat.
Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone COMPLETELY INSANE?!
Just look at him.
Look again.
If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.
You're crazy. If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?
Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say...  you are completely out of your mind!  Get us out of here!
Yes, why couldn't it have been you?!
Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?!
Future!
Talk to me.
A-ha!  I can't believe it's finally here!
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
That's Tentacles!
Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob.  I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt. She's a purebred.
No! Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree. See?  She even has her own papers. So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training.
For Bikini Bottom's snail race. Snellie will be winning this Sunday.
No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt.
Papers.
That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie.
Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie.
Patrick, that's a rock.
What are you standing on, anyway?  Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow.
Well SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations.
I'll alert the paramedics.
Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about.
Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!
Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!
What?!
But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then...
I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock.
Gosh, Patrick, thanks.  'The 1st Place Snail Racing Cup Presented to Squidward...  ... Will I ever win?
SpongeBob! Patrick! Do you mind?!
Closing time. The happiest time of the day!
Hooray.  Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?
Whatever.  Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty.
What?  Placemats? Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.
Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these.
SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back.  Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe.
Well, it was.
Eugene, my man.
Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you?
Here's your mail, Eugene.
Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me.
Me too, how are we going to get paid?  Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.
Uh... "dream"?
Here's the bill.
You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.
Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?
He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!
Hello?
Is it time already for you to ruin my day?
Yep, it is.
What's going on here?
Yeah...
Well, what can I say?  Its been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else.   I'm gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo.  Boo-hoo!
H-h-huh?
Woah. Huh? Wha-what?
Uh, yeah, wha-wha-whatever.
Uh oh yeah, sure.
Okay. Hmmm, yeah, sure.
Uh-huh. Y-you're welcome.
Yeah. Me, too.
Good night, SpongeBob.   Good night, SpongeBob.  Tum-ta-dum! Today's the big day, Squidward! Don't wanna be late!  Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything!  I would not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can't believe it's really happening.
Don't try to cheer me up, SpongeBob.  Please.
Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags.
Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye.  Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye.
SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving!  la, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha!  He leaving, ha ha!  SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving!
Forever?
Stop naming moves after me!
Well, it's true.
Is this where the line starts?
No! []
I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob.
You mean this morning?
Ahh, finally, the weekend is here. And this isn't just any old weekend.  This is the weekend that SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back?
Ho-ho, that would be great!  You've waited a long time for this! A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no...   What the...?  SpongeBob! Aren't you two supposed to be camping?
SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house.
No.
What do you mean, "have fun inside"?
Oh. Bye.  You little sneak! I see what you're doing!
Don't think I can't see what you're doing!
You're saying I can't take it!
Aah. You're saying I'm soft! You think your little "have fun inside" challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is never gonna happen! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So, get used to it!
That's it! I'm in! I'll show you camping!
Now you'll see how a real... ugh!  ...outdoorsman does it!  Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn.
It isn't put up yet, you idiots!
Huh? Voila!  But what could compare to just lying out under the stars?  Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?
Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows, but I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls , just as soon as I can get my can opener.
Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house.
All right, all right, gimme a marshmallow.
Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?
No! This is relaxing.
BETTER?! I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!
A sea bear? You mean like the ones that...  DON'T EXIST?!
There's no such thing! They're just a myth.
"I Married a Sea Bear"?
"Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real"? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!
You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?
Okay. Then what?
You're kidding.
Go on.
Sliced or cubed?
Yeah, yeah, and?
Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off!
And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger.
I don't know...  Just a feeling!
Yes.
You guys are so gullible. See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened. If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up?
Oh, pfft. Sorry, how silly of me! You mean like this?
No.
Are you crazy? A dirt circle won't stop that monster. I'm running for my life!
Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then.
Well, I guess I'll just have...
What'd I do that time?
Okay.
Move over!  Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life!
What attracts them?
Huh?
Uh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.
Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.
SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world?
SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.
Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...
Oh, sure, sure.  A genius? Well, how about... Hey!
Hoorah.
What's all the yelling about?
Fascinating.
Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?
Let me guess. It's at home, under your mattress.
Another day, another migraine. Heh, heh, mi...
...graine. Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah, great.
Yeah.
Yes...
How's it going, Lieutenant?
Whatever. Huh?  SpongeBob, don't you know who that is?
That's the Tattletale Strangler.
The Tattletale Strangler!  He's promised to strangle anyone who turns him in.
Huh?
Ghosts!
What? That is totally unfair!
Zip it!
Mr. Krabs, can I go home yet?
Look at these bags under my eyes; even my bags have bags!
Mr. Krabs, he is not normal.
43...!
Is number 5's order ready yet, SpongeBob?
Oh, brother.  Number 5. Number 5!
SpongeBob.
What the? Ohh!
SpongeBob! SpongeBob, open up!
Why don't you go ask him yourself?
He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
Yeah... now please leave me alone.
Wow, this time I'm really late again. Maybe he'll finally fire me.  Locked?
SpongeBob?
You mean I got out of bed for nothing?
Harsh.
Why do anything? I like the new Mr. Krabs. He yells at you more.
So am I.
What? You want me to spend my hard earned money on my richer than me skin flint boss? No, thank you.
What are you morons doing?
Oh, I see. You're just kissing up to the boss to make me look bad. Well, I won't stand for it. Gimme that card.  Trying to outsmart me, will ya?  There, I signed it for all of us.
So I suggested we get you a new one.
Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I took care of that personally, too. I had it hauled away to the dump.
What? Haven't you ever heard of a bank?
It was SpongeBob's fault. Getting Mr. Krabs a new mattress was his idea.
Ooh... you did this, SquarePants! If you don't get Mr. Krabs' mattress back from the dump, I am going to murd...  ...help you do it myself.
What? Where? Lemme see. Where?
Oh, that figures.
Okay, here's the plan: you two quietly go in there, remove the mattress out from the guard worm without... waking... the worm.
And nothing's meaner than a junkyard worm. He'll eat you alive!
Oh, I've got the most important job. I'm going to keep watch to make sure it's safe.
My pleasure. Now let's gets a move on.
What are you morons doing?
What did you idiots do?
I didn't do it! You blockheads woke... the... worm.
Retriever to worm bait, stay in. Don't go out.
No! In! Out.
Oh, look, you're at the far side of the dump, right?
Good. Then make lots of noise to draw the guard worm away from the mattress so I can retrieve it.
And my perfect plan falls into place.
Coast is clear. Squiddy, you are a genius.  Ouch. What the...? Hey, I needed a wooden spoon. I'll just keep it safe from harm in my back pocket.  And now for the mattress.  I should've guessed.
Alright, you two, what's the holdup?
Come on, do it for old man Krabs.
Sure, but first, put on this cologne.
Okay, so you are dressed as choice cuts. You go in there and yell "Trick or treat!" The worm will realize he forgot to stock up on Halloween candy, he'll leave to buy some then we take the mattress.
Now get in there!
I am not going to get hurt this time.  Isn't that Mr. Krabs?
Oh, I give up.
Yes.
Nope. Can I go now? One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying?
What are those Neanderthals up to? Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself?
Mr. Krabs, some guy in a suit wants to come in before we open.
He's got a card.  R.A. Penny Pincher: Vending Supplies.
What is it?
No, thanks, I'll pass.
Okay, if you insist.  Thanks.
All right, all right.  Oh, boy, what fun.
Did you see that, SpongeBob? I almost got that on my first try!
They don't call me  for nothing.
Haha, good luck. You'll
Hmph, beginner's luck. Now it's the master's turn.
Well, thank you for saying so.
Ha! If you think you're winning that thing again
Oh, I loosened that one up for you. You would've never won that without my skill.
Hmph. I bet I win at this thing the very next time I try. Now all I have to do is
Ha! I'm not falling for that malarkey.
Oh, what the Alright. Let's get this over with.
Gee, thanks.
No.
Because... I'm... all... out... of...
Very funny, Mr. Krabs. If I can't win one of those stupid things with this quarter, I'm walking away.
Huh?
A little mind-numbing television ought to help me forget about that stupid machine.  Yeeowwww!  You've had a rough day, Squiddie. But that doesn't mean tomorrow won't be better.  Oooh, phooey!!  I gotta win that crane!  Just once! Please, oh, please, let me win one time!
The deed to my house.
If I can just win once, I'd never play again!
SpongeBob, there's a secret?
Tell me...  the... secret.
Yes.
Yeah!
Yes!
Yeah!
SpongeBob! The secret?!
Close your eyes?
Oh, that's ludi...
This is ridiculous. If I close my eyes, how will I know where the...
Yes! Yes, I do!
But this is my last quarter.
Okay, okay.
Whoo-hoo! Yeah! I knew I could do it!  I'm a winner!
I am a winner, aren't I?  Winner, winner, winner!  Wiiiiiinner!  I'm a winner, everybody! You hear that?!  I'm... a winner.
Yuck it up all you want, Mr. Krabs. But just remember, you're yucking  in the presence of a winner!  Ha!
Make way for the winner!
You didn't win the prize?
You know what that means?
It means... you have no skills and you're a loser!  I'm a winner, see my prize! You're a loser who sits and cries!  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Did you see how I handled that crane?
I think I had the magic touch.
I just closed my eyes and became the crane.
SpongeBob, look.
Be the crane.
Be the crane.
Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the
Oh, uhh, be the crane. Be the crane.  Look out, SpongeBob. I can't stop!  Be the crane. Be the crane. Be the crane. Okay, don't be the crane! Don't be the crane!
Oh, my. Ohhh, my. Uhh... Time to go, Teddy.
Uh-oh!
SpongeBob...
SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?
Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you.
You did overlook one teensy little detail, however.
It's Sunday!  A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!
Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday!  My Sunday relaxation kit.  Let's seepillow.  Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance.  Ah, and the final touch.  Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4 my good man.  This is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot.  Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder. Take me on a chocolate vacation.
What are you two idiots doing?!
Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses.
Better?
The what? Is this some stupid club you two made up?
Fine! As my first presidential decree, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer?  Now out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays.
Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore.
Oh, no! It's already noon! I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday!
What's going on out there?
My eyes!
No really, I'm fine. Please, Ino, uhh
At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to.  What are you two doing in my house?
French tips, huh?  Alright, pal, make with the foot massage, pronto.
Alright, you two! Out!  And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day. Or tomorrow or next week.
Yes, it does!
Yes, I was! You call yourselves good neighbors?! You're the worst neighbors ever!  You don't deserve to wear those fezzes!
No, you aren't! You're horrible neighbors!  And stop calling me president!
There are only 3 hours of my Sunday left. They took it all away. I didn't even get to read the Sunday paper.
Good neighbors my right!  Hello? "Keep Out Intruders For Good! New Security System 5000. Free Installation"
That oughta do it! Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now!
What the?!
"Sorry for bugging you so much"? What the? Security system, help! Intruder alert! Intruder alert! What's the matter with you?!
GRRR, you infernal contraption! I'm gonna ship you off to the scrap heap you came from!
What's going on?
Run for your lives!  What the? What are you doing?!  I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. Ooh, just what I've been waiting for.  I am gonna relax if it kills me.
This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot.
No-no, don't say anything more. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now if you'll be so kind to leave so I can get ready for work tomorrow.
Shush.
Get out of my house! Huh?
Yes! Yes, I am.
Huh?
Fantastic.
Please don't do that again.
Heaven knows I won't.
Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome to Krabby O' Mondays.
Can I start you off with...
Happy, happy birthday.  Happy, happy bir...
Sincere service with a smile.
Sincere service  with a smile!
Ahoy, Eugene! Would you mind clearing this table for me?
They're watching us.
Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again.
I really think you should look.
Oh, hey Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene about article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook.
Really, Mr. Krabs?
What do you want, SpongeBob?
More like another nickel.
It's not that funny.
Move over.
Here's your food.  It's not that funny!  Please make it stop!
He's gone laughing tormentor.  This could be my chance.  SpongeBob, you don't look well!
No. You should sit down.
Shh, shh, shh.  You're burning up, SpongeBob.
Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?
And your temperature is 175 degrees!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing.
SpongeBob, you've got to be careful! You're gonna burn out your laugh box.
Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter. If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again.
Yes. What? No! Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious. If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again.
Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing. Any laugh at all could be dangerous.
Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day. But you better go 24 hours just to be safe.
Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack.
I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy.
I think I found the one thing I hate more than his laugh. I'm sure he'll cry himself out soon.  What have I done?  Oh, that's it! This charade has to end.
SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop.
SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box! I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!
Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes.
Yeah.  You really fell for it.
You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine.
It's hilarious!
Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel. I will yahhhh!
Where am I?
Cut it out?
Gimme that. I can never laugh again?
But, you cut out my laugh box.
SpongeBob?
Uh, no thanks. Who wants to be the 'makeup department'?
Artist?
Well then let's make those old crabapples sizzle.  Hmmm...  Time for the art-eest to go to work.  Voila!
As they'll ever be.
Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?
Are you planning on ordering today, sir?
How original.
Daring today, aren't we?  One Krabby Patty, extra onions.
Whatever.  Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns!
Thanks, Farmer Brown.  It's been a thrill serving you.
We're all out.
No.  Let me guess, Tiny, a small salad?
We serve  here, sir.
I need a Krabby Patty.
Huh?
Patties are done.
Hooray.
Whoop-de-doo.
Oh, boy.
Alright, alright. Time for another hideous day at work. Ahh, just hang in there, gorgeous.  Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow.
I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob.
Well, here we go again.
I'm not sure what it is but I something seems different about me.
Hey, what are you doing with my hand? What am I doing with your hand? Ahh! What is this? We're all mixed up together.  This is horrible. I have my clarinet recital tomorrow.
Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated.
Well, you have to do something. I can't stay stuck to him.
Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea. Let's try it.
It's no use, Sandy. We're still the same.
Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this.
Misery.  SpongeBob, hasn't anyone taught you how to ride a bike?
Ow, ow, ow. SpongeBob! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
If you say so.
Do you have to be such an accommodating buffoon?
I don't have time for this. I've got to man the cash register.  Whew. Can I help you?
SpongeBob, I need two Krabby Patties.
That's how we got into this predicament in the first place, you imbecile. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like a moment of peace.
Sandy! Sandy! Please tell me you've figured out a way to separate us.
Hello Molecular Separator Ray. Well, let's get on with it. My clarinet recital is tomorrow night.
What'd you say?
What? Day after tomorrow?! No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No! I have a performance tomorrow! I can't be stuck to that yellow freak.  Sandy, please, you've got to do it before the show.
Of course.  Oh, my.  Where are you, Sandy? Sandy? I can't do it. I can't go out there.
Superstar?
You're right. The show must go on.
They... they... they're cheering. Superstardom. This must be what it feels like. This is what it looks like. What it [starts to laugh happily] sounds like. And...  ...what it smells like. Oh, simply intoxicating.
Hmph.
Huh, no wait. Wait!  Oh, my one moment of fame... gone.  There's got to be some way to reverse this.
It all started when I was born.
SpongeBob?
SpongeBob?
SpongeBob, look!
Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish.  See?
Where are all the new hotel employees?
Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro.
This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service.
Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?
Gimme that! Now sign the register.
Patrick, all you have to do is write your name.
Close enough. Here's your room key.
How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel!
SpongeBob!
Take Patrick and his bags to his room.
And bring him a Krabby Patty.
Oh, Mr Krabs!
Fine. Let's go, Patrick.
What's in these bags, rocks?  Hey, these  rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?
Well, here's your room.
Enjoy your stay.
What now?!
It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?
Happy?
Why don't you ask SpongeBob?
What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?
Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!
But Mr. Krabs...
A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!
That's it! I've had enough!
Not anymore. I quit.
One room, please. On the top floor.
I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where "we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request".
I've got cash.
Spongebob, carry my things to my room.
And you can carry me to my room.
The plaque.  Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee.
And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hairs.
And I want it here in 5 seconds.
Oh,  not gonna eat this. You are.
Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make.
These don't taste like anything mom used to make!
How should I know?! Ask my mother!
I'm impressed! These  just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook.
Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice.
"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request".  Perfect!
Nothing like getting back to the basics.
Oh, before you leave, I wanna go swimming.
Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim!  Come on in, the water's fine.
Nope, that's it.
No, I'm good.
You're not gonna have a heart attack are you?
Oh, boy.
Go away!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ee! Ow! Ee! Ooh!
SpongeBob, how many times do I have to tell you: I don't believe in ghosts; and I never liked you!
Huh?
What's going on?
Mother?
Uh, Squiddums loves his mama.
Ghosts?
There's no such thing as ghosts. No such thing.
SpongeBob?
No! No! That's impossible!  Ghosts! Ghosts!
The banner's up, Mr. Krabs.
I'm sure she'll love it, Mr. Krabs.
I finished Pearl's portrait, Mr. Krabs. It's a true masterpiece.
Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty.
Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money.
Oh yeah, I know all their songs.
Here she comes, Mr. Krabs.
It is dishwater.
Hello, ladies.  When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!
I'm here! The King of Clarinets has arrived!
Hmph, No one's ordered the monster patty in ages. SpongeBob, one monster patty.
Uhh, one monster Krabby Patty.
Oh, boy.
Nice outfit, SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob.
Can it make me famous?
SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.
One monster Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob, why aren't those patties ready?
I'm not rushing perfection. I'm rushing you.
Oh, this job stinks! But at least I'm not digging ditches.
Don't you have to be dead to have a memorial anything?
No, I don't, and neither does Mr Krabs.
To be far away from you as possible. C'mon, SpongeBob, this hole's not gonna dig itself. And I'm certainly not gonna do it.
Hey!
I'm not cryin'!  Ow. Ow.
That was the worst song I ever heard. But at least this stupid well's finished.
All I can smell is that dumpster.
As long as there's no singing.
Having fun down there, SpongeBob?
Patrick's down there, too? It just gets better and better.
I got my wish. You two are stuck in a dark hole and away from me.
There's no magic, SpongeBob. Wishing well's are just a scam to fool saps like you.
Let me out of here.
I gotta get out of here.
There's not way to climb out of here.
Well, why don't I just start right now? After all, I got a couple of dumbbells right here.
Could you not stand so close? You're making me claustrophobic.
No, it doesn't.
It's not working, Patrick.
Oh, sorry, SpongeBob.
Eww. Patrick!
Stop pushing me, Patrick.
No, like this!
Patrick, get off of me!  I told you I am claustrophobic!
Patrick!
Free. I'm free!
The only thing I wish for is to be far away from here.  Ow.
This is idiotic.
You got it, Mr. Krabs.
What a sun-tastic day!  Snail trail.  That SpongeBob needs to keep his pet out of my yard. I am sick of cleaning up after him.
Not my pet rock collection.  That's it! This isn't the first time you've soiled my yard with your revolting excretions. But mark this down in your little notebook: it will be the last time!  This cheap, splintering wood will keep even Gary out. Now, I feel safe.  SpongeBob!
Hey, SpongeBob...  Keep your shell vermin off of my property! The next time, my annoyingly yellow neighbor, your wet pet oozes on my lawn, you leave me no choice but to call Snail Control. That little monster...  He bit me!
Oh, but it's just like you, SpongeBob, to raise such a misbehaved mutt.
I'll say. I hope he had his shots.
All of his shots?
For rabies?
Snail pox and soft shell dance?
Bronchitis, lumpy-bump trump, teen angst?
Rash?
Well, now that you mention it, my throat is a little dry.
Well, after I was bitten by a mad snail, I began to get a rash; followed by loss of balance, ticklish rib cage, and a few other symptoms.
I'm a zombie, here to dine on your squishy yellow flesh.  It's locked!  Somebody let me in.
Oh, yes I am.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
I thought you were on vacation.
Nor will I.
Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.
SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.
I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.
Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.
One shell on a shingle.
Who? What? Where? What? How?
Nope.
Oh yeah, how could I have missed it?
Umm...maybe.
I can't wait.
Mr. Krabs!  I've served a lot of junk here, but a hair patty?
Hide your shame, SpongeBob. Hide your shame.
It's about as functional as your brain.
That wasn't a compliment! The entire town is laughing at you!
Just look at yourself.
SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before.
That wig is infested with parasites.
Can't you see how ridiculous you look?
SpongeBob, turn that noise off!  This'll get his attention.
Sponge...
It's called a reeeee! [When he says the last part, a note plays.]
Great.  my reed...  is still...  stuck in my...  throat.  And it's all your fault.
I didn't. It was SpongeBob who...
A submarine?
Why don't you just shrink the reed?
Are you sure this is safe?
Wonderful. Wait! If you're out here, then who's in here?
SpongeBob and Patrick are piloting a miniature submarine inside my head. SpongeBob and Patrick... SpongeBob and...
I heard that!
So, how's it going?  I can't control my eyeballs!
Okay, now what is this?
Oh, of course. I've got  head shots, you know.  What the...
What's happening?
Oh. Ya think?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not in control of my actions.
Stop burping inside me! That's disgusting!
What?
What?
Morons.
Get out of my body! Go!
Good morning, Mr. Krabs.
He-  And who are you, my rubenesque beauty?
Well, she sure is stunning.
Hi, Patricia. I drew this for you.  Likeness is uncanny, if I do say so myself.
Eh? Ya know, Patricia, they don't call me the 'Sizzle Lips Squid' for nothing.  So, are you free this Saturday night?
SpongeBob?!
Are you sure about Saturday night?
But I made reservations for two at...
Umm, I think I need to take a shower.
It's too quiet. Something isn't right around here.  Could it be? SpongeBob is gone for the evening.  Here's to a delightful evening alone with you, public television.
Will you two be quiet?! I'm trying to watch public television.
If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that.  What?
You're still there, aren't you?
Not so fast. You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening.
Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone?  SpongeBob? Patrick? Oh, what's the point?
That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen. Once again I'm going to have to leave my own home just to get some peace and quiet. Enjoy my TV.
I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. Pfah! They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement.  Oh.  Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob.  Jellyfish Fields.
Um... hi.
Brine soda, low-fast seaweed crisps, cool jazz.  Mm, mm, Squidward you have done it. You have officially spoiled yourself rotten.
Magic? Can you make yourself disappear, SpongeBob?
This can't possibly end soon.
I don't care where I'm going, just take me away from here.
Ew.  What are you doing, SpongeBob?
Hey, stop!  Get me out of here!
Hello, sunshine.  What a beautiful morning. Just perfect.
My-my-my house. What's happened to my...huh?  SpongeBob, Patrick.[explodes] What the barnacles is going on here?! Look at what you've done. Look at my poor front yard.
Ferris Wheel?
No, it's not great! It's horrible. Oh, that's it. Stop! People of Bikini Bottom, stop! Stop! Patrick's no king. Look at him. How can this pink blob be king?
You. Do you honestly believe that that mindless starfish can possibly be the king of anything?  King of Morons, maybe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, see? Uh-huh. See?
See? See? You're not a king. And now, they all think so,  too!
What?
Give me that! A treaty, huh? Well, here's what I think of your treaty!
That's no pet, that's a wild animal.
I wouldn't let that thing into my house even if it was potty-trained!  I didn't need to see that.
How can you possibly have fun with a jellyfish?  SpongeBob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish... FOR TWELVE HOURS!
Grr! Eighteen hours!  I'm going to give that SpongeBob a piece of my mind!
SpongeBob, listen to me, you square-headed assault on my ears, I've had enough of this!  Strawberry.  Two can play at this!
The jellyfish don't like...? Why sure, pal, I can play better.
Uhh, w-wait, I can turn it down.  Everybody's a critic. You won't be hearing from me anymore.
Yes, SpongeBob?
Oh, my. This sounds serious. Luckily, I know just what you should do. Listen closely.
Get a good grip on your pants.  Turn around.
That's it.
Does that part include laughing at you? Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual.
No, I don't.
No.
No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, outfits, or your fellowships.
Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?
SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. One of your many annoying traits.
You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way.  What was that?
What?  Gimme that.  Don't just stand there, save us.
Panic! Run for your lives!  The Wild Ones are coming!
Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket.  I want to ride to live and live to ride.  I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live.
Woo-hoo-hoo!  Ride to live and live to ride!
Would you like a drink with that order?
That comes out to two dollars even.
Mr. Krabs, we haven't sold a single soda in days.
That's telling them.
I love waking up to my own circadian rhythm without the aid of an alarm clock.
No, and leave me alone!
Ah, the blank canvas. Infinite possibilities. All of the colors of the known and unknown universe hiding on my palate. The artist approaches, ready to create.
Perhaps I can find solitude in the printed word.
Okay, SpongeBob, you hide first.  Oh, no, where'd he go? I guess he wins.  Defeat has never tasted so sweet.  Yello?
How 'bout a game of hang up?  Well, I guess this brings an end to my luxuriating.
It's called, "I will never play with you... ever!"  "That scoundrel!"
I think that moron finally gets it! I don't want to see or hear him for the...  SpongeBob! Will you make that racket stop?! SpongeBob, you open this door right this...
What are you doing, SpongeBob?
What manner of annoying scheme is this?
Hi. Now, SpongeBob, what the...?
Hello, Squidward.
SpongeBob, what is the meaning of this?
So, you'll be filling in for me when SpongeBob wants to play one of his stupid games?
Oh, Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Woo-hoo-hoo!
Alright now, who has the Krabby Patty and who has the Krabby Patty?  See... 'cause... they're both... krabby.
Oh, sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
Fine then. Do my work for me.
I'm starting to like this Mini Squid doing my work, keeping SpongeBob off my back. I could get used to this.
What the...? That's my joke!
What? All right, all right! That's enough! My break is finished.
Oh boy! Back to work!
Oh, Mr. Krabs.
What's the big deal? Those are all my moves!
That Mini Squid.
That was awful!
He stole my jokes. He stole my job. He stole my standing ovation! You little wooden friend. Stop stealing my life!
Wait a minute. I've seen you before. You're that music agent that represents my favorite clarinet player.
You mean you're here to sign me up for a record deal?
A sequin suit?! That's what you're supposed to offer me! Why take a cheep knock off when you can have the original.
Now, where do I sign?
My dreams are crushed. But, hey, at least I won't see that Mini Squid ever again!
The concert is ruined. My reed is shot.  See? I'm finished.
But my reed!
But...
Not bad.
And, I hate to admit it, but I suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust.
Hey!
How long do we have to keep this up?
What the...? Just let it go, Squidward. Let it go. Don't get involved, Squidward.  Of course.
Get on with it, SpongeBob.
Don't you find this a tad suspicious?
Yeah. I really wanna know.
You already ordered.
Hurry up, SpongeBob!
What is taking you so long?
You're not being paid to love.
Look!!!
Good ol' Jim! When you worked here, the place had class.
No.
Now I feel complete!
SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?
Well, hurry up. I gotta cry, too.
Because when Jim leaves, I'll be stuck with you again!
Really?  Yes! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee, hee, Ha! Ha!
No, thanks. I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off.
Yeah! Ha! I could lose my beautiful, flowing hair, too, but I'm not buying a wig yet.
My hair! My beautiful hair! My hair! My hair!
Burning!
What are you two whimpering about?
It's me, Squidward, you idiots!
Listen, you guys. I don't care or want to know what you do in your spare time. But could you turn off all these lights?
Oh, SpongeBob, there are no creepy creatures of the dark. It's all in your imagination.
Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
Get away from me!
Just keep walking, Squiddy, don't make eye contact.  Ah, now to soothe my frayed nerves.  Alright, what's going on? Why are you two crying?
There. Now see?  It's supposed to do that.
Good. Now will you two be quiet?
Move to another neighborhood.
SpongeBob!  SpongeBob!
SpongeBob? Why are you all puffy?
Your skin, SpongeBob! What's wrong with your skin?
That's no blemish!
Oh, I'll help you, alright!
Here's your change, sir.
What was that? No, no Mr. Squidward! That can't be the Ick.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
If SpongeBob were here, we'd be covered in the Ick!  Lunch is served!  Eat up, kids.
Oh, why am I so itchy?  Oh no.  SpongeBob gave me the Ick! And I gave it to all you people!!!  Stay back, you diseased freaks!
No! No I didn't! It was SpongeBob! He's infected the entire Krusty Krab!!!
It's not me, Mr. Krabs!
Hello.
Goodbye.
No, Mr. Krabs, it's that time of the month.
I'm on it!
I hate my job.
I'm not...  ...wearing a disguise.
Ripping good day for a spot of driving.
Hey, use your mirrors, fool!
Ah! Can't see! D'oh!  Ow.
I have an important life to live, and it doesn't include chattering with you two ninnies.
A tropical getaway? On the triple decker Conhugo cruise liner? SunbathingParcheesiballroom dancing! This is going to be so easy. SpongeBob doesn't realize that I'm the face of The Krusty Krab. While he's isolated in the kitchen all day, Ill be out here, building a rapport with the customers.  Hello. May I get you anything else, Miss--
How does SpongeBob know all these names?
Hey, SpongeBob, could you take a look in the cash register? I think it's broken.
I think you might need a closer look. Let me give you a hand.
Keep looking, SpongeBob. keep on looking.  So, what's your name?
Good-bye, SpongeBob.  That should buy me enough time to win that cruise.
How in Neptune's creation do you know all these names, SpongeBob?
Thanks, SpongeBob!  Let's see. Halbert, Norma, Isabelle, Gus, Chas, Pelar, Jess, Cara, Ivy, Harv, Mable, Mavis--  And your name isSuzie Fish, correct?
Mr. Krabs! That's the last customer. Do I win?
Uh, that's, that's--
Out of the way, loser.  Um, hello. My name is Squidward.  Uh, so, what's your name?
Uh, it's just that I was going toenter your name in our sweepstakes!  So, what should I put down?
Sure.
I see he wants to play hard to get. So be it! I have ways of making the likes of him talk.  Uh, sir, you forgot your soda.
It's on the house.
Oh, I'm sorry, I slipped. Here, let me get that off of you.  Okay, there must be a name tag or some form of I.D. in here.
Hey, look up in the sky! A giant meteor is hurtling towards Earth.
Oh, you'll see it, Just keep looking.
Well, that's too bad, because I found what I was looking for.
Finally, the moment of truth! Say good-bye to anonymity, Mr.--
No, you don't understand. I only want the wallet for--
This isn't as it seems!
His driver's license!  At last! At last! And your name is--  Mr. What Zit Tooya? What kind of ridiculous name is that?
But, but, but, I-I-I didn't intentionally do anything wrong.
Only 364 more days and 9 years left until I exchange this concrete tomb for a multi-story ocean liner cruise.
SpongeBob?
Call me what you may, fact of the matter is I found out the mystery customer's name first. So I win.  I win, I win, I win, I win, I win, I win!
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Tropical vacation, here I come!
What? In the brochure, it specifically gives away an ocean liner vacation.
You mean, no vacation?
Oh, well. At least I'll have some peace and quiet for the next ten years.
One Krabby Patty and Krabby Fries for table number four.
Spill at table...
If you love it so much, why don't you just live here? [chuckling]
Jammed again.
SpongeBob? What are you doing here?
In the dishwasher?
SpongeBob living at the Krusty Krab? Wait a minute, if he's living here, that means he won't be living next to me. Oh.
Just saying goodnight to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs. Sweet dreams, SpongeBob. You look much more comfier in here than in your old home next to me!.
No. Coming Eugene.  Good night's sleep, here I come.  And when I went home at night, guess what?
Right! And when I woke up in the morning...
He still wasn't there.
Here you go.
Socks and--  What the...? SpongeBob, why is your underwear in the cash register?
What?
Ah! Eww.  Well, he may be twice as annoying at work, but it still beats having him as a neighbor.
The same person who knitted these napkin holders and embroidered the menu.
What the...? SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
Oh, it's freezing in here.
I'm so glad I don't eat "here"  Oh, how cold does Krabs keep this place, anyway?  62? Oh, that cheapskate! I'm going to start it to a toasty 63.  Huh?
Oh, thanks a--
"Do not touch thermostat ever."
That's totally selfish!
I'm going to go recover from hypothermia.
I might need to bring a sweater. It's colder than yesterday.
Huh?
What?
As long as you turn the heat up.
There's icicles hanging from the ceiling!
Order up.
I'm really glad I don't eat here.
Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe.
What the--? SpongeBob, what atrocity is this?
Pizzazz, huh? What would you know about ?
You buffoons wouldn't know artistic vision if it hit you over the head. Now, where's the paintbrush?  I'll show you what artistic vision is all about. Start with light brush strokes.
Yeah. Perfect.  Simpletons.
A log cabin?
Everyone's a critic.
Oh. good-bye, paintbrush. hello, antique fitting.
That, I sculpted out the concrete foundation of The Chum Bucket.
Those were all fabricated from The Chum Bucket walls.
Oh, that's Plankton's wife.
SpongeBob, I need that order of six.
Uh yeah.
SpongeBob, where is that other oh, there it is.
Right here, muscleboy.
SpongeBob, hand over the Krabby
What are you going to do with it, take it home? Put a little dress on her? Go out for a romantic walk with it?
I wonder if it's too late to get a refund from my therapist.
How should I know? Do I look like my idiot's keeper?
As if on cue.
How could you possibly date anyone? I mean, look at you. She must be blind.
What's that putrid odor?
Well, you should know considering the fact you work here, sod for brains. Speaking of sods why don't you get rid of this garbage? It's starting to stink up the joint.
I'll show you sick.
Beautiful, huh? How beautiful do you think this is?
Well, I definitely see I can't the mentally atrophied. Good-bye, Creature.
That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!
That's it, Mr. Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now.
I can't take the world's greatest fry cook anymore! I'll see you in a week.
What are you two morons doing?
At 3:47 in the morning?
In my bedroom?
You sneak into my house every morning?
Do you remember what I told you happens to my brain every time I see you?
And that is why I will never, for as long as I live, and throughout all time and eternity, ever--
And with every fiber of my being, I know that I never want to see you two again--
--for as long as time shall stand.
What?
Get out!  Perfect.
Oh, of course. Come, have a seat. The picnic's about to start.
It worked! Now I just turn on the electric fence.  Now, they'll never get back in.
Huh? What? No! Get out!
No! You're going out this door, right now--
Do they have cute sea horses there?
And the little scallops that nibble on your fingers when you feed them?
Can I come?
Good night, Bikini Bottom. I love you!
Good morning, SpongeBob.  Hoooonk!
You were right, SpongeBob. Watching the sunrise together is much better.
Hello, SpongeBob.
I wanted to help you work.
How are we today? Everything a-okay here?
How's your meal? Anyone need tartar sauce? I have an idea. How about a free Krusty Krab Junior crew hat for the little tyke.
Who wants a free refill?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Krabs told me to help you, so I made Krabby Patties.
Wow, SpongeBob! You've been Employee of the Month a gazillion times. I wish I could be employee of the month.
Yes, sir.
Enjoying the party, SpongeBob?  How's the cake, SpongeBob?
I love being Employee of the Month.
SpongeBob! Patrick! What are you two still doing here?
What's that music?
Oh, great.
Uh, no thanks, I got to go.
That'll be five dollars.
I'm worried he just left with my paycheck.
Hey!
A miracle, a marvel. It'll cook Krabby Patties at a fabulous pace.
I'll let you try one. Shove this in your face.
Ah, but this gizmo is faster, and you won't pay it a dime.
Hmm, just fire SpongeBob and tell him, "Get lost."
Not bad!
A really good try. But let's see how you do against my machine set on high.
Ha, ha.
I got one last chance, I'll turn up the heat.
Let me know if I've won!
Well, Squidward, ol' boy, all that's left is to go win that dancing trophy and give it a home. After all, nobody ever worked harder to get it than you.  All those years of training with the masters. Your tireless effort to keep your instrument supple.  Not to mention your weekly thigh waxing.  And now, it's time to go get it. So, let's do it. Whoo...!
What? What are you two doing?
Ha. The two of you? Don't make me laugh. Come here... see that? That's where the trophy's going.
no, you twits. I built that trophy case for me when I win. I'm going to ace the tryouts today and then I'm going to the finals tomorrow and win the trophy. I am going forth to meet my destiny. Good-bye.
Oh, great. The flying Gyvonne Brothers. Just ignore them, Squidward.
Do I know you?
Poor boobs, they don't stand a chance.
You actually got in?
Humph, if those two nitwits made it then I'm a shoo-in.
Look out, dancing world, here comes your future. Music, please.
Excuse me?
But, but, but, but, you don't understand. I already build a trophy case with the cutest little plaque. If I could just touch it...
But I, hey... Unhand me, you brutes. Ah!
Doh, help me up.
The audition? My trophy?  I mean, uh, uh, yeah, the audition.  Evidently, I'm such a great dancer that I've been banned from the competition for life.
What? I've got better thinks to do than help you two dopes.
Fine. But I keep the trophy when we win, deal?
Ok. Show me what you got, Patrick.
Well, I guess that just leaves you, SpongeBob. Show me your stuff. Ready, and...  Having fun?
SpongeBob, dancing isn't supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be art and art is suffering! Now, we'll start with some ballet. Watch my feet and follow my lead. Ready, and...pli.  Relev.  And now grand jet.  Where am I? See if I can find the lights.  Wait a minute.  This gives me an idea.  Ready, SpongeBob?
A one and a two, and...  Pli, jet, relev -  No, no, no. This will never work. You've got two left feet.
Gimme those.  That's better. Ok, let's go. SpongeBob, what are you doing?  Why are you moving your arms like that?
Argh, hand 'em over.  And the other one, come on.  Ah, now that's more like it.
Are you questioning my leadership.
Ok, hand it over.
What's that?
Oh, please. Just wait until you see my brilliant moves.
Quit groveling. Where is your dignity?  These losers are here to worship us. I mean me. By the end of the night I'll have them on their knees just begging for more.
Will you stop it? And let my dancing do the talking.
Of course they have. They are in the presence of a true artiste.
Ha. If they think that's good, wait till they see...  Cramp! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Must finish dance... on other...
I'm in pain!
Mine!  I won, I won!
Wait, SpongeBob, no!
Okay, would you like any fries with that?
And two orders of
But you said "two."
SpongeBob, order up.  Welcome to The Krusty  SpongeBob, what in Neptune's...  SpongeBob?  Well, his spatula's still warm.  Well, SpongeBob. I must admit this is strange behavior, even for you.
I think he's in some kind of self-induced trance.
That's what's causing all this? Only a complete moron would worry about what some critic has to say.  I rest my case.  Hey, in or out, mister. You're lettering out the A.C.  Weirdo.
Well, do you want to order something or do you just want to block my reading light?
Mr. Krabs, the only thing my life depends on is going home at 6:00.
She is so tacky.
No.
Well, the first reason is, I have no use of my arms. see?
Looks like some horrific shroud.
You really need to see a doctor.
What's in them?
Oh, clever.
But that's SpongeBob's job!
Okay, how am I going to do this now? Umm  Mommy, is that you?
Mr. Krabs? Uh, this is a bad time, isn't it?
Well, there are some men out back with a delivery and want you to sign.
Got it.  Ow.
What the heck is this stuff?
Mr. Krabs, don't you think you might be taking all this a little bit too far?
Now what?
Spongy Patties?
Where'd you get them?
You mean to tell me you actually expect people to pay $1.98 for a rotten patty?
Now, what's going on?  What is that horrible smell?  Is Patrick thinking again?
Patrick, it smells like something crawled in your brain and died.
No, I'm not.
Just ignore them, Squidward, and continue your power walk. Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.
I don't know about you, but I'm going on my coffee break. A very long coffee break.
And I thought this friendship would never pay off.
He took off his pants.
I'll give him eleven minutes.
SpongeBob, do us all a favor.
Ok, that's enough.
Can we please stop this?
It went in my mouth! Choking on sentiment! I think I'm poisoned!
Oh yeah, you really touched his life.
Quality food?
Good people?
Discriminating tastes?
D'oh!  Only pathetic losers with horrible taste would eat this garbage!
Fancy? Froufrou?
It was that easy? All these years?  I've underestimated the power of public transportation!
Does your middle name happen to be "No SpongeBob within a thousand kilometers of here"?
But the surly attitude he has is a step in the right direction!
Oh! What  that?!
Mr. Krabs, tell these guys to let go of me!
You sold me?!?
You're pathetic!
Couldn't you at least give them tables to eat on?
Neptune's ascension. The only surviving painting from the great lost city of Atlantis. This is just what the doctor ordered, Squiddy. Spending your day studying the Atlantean masters. And best of all, no Sponge...  Oh, would you two watch were you're  What is that? What are you doing with the amulet of Atlantis?
You're going to steal it!?
This is a new low, even for YOU TWO. Lucky for you, I was here today. Stealing artifacts could land you in the stony loneso...  ahh! ahh! ahh! ome! You boobs found the missing half to the Atlantean amulet?
Amulet, bot omelet! It's the key to untold riches!
Yes Eugene. The streets are lined with gold, and the street lamps are made with diamonds.
For reasons unknown, this great city disappeared one day, but no ruins were ever found. All the inventions that you take for granted, were given to us by the Atlanteans. Their advances in art, financial wealth and weaponry were eons ahead of their time!
That's just the oldest living bubble
That's just a painting you quarter-wit!  Quarter-wit. Ha, it's less than half. The real bubble lives in Atlantis, some darn old bubble hales in comparison to the art...
These two chowder brains found the missing half to the amulet of Atlantis.
The magical path to Atlantis is a Van?
Fabulous decor!
Ah, what I wouldn't give for a foot-rub.
Does that make any sense?
As a connoisseur of fine art, I'm proud to say! I've always seen things in my own special way! 'Art'-lantis with their glorious aesthetics, I'll cop their style in a while- my art will be prophetic!
Hey look, it's Atlantis.
You villains haven't even been here two minutes and you've already messed up someone's topiary garden.
You're standing on my neck!
Okay, I've seen enough. Let me out of this thing!  What's going on here? I... Oh no.
Help!
Somehow I knew I'd get stuck with you yahoo's the longest.
This stuff is wonderful and all but when are we going to see some real Atlantean culture?
I thought you'd never ask! Art is the conscious arrangement of elements in a manner that affects a sense of beauty.
Incredible!  The creativity! The artistry!  This painting is so realistic! It looks like you could step straight into it.
This place is amazing!  Isn't this great, isn't this neat, I'm a living work of art from my head to my feet! From the very first drawings on walls in caves, art has been what the heart and soul craves! So pick up a brush, a pencil or pen. If you don't like this one, paint it again! From now on please call me Sir Real. I can wait for your impression to congeal. Take it from an undersea renaissance man. I'd even look great on the side of your van! Any way you carve it, I am art and art is me. Ask your mama or your dada to tell you about the uh, schism. Between minimalism and cubism. My personality may be of the cynical type. But I've finally found something that lives up to the hype. I can say honestly and with great certainty, that Atlantis is where I want to spend, eternity
Look's like I'll be here inspiring these Atlantean art makers with my beauty. You guys go on ahead!
I'm never leaving this place. I've learned more about painting in a few hours here than I did in four years of community college.
What is wrong with you two morons?
Why would you want to leave a paradise like Atlantis?
But Atlantis was a fabulous, artistic paradise!
And back to my depressing life of quiet desperation.
Please turn this bus around!
Stop saying that!
SpongeBob, I'm...
Not really.
It was me, I said it.
The Krusty Krab welcomes...  the Tarpon twins' birthday party. Here are your Krabby Kids Meals.
Great?  Those little savages tried to kill me.
You two are harder to get rid of than cockroaches!
Grr! Grr! Agrr!! Grrr!  Why aren't these things working?!  Out of the Daydream
You're better off not knowing.
It's not my birthday!  That's it! I'm moving out of this neighborhood!
Oh that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.
Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say "neighbors?"
Neighbors. Uhh...
SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite...
Drum? What drum?  This is just my wig case! See?  Come on SpongeBob, tackle me!
Oh, I get it. You don't know what day it is, do you?
Why, it's Opposite Day!  You mean you've never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!
Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?
Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?
Yeah! Why don't you get a jump on it.
So long, chum.  And goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob!  I'm almost sorry I'm leaving!  Opposite Day.  SpongeBob, what are you...
I'll tell you what's terrible! Living next to you! You're the worst neighbor in history!
If the real estate agent sees that mess, I'll never sell this house!
Out of the way, SpongeBob!
Oh, Opposite Day. Next time, it's going to be "Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!"
Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet.  NO!
Stop! Get away from her! Oh oh, I am so sorry, Ma'am, I hope these two barnacle heads! haven't harmed you in any way.
Why, I'm Squidward!
Ma'am, please! What about my house?!
Wait!
No, no, no, no, no!
Please, sell my house!
Don't leave me here!
Let me show you guys how much I... hate you!
Happy Opposite Day!
Am I getting paid extra for this conversation?
Well, since you can't bring any customers into the Krusty Krab, have you ever thought about bringing the Krusty Krab to the customers?
La la la la la la la la la la la la.
Now all we have to do is keep SpongeBob away from the...
Did you get any of Patrick's "gold"?
Ah, stay away! Oh, another SpongeBob nightmare.
Don't you ever wake me up from my beauty sleep! Do you understand? Idiot Boy.
If I knew, do you think I'd be standing here getting yelled at by a bunch of morons?
I think we just went through this...
If I knew that was the last time I've seen SpongeBob--  I would have slammed the door in his face even harder!
So, you're saying this thing can actually find SpongeBob?
Oops, I dropped it.
I wouldn't seek out that twit for all the leotards of the sea.
Ha! Is that your version of a threat?
Mr. Krabs, I am not interested in any-  Is that a handcrafted jewel-encrusted ornamental egg? That'll complete my collection! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Krabs!
Don't just stand there, get in.
Hurry up!  Decorative egg, here I come.
Whoo-hoo-hoo, SpongeBob's leaving for real this time!
Mr. Krabs, I brought back your number one fry cook you gotta pay up.
Ohh It's BEAU-TI-FUL!  STOOOOOP!
He's leaving, again!
Welcome to the Krusty Krab. Where it's almost as if the evolutionary clock ticks backwards.
excuse me for just a second.
Do you mind, I'm trying to work in a fast food restaurant. You might wanna try it sometime!
Remind me to fire my therapist.  And stop bringing your neighbors to work!
I don't care!  $4.19, please.
Alright! I am gonna... Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do, but...
SpongeBob, you nincompoop! You broke my face! Don't just stand there, help me! I need a doctor!
SpongeBob?
How does it look?
Come on. Spit it out. I cant take it.
What did she call me?
Quick hand me that mirror. What the...? Wait a second. That nurse was right. I am handsome!
Well SpongeBob, earlier today my spine was hurting, now I'm resting on fine leather upholstery.
Oh, don't worry.
Huh? Well, better go greet the commoners.
Good morning my people! I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but even I  strange as it seems, need my beauty sleep.
I guessed I kept them waiting a little too long. I know, a little music should soothe their hunger.
Beautiful and talented. what more do they want? Don't worry folks, there's more where that came from...Hey!
There's nothing a little foaming herbal bath can't cure.  Hey my grandmother gave me that soap! Well no one ever said it'd be easy being so handsome Squiddy. You'll just start getting used to..
SpongeBob! You gotta help me! They stole my bubble bath! Public life ain't all it's cracked up to be. I want my old life back.
We don't have much time! Take the door and change me back.
Come on, SpongeBob. Take the door and smash my face back!
You better hurt me or I'm really gonna hurt you!
Now don't hold back, SpongeBob. Just really let me have it.
Uhh... okay, just let me just memori...  Dooowww! Hey, I wasn't ready.  Would you mind waiting till I...
Spo... hang on a sec  ... let me... uhhhh...
Well, SpongeBob, it was you who got me into this mess, now you have to get me out again!
Got me into...
Huh?
SpongeBob?
I almost wish that meant something
I knew I shouldn't have gotten out of bed today.
Okay. But first let me call the mortician and tell him his uniform's been stolen.  Clothing zinger!
You called Ms. Gristlepuss a disgusting old prune and you threatened her with a french-fry strainer.
How long has he been standing over there?
So, would you like to secret-size that for two dollars more?
Did you just call me "Squidwart"?
There's two of them?!
Step on it!
Oh.  Hello. Hello.  Hellooo!
This isn't Squilliam Fancyson, my life long rival who I met in high school band class, is it?
I was, until you called.
Wait, why did you ask me if I was watching House Fancy?
Who's that talking in the background?
Hey, that's no better than my house!
It's simply glorious!
Hello, my name is Squidward Tentacles, and my house is far fancier than that slob Squilliam's!
Really!
Two hours? But I haven't even got time to wash my hair.  There's a stain on the rug! I'll just use this chair to hide it. There we go. Now I'll just...  There's a hideous hole in the wall! I'll just use this painting to cover it up. Perfect.  Oh no!  I'll never get this place in shape in time!  SpongeBob! How long have you been spying on me?
It's the day you go away, and never come back.
How'd you know about that?
Do you want me to get the cops down here again? Because...  All right, fine. But one slip up, and you are out of here. Comprendo?
All right, first of all I'm going to give you something so simple, that a person without a brain could even get it done right.
Really?
I don't care! Just use this paint to cover up that faded spot on the wall right there. Don't touch anything else!
SpongeBob, what was that noise?  Skin me alive and drench me in boiling oil! What have you done to my living room? I told you just to paint the faded spot.
Never mind! Maybe it won't show up on camera. Here, help me move this sofa.
Hang on, I'm trying to get the grip on the thing. Now don't move it until I say...  Ow! Okay, it's on my foot. Now don't...  Ow!
Ow! SpongeBob, I told you not to move it until I say...  Ow! Why do you keep moving it?
I don't need you, I can move it myself.
Oh no, they're already here! Go get a vacuum and clean up all the sofa bits. I've gotta run upstairs and dress my wound!
Okay, SpongeBob, I finished... What the?
Come out of there.  Uh, hang on please.  Please, just one more minute Nick!
Oh no!
I have-... I have?
Why, yes. I've studied him for... years!
Yay!
Give me a break. You don't know anything about music! Too bad you're not a musical genius, like me.
What the
Well, I could help you, but I wouldn't soil my art playing Rock-N-Roll; dressing all in black, wearing boots covered in spikes  playing enormous stadiums filled with screaming, adoring fans  clapping, demanding encores, cheering me  Oh, uh, changed my mind. I'll join your band and help you bottom feeders  BUT I gotta get in shape first!
Hello?
Are you kidding? I've got a lot of work to do before I'm famous!
My perfect dream-body.
We're gonna be stars!
I'm ready!
Don't talk to me.
That counts as talking.
Me too.
Never.
Does a movie like that even exist?
A flip book?
Good evening,  and  welcome to the  Krusty Krab semi-annual charity night.
Let me show you to your table.
Uh-uh... Yes, sir?
That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me!  This is the moment I've...  I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money.
And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights.
Going on what?
What talent could you possibly possess?
No one, not even your parents, would want to see that.  What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.
I can hardly wait.  Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes.  Tennis shoes. I crack myself up.
Alright people, listen up. Gather around everyone, chop, chop.  Now, you may be thinking this is your one shot at the big time. Well, it's not. It's mine.
No one is going to watch you engorge yourself.
So you really want to be in the show?
Ok, you get to mop up afterwards.  Now will you stop bugging me?
Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home.  Thank you. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well.  Put your fins together for...  Put your...  Put...  Pearl.
And now, poetry.  By Gary.
Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me!
Yes.
Now, now, don't you worry, Mr Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward!
You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!
Yeah, show's over!
They want an encore!  Stand aside, SpongeBob!
They've all taken their grand-guppies to see the guts and gore across the street.
You call this fun? This is just cheap uncultured lay sport.
This is fabulous!
SpongeBob, will you keep it down? I am trying to hone my musical talent here.
And you guys!  Do you really think that bill board is more important than my musical genius?
Bikini Bottom Symphony Orchestra?
Original compositions wanted? Me, a famous composer?  Thank you!  That would be nice.
Whoo-hooo! Yeah! Yeah!
Okay.  Get it together, Squidward. Put your game face on.  Heh, that's better.  Take your time with this one, Squidward, old boy.  Due tomorrow?!  Only one day to write my masterpiece!
No!  Get out!  Patrick, what're you doing here?
No, thank you.  I am a solitary artist.
I'm a genius!
Can't you two be quiet for one day? My composition is due tomorrow.
Become famous, revenge later. Hmm.  Come on! Be inspired!  Yes, brilliant!
Noooo!!!  Why? Why? Oh, why? (sobbing  Dowrgghgh!  I did it!  Hahahahahaha! Yes!  I did it! I did it! I did it! And I did it! Ha ha ha ha!
Here you go, maestro, my masterpiece.
I wrote down everything I heard?
Patrick, get off of me!
Ooh... What the  ...now?
STOP!  What could you possibly be trying to do this time?
By running around and screaming like a banshee?
There are two kinds of people. There are people that are normal.  And then there's you.
Yes, really! Maybe you should start being a little more NORMAL!  Doh...
Well, how about you start by...  GETTING AWAY FROM ME, YOU LITTLE CREATURE!
Oh, great. SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty.  What, no annoying blurbs today?  Hmm strangely quiet.  SpongeBob?
What's the meaning of this?
Normal, huh?
Oh, really?
Whatever. I know you're just waiting to say something stupid.
Uh, yes... it is.
Yeah, I'll uh...see you.
I wonder what got into SpongeBob... And what the heck is that?!  Whose house is this?
Hi, SpongeBob.
Good, just coming by to get a drink.
It sure is.
Yeah...  See ya.  Oh, my.  I could get used to this.
There you are, sir.  Oh, yes it's time again. I've been meaning to say this but I've come to appreciate your demeanor lately.
I never thought I'd hear myself say this but please come in, SpongeBob.
Well, today is dusting day. The day I dust my 483 self-portraits.
You know, SpongeBob, it's OK to be a little different.
What the...?
And stay out of my home!
It's me, Squidward. I'm looking for SpongeBob.  Hi, how are ya?
Wonderful weather we're having, hm?
Yeah, whoo.
37... 38...
Looks like I'm crushing your face.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't move too much, it ruins it.
I hear you! I hear you!
SpongeBob?
Can I ask you something?
What's that?
You know.
This.
This thing here.
The spatula
Oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense. You're a half-wit who injured himself at work being a nitwit.
Injury. Your brain is injured!  Wait a minute. Did you say that you got that splinter injury
Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. That's  good.
Yeah, when Mr. Krabs finds out, oh, man.
Finds out about this injury.
He'll be forced to send you home.
Here, let me take this for you.
It was a good shift while it lasted.
I know it's hard to say goodbye.
Oh, I believe you, SpongeBob, but, unfortunately,  the rules clearly state that you must be sent home.
Sorry, the rules are the rules.  Yeah, it'll be pretty quiet around here with Mr. Krabs sending you home early and all. I just hope we'll make it through the whole rest of this day without you here.
What? Me? Tell Mr. Krabs? Oh,  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No.
Well, maybe.
I don't have to tell Mr. Krabs.  Because he already knows.
Oh, yeah. Mr. Krabs has preturnatural instincts when it comes to situations like this. It's almost as if when something's amiss in his restaurant...  ...he can smell it.
You mean I can get paid while I'm at home?
Ow!
Can I get my "compersation" now?
Huh? What's that? Hmm, must be hearing things.
Ahhhh... smell that fresh morning sea!  La da dum dum dee.
Huh? Must be hearing things... Again!
What is that noise?!
Ahhhh.... I should have guessed. It's too early for this.
Alright you two!  What is the meaning of this?!
Don't you mean, "Playing the slide whistle?"
Hey! Get out of here! Huh?
Alright you two morons! Show yourselves!
I don't need zest! I need you out of my lampshade!
Get out of there!!!
Grrrrr...  Just get out of there!!!  Okay, that's enough! You've had your fun.
Not the windows again!  Gotcha! They're gone. Whew! Now if they'd just stay out of my house, I might be able to enjoy a little squid time.
I gotta get out of here!!!
Go away!!! Can't you idiots take a hint?!
I think I lost 'em.
How would you like it if someone did THIS to you?!
Don't you... I do?
Well, uh...ha... that is true...
Well... If you insist...
Okay!!!
Watch this!
Goo goo wa wa goo goo wa goo goo he ha wa...  ha ha ha!
If you say so.
Would you like some more?!
Let's give them a grand finale they'll never forget!
>Now you're in the driver's seat Squiddy! Squidward does the slide whistle noises and isn't paying attention to the road at all.
I've never felt so alive!  I don't wanna stop!
What are you talking about nitwit?!
What up ahead?!
What is it now Sponge...  Ghost? I'm sorry I was so mean to you while you were alive, please don't haunt me.
Oh this is too precious! You're sun bleached! Looks like you won't be at the party.  Sun Bleached!
Squidward, my man, you are perfect!  Oh no, my kelp garden is all wilted! Don't worry fellas, I've got just the thing to perk you up, kelp grow. Hold still.
Patrick?
What are you two doing here?
STOP EATING MY KELP!!!
Oh, do you like to eat ice cream, Patrick?
Then have some more!  Still want that ice cream?
Are you done yet?
Hey!
Oh no, I only paid for it. I wouldn't want to deprive you of it.
Give me that!
Fine! Why don't you two use it for your good deeds?
What did you do?
Hey, get back here,  and fix my nose!
Aha, they went this way.
Oh, tell me about it.
SpongeBob!  Hey! Look at what you did to me. You better fix my nose, or you'll hear from my lawyer!
Yes, I'm sure!
No wait, don't.
I look horrible!
Well, pardon my anatomy!  What's happening?
What did you do to me?
I don't want to be a giant lumbering monster!  What will I do now?
SpongeBob, get back here!
What the?
OH, QUIET YOU MORONS!!!!!!!!!
Ow!
Okay, okay, I'm nice.  Now will you leave me alone?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
What?
Uhh, I'm a lamp post?
Well Squidward, I guess this is your new life.  And this is your new bed.  Good night, old life.  I'll miss you.
Where are you?
What the? Get out of there!  You two have ruined my life!
What the?
A giant clarinet?  And it sounds divine!  Now I'm too small to play my giant clarinet!  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever played!  Well, at least I still have my kelp garden.  What?  You cut it down?
Down there, sir!
He got away, sir.
How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton? It hurts, doesn't it? I know!
I thought I told that kid not to put the organic sea cucumber on top of the free range anemones! Well at least my flowers survived the trip.  SpongeBob, would you please find your own flowers to sniff!
What are you taking about, nitwit? He doesn't even have a nose!
My floors! Think fast, squiddy. I've got your nose.
Yeah I've got it...  ...right here.
If you want it, you gotta go get it.
Let's see Patrick destroy these.
What's wrong with the pin head?
Where do you think you're going?
What are you doing with my cheese?
That was my cheese. It's supposed to smell like that, kelp for brains!
Let's give him what for.
Who cares? At least now that pink moron will leave us alone!
And one, and...
If I cared, I'd ask what this is about.
A case like this?
That's right! I was in a tap contest on the night in question. As you can see from my third place medallion.
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!
SpongeBob, I've been sitting here motionless for 45 minutes. What could you possibly have heard me doing?
SpongeBob, I will give you $5 if you let me enjoy the rest of my morning, in peace.
Hey, I could have sworn I had $5 in here.
I don't care, what Mr. Krabs said! I just want.
It's hot choclolate.
It's locked!
Huh? The key! Oh, where did I put that stupid...
Oh, why can't I just find?
What?!
Yes?
Oh,  that was a recumbent bicycle, and I sold it.
So I could get further away from you!
Bon voyage, nincompoop!  What the?  Can I help you, officer?
Ticket? Officer, please! I have inpeckable boat smarts! I pried my self in obtaining an un-soiled driving record! It's all that I have!
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo?  Boating school.  Oh well, it's just one day out of your life Squiddy. How bad can it be?
Um, excuse me, there don't seem to be any empty seats left.
Do you mind?
won't be doing anything, because there is no we! Understand?
Me?
Why I'm.  All right, i'll tell you. I was trying to get away, from him! He is the bane, of my existence!
Gladly.  It all started when I left my house. And then, he appeared. He made, an immediate right turn, and parked, here.  Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways, and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed, at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was then forced to par-take in  evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?
His side?
Shut it.
I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school.
Mm, bon appetite, Squidy.  You've ruined my morning, you've ruined my lunch, and you're ruining my...
Eh, didn't see that coming.
SpongeBob, look out!  SpongeBob, give me that wheel!
Just let go of it!
I was just leaving.
How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever! Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!
Thank you.
SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help.
SpongeBob, please? This is important.
No no, I didn't. I never said that.  I don't need your help, and I don't need you!  Jerk!  All right, I said it. But that was before.
Before before.
Before we were,  boating buddies.
Time can't be up. I didn't even get a chance to fill in a single answer. What am I supposed to do?
Next week?
Yep, what another wonderful hum-drum day slinging burgers.
Yeah, I'm just breaking it in.
: We haven't sold any papers today.
Hello.
If it gets any hotter in here, we're gonna have to put fried calamari on the menu.
The fan stopped working.
Probably out enjoying this beautiful day where it was meant to be enjoyed.
They're at the beach.
I told you!
Who are you?
What next?
You idiot!
SpongeBob, what are you doing with that seaweed?
Island?
Great.
Again?!
I bet this guy won't even be here. If he's anything like that last group of dirty drop-outs.
You've never even seen him!
You're right.
Oh, my j-
Look, surf-boy, are you gonna teach us how to surf, or are we just gonna stand here and stare at you all day?
What? You call that a lesson? We just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours!
I don't know about you two, but I'd like to get out of here at some point, and if his idea of teaching us is...
Oh, wonderful.
That's it?! I just wanna go home!
Oh, thank you. Thank you, SpongeBob.  Well, did you talk to him?
And?
We're gonna be stuck here forever!!
Oh, oh. Please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night.
All right, I'm done! Hey, blondey! Teach me how to surf so I can go home, or I'm gonna...
Here it comes!!
I volunteer SpongeBob.
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Look! That's Mr. Krabs down there!
I guess the Big One prefers a high-protein meal.
Look!
Fi-ga-ro. Figaro!  Fi-ga-ro!  Fi-ga-ro!
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro!
Fi-ga-ro!
La la la la la la la!
I am anxious to make a strong first impression, and share to my singing skills with the famed Bikini Bottom Mens Chorus.La-LALALAAA. But I needn't be too anxious, for once they hear this masters voice, they'll give me the Lead Solo for sure!Fi-ga-ro!
Huh?
Well, looks like a forlorn SpongeBob sprawled out in the dirt.
Obviously depressed...
Oh, what a lovely day! For me!
Huh?
Well, I have no time for the likes of you.
None of your business!
And No You Can't
No
No
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Does that answer your questions?
No You Can't!  If you must know..... I will be a feature solo for an impending concert performance with the Bikini Bottom's Men's choir. And in the big time... Not playtime. Now if you excuse me.
au revoir, SpongeBob
See you in nose-bleed seats!.
La La La La La La La, La La La La La La La, La La.
Huh?!
Yuck!
Fi-Ga-Ro  Fi-Ga-Ro!
Fi-Ga-!  I think I hit the wrong note back there  What the...?!
If that rank amateur SpongeBob embarrasses me in front of the Bikini Bottom Choir Men, my life is ruined!
Oh! I'm almost late for Choir Practice! Better not run into SpongeBob again or I'm doomed!
Haaahaha! Figaro! FigaroFigaroFiga-roooo!
Your song? What are you, some kind of...
A singing traffic ...
SpongeBob, I will be late to practice with all of your tomfoolery slowing me down!  It is a high honor to be chosen for the Bikini Bottom men's chorus, and you are not going to keep me from performing my Grand Solo!
Figaro! Figaro, Figaro, Fi-ga-ro!
Just in time!
Gentlemen.
LAAAAAAAA!!
SpongeBob?
Ha!
That he found while cleaning out his attic over the weekend.
You're the only one talking.
Barnacle butt.
Ay! What do you want?
Oh really?
Sure! I'll teach ya. Listen closely now. The Vikings were....
a race of scholars and scientists who lived before even Mr. Krabs was born.
They are believed to have discovered ketchup....
and enjoyed dressing up their pets as....
scrambled masonry on the weekends.
Their favorite movies are in black and white.
And grown Vikings are known to collect socks which they display and trade at monthly sock trading conventions called Sock'n Garten.
Of course they do! How else Mr. Krabs come up with such a brilliant idea?
SpongeBob! Can't you see I am trying to work?
But what?!
Well, then why don't you go ASK THEM?!
Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?
SpongeBob, there's some Vikings here to see you.
What the?! Hey! You can't do  thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-!!
Would you mind telling us what this is all about?
So, let me guess. Your name must be....
Ha.
Well, if you must know, I'm a widely renowned clarinet virtuoso, state-recognized interior design consultant, licensed and board certified antique macrame conosuor, born and raised collector and sculptor of driftwood, and able to recognize over 13 hundred brand names of single-personed pedal operate vehicles at a single glance. Plus, I make a killer Souffl.
Hold it right there, whiskers! Let's not forget you're the one who dragged me onto this crate in the first place. Now, you ask me to pour my heart out, and this is the respect I get? Well, you got another thing coming, honey! I want off this boat, pronto.  On second thought, bathroom attendants make me some tips. Well, look on the bright side, Squidward. No more living next door to SpongeBob. Let her rip, Jack-o!
What the barnacles is going on down there?
It's all yours.
You owe me big time, Mr. Krabs.
Hm? Oh! I couldn't be better!
Roger! Is that you?
Hello, Brother Roger.
Thank you.
Ah. This almost makes the other three hundred and fifty-three days worth living for.
I'll never forget my initiation ceremony.
SpongeBob! Patrick! Did you follow me here?
But...but, I..I...I....
I can't believe it. They kicked me out of the Cephalopod Lodge.
Were you dropped on your head when you were a baby?
Psychic powers. Hey! Where's Patrick?
The last thing in my life I really enjoyed. And SpongeBob ruined it, too.
Yeah.  I do, don't I?
No!
You can look now.
SpongeBob! Are they letting me back in the lodge?!
Oh. Now that you two have ruined the last good thing in my life,...I think I'll go slam my head in the door. Repeatedly.
No. Why didn't you just make up your own dumb club instead of ruining mine?
Aaahhhh! .
Say good-bye.
Morons.
SpongeBob! That's not a secret hand-shake! Everybody knows Patty-cake!
Out!
Oh, what now? I'm coming! What do you... Great. Must be one of SpongeBob's pranks.
Are you insane? You kidnapped me?
What? What kind of initiation?
Oh, boy. Look at the time! Gotta run.
Eee-aahhhhhhh!
What's this? Can it be? My lodge robes! I'm back in the lodge! I gotta try 'em on!  Huh? This can't be right! These aren't my cephalopod robes!
Feather Friends?
Grrrr.  I don't want to be a Feather Buddy!
Grrr...no.
A sock?
One flaw?
Huh.
This is ridiculous, No one is dumb enough to believe SpongeBob and Patrick are a..a....giant albino eel!
Unbelievable.
Do not worry. I will save you. Be gone, foul beast, or, I will smite thee.
Whoa!
Aaah! No!
May I help you?
Nope. .
If you say so.
No.
SpongeBob, thank you so much for that lovely invitation but I must respectfully tell you I will never visit you.  Ever!  Take heart, Squidward, it'll all be over soon. .
That's probably because I've never visited you.
Before you ask me that question, ask yourself this: Why would I leave the comfort of  home for your dirty ?
A stick of butter, and just a touch of pepper...  Dyaah!  Not on the rug!  SpongeBob! Will you keep it down? I am trying to cook!
Well, you made me spill pepper all over my imported rug!
SpongeBob!  I need the right tool for the job. Huh?
Why do you have my vacuum cleaner?
That's because I've never called you! Now, why have you stolen my vacuum cleaner?
Are you done cleaning up that dingy hole you call home?
Yeah, probably not.  I'll be over to get my vacuum in twenty minutes.
I just want my vacuum back...  You've made an exact replica of my living room!
No! It isn't! You can't just steal my decorating style, and...  Never mind. Just give me my vacuum.
No.
No.
No.
I-I don't even know that that is!  Please just give me my vacuum so I can get back home. I have a casserole in the oven!
This is not a visit. You are going to get my vacuum.  And stop fluffing this pillow!
Imbecile.
How did he do it?  He got my coffee table, my vase, snack table, coasters, and my Art of the Clarinet Coffee Table Book.  And this pillow looks just like the one Mommy made for me. He even copied her stitch signature! "For Squiddy, with love, Mama."
Never mind. I'll find the vacuum myself!
My hallway...  Dear Neptune!  He even got the chip in the paint from when I moved in!  Okay, Squiddy. Don't get creeped out. Just get the vacuum cleaner and go home.  Oh, right. Isn't this neat? My bathroom.  I have to give him credit, though.Every detail is correct.  How does he know the exact contents of my medicine cabinet?  My rash cream??  That little sneak!
SpongeBob, you idiot!
Oh, what a horrible nightmare.
Guh... will you excuse me for a moment? I need to use the bathroom again.
I gotta find that vacuum and get out of here!
He copied all 492 of my self-portraits...  ...and they're better than mine!  He even got the rug right. Get a hold of yourself, Squiddy, old bean. This doesn't mean anything.  This...all of this is just...  Mimicry! He doesn't possess your style, or your decorating acumen, or your love of the finer things. In fact, the only thing that he has is... is... my vacuum cleaner! And I'll remedy that...  posthaste!  A-ha! He put you in here along with all his bad tastes! You're coming home...  Home... with me... with me...
SpongeBob!  Is it really you?  It is you!  Come on, baby. We are gonna walk out of this horror show the way we walked into it: with dignity and pride.  My house...
What happened to my house?
Why, yes, I'd love another spot of tea, Mr. Vacuum Cleaner.  Care for some casserole??
Ah... Replica, sweet replica.
Oh, no. It's that little yellow freak.
Just ignore him. Maybe he'll go away.
Do I know you?
Never seen you before in my life.
Is that supposed to be you?  I can't believe. He actually left.
Being too darn happy all the time!
Moron.
Whatever.
Oh, I'd love to.
But...no! Don't...
Fine. Take a Krabby Patty and put it on the grill.
Why? I don't think it's going anywhere.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Um... fine.
Here's the slop you ordered.  Enjoy. If you can choke it down.
No.
Taught him everything he knows.
What is?
Alright, I've had enough!  Bunch of nonsense!
Huh?
No, I am not, nor would I ever want to be! I am quite content being Squidward Q. Tentacles.
Why?
My very own music class? Did you say "Squilliam Fancyson"?
I'm... Squilliam Fancyson.
It is... No, I mean, uh, no, no, I didn't!
Oh.
Who? Ha, um, uh, and a good evening to you as well.
Good evening, students. Now, our first...
As I was saying, our first...
Yes?
My-my name? What for?
Why don't  come write  name on the board? We'll see how  like it.
There, now how does  feel, Billy?
Good. Now, why don't you take your seat and stop poking your nose into other people's business?!  Now, if we can go for five minutes without having any further interruptions. I would like to...
Squilliam, everybody, he was about to say "Squilliam"!
Didn't you two nincompoops know? I have my name legally changed to Squilliam Fancyson. And you are to refer to me only as Professor Squilliam from now until the end of time. Now blink twice so I know you understand.  Okay, good.  Hey, he blinked three times!
Would you two numb skulls mind telling me what you're doing in music class anyway?
You told me your resolution was to sign up for an all natural slimming, toning, and increased muscle mass program!
Wow, those  impressive results.
As you may not be aware, music is a...  Music is a...  Music is a complicated series of...  ...is a complicated series of notes that when played in the...  SpongeBob, do you mind?! There are other people here besides you, you know. And I don't think they appreciate you depriving them of my wisdom!
You expect me to believe he was tickling himself?
You were tickling yourself?
How?
Alright, that's enough!
There. Now, as I was saying, music is a series of complex...  SpongeBob, I told you to stop tickling yourself!
Now, I'm going to put some notes on the chalkboard.  Excuse me? Is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?
Go on, you've already interrupted once. You might as well tell us what was so very important.
I have never heard anything more insipid, insane, uninteresting, or irrelevant!
I have never seen a more ridiculous looking outfit on top of anybody's head, anywhere!
What else did you buy at this convention? Your very own locomotive?
Ha! Ha! Ha! What the...?
Now, where were...  ...we?
This is what's known as a metronome.
No, SpongeBob, that was a garden gnome.
Anyway, the metronome helps us keep time.
Do you mind?  Is there something seriously wrong with your HEADS?!
Will you two nincompoops cut it out?! Or am I gonna...
Please ignore them.
Nope, they're just morons. Come on, you two, snap out of it!
Hotter? Scoop?!
Paranormal?! The only thing paranormal around here is how fast I'm going to make you two disappear!!
You wanna know what happened?
You once again managed to single-handedly annihilate what might be the one and only chance I may ever get to sew just one tiny seed of creative hope into the culturally barren wasteland that each and every one of us is forced to call home!
Now, I don't suppose you two have anything to say for yourselves?
No, no, no, no, no! Shh shh shh...
No, no, no, no, no! They said "Squilliam"!
No! Wait!  No! You're not going anywhere!
Wha-What's going on here?
But...
Have I told you how beautiful you are? Your tentacles, your nose, your eyes...a little lopsided.  There. And now that I've been immortalized in wax, I have conquered all artistic media. Come on, my precious reflection, smile!
Hey! What are you invertebrates doing?
Hey Patrick, do you know what time it is?
Time to find some other game to play!
What are you doing here?! Well? Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to...?
What is the matter with you two?
What are you two talking about?  Look what you've done to me! When I get my hands on you, I'll...
Enough! Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a a horrible fate. All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand.
Quiet! Now, do as you're told! Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!
Too hot.
No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going.
Toulouse-Lautrec.
Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy.  Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment.
Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that's very difficult to find.
Cherry pie.  Where'd you get that?
Well, go find it again!  SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around.  That's better. Now jog in place.  Say flank steak.
I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop.  Now, play me an elaborate song with this!
Oh, my.  Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo.
Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, because you're not allowed to leave that spot until I hear a song.  What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.
I'll take that!
Ow, what the heck was that?
Ceremony for what?
I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?
Well, I'm going to go check.
Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing.
I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!
Now what?
SpongeBob!  Cut that out!
SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?
SpongeBob, I have a confession to make.
No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!
Do it!
I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and please stop doing me favors.
D'oh!
SpongeBob? Don't you know that its 7:00 in the morning?
Don't you know that its 7:00 in thehuh?
Why is the local news always such rubbish!?
SpongeBob, nobody cares about...
Later.
Krabs is gone?
Wow.
Wake me up when I care.
No.
What?
And you ruined my regulary scheduled Krusty Krab nap?
This must be important. Mr. Krabs has never interrupted one of these before.
But being as you're the man in charge, you must have your reasons.
What is it?
You know, I'll let you serve this one. My stories are on.
So do it when you're done.
Would you like to hear a secret?
See that guy over there?
He wants to be a fry cook, and you're his hero!
Why don't you give him a couple of pointers. Let him cook his own patty, and don't take "no" for an answer. He's shy.  This should be good.
Moron.
Ha, ha! SpongeBob will believe anything!
SpongeBob, what're you doing?
You're serving Krabby Patties with your hands? Do you know how filthy your hands are?
But your feet however are clean. Think about it. Your feet have been protected by your shoes and socks all day.
What?
Oh, sorry.
What is this stuff?
Hey, SpongeBob, do you want to hear another Krusty Krab secret?
Do you want to know how Mr. Krabs gets all these customers?
Mr. Krabs keeps this place a dump, so the food's more better by comparison!
Ah, but you'll be doing it on purpose.
Lookin' good!
Mmm, you missed a spot.
Lower!
Perfect!
What did we talk about?
If you want the customers to stay, you need to provide some entertainment!
What?
It's official.  I hate everyone.  You imbeciles think that's entertainment? Brace yourself for true entertainment!
I'm entertaining those heathens.
Whatever.
Ready!
Don't look at me, I'm just here to hold his hat.
You want me to push you off your precarious perch into a bucket of spiny sea urchins? Oh, if only you were SpongeBob. OK, I'll do it!
Oh, I'm so happy for you!
Ladda-de ladd-dum ladda-do... Hey! What are you doing in my house?
Get out!
I believe this pile belongs to you.
They've all gone to the Chum Bucket.
Whatever.
That story gets better every time you tell it, SpongeBo
That was probably me.
What the?
You mean the front door  the back door?
What? I have never fallen asleep on duty.
All right, point taken.
You hired Patrick?
It only took you eleventy-seven years for you to figure that out?
Your letting SpongeBob decorate? Remember all the other times SpongeBob decorated?
No.
Battening down the word hatches, sir.
What? What are you...?
Are you getting any of this, SpongeBob?
and cold.
Which one? There must be 20 ways to go.
That's not the map, you old barnacle. those are  three moles and a birthmark.
It's this way.
We'll never get out of here.
Stop breathing on my neck. Yuck.
You left your TV on.
Mr. Krabs,  Why do you have cameras watching us?
Those are just sock garters, you idiot.
This is not happening. It's just not happening.
SpongeBob, if you had never come to Bikini Bottom, this wouldn't be happening.
I was just  remembering the world before SpongeBob.
Good Morning, Not SpongeBob.
My secret garden is finally done.
Oh, give me that.  Snady, come in, Sandy.
What? No. I'm just-- I
No.
Yes.
I never made anyone sick with envy.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
We went through all that for nothing?!
Oh, no. He's not going to sing.
Mr. Krabs, look.
Laa da dee, laa da da, laa da doo. Got ya. Now just one quick flick of the wrist, and
Grr!
No! I what storm?
Who's that?
I can't understand a word you're saying.
Well, I think I'll pass.
Hmm, I'll have to think about that.
What's better about it? I liked it better before, when I could see!
Yes, they did, when you turned them off!
Oh, boy. How about some of those games you promised?
This is tic-tac-toe. You don't roll to see who goes first.
Three!
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
There, I win. See?
What do you mean, you're not seeing anything?! There's three in a row right here. Tic-tac-toe!
Grrr!
I told you creatures I was trying to take a nap over here. Now for the last time can't you just
It's the last piece of the puzzle! There's only one place it can go. Right here!
Cheating?! It's a jigsaw puzzle! You can't cheat!
I've got to get out of here!
No, I can't.
No way.
I have an even better idea.
Shh. Quiet time. It's a game called "boundaries."
Yes, Patrick?
Oh, no, no spelling.
It's very simple. The object of the game is to see how long everyone leaves Squidward alone until the storm passes. He will stay inside boundaries, he'll define by chalk lines on the floor.
What?
I brought some!
Brilliant work, as usual, Squidward. Now all I have to do is sit here until this storm blows over.  Wait a minute. I'm starving. SpongeBob's got to have some snacks around here somewhere. Ah, Jackpot.  I bet you wish you had some of this, don't? Snail food?  I've got to get some real food.
I'm the one who drew the line. You're not supposed to cross.
Identific? Fine. But when this storm blows over, you'll regret this, mister. What the what? I don't have them. they must be in my other pants. Look, if you just let me cross, I can go get them. Please, I promise I'll
Oh, thank you. I'm just so hungry.
That'll be the day.
Please. I just want to get back onto my side of boundary.
But all I wanted was something to eat.
Whoa!
My food!
Is this what we've really come to? Is one little storm all it takes to turn us all into complete animals?
Did you hear that?
No, no, no, no, no, no, not that. I mean from outside.
The storm must've stopped.
Woooo-hoooo! So long, suckers!
Oof! Oh, curse you, Preflumster!
Not in the least, SpongeBob.
Your order, ma'am.
Now, what?
Well, it wouldn't be the first time you've ruined everything, but the worst part is those 5,000 Krabby Patties that will end up going rotten in the hot sun.
I do have a way with words.
Whatever it is, no.
Go on.
Pizazz. Hold on to your hats and glasses, people, because Squidward the Fantabulous has arrived.
Thank you. Thank you. This next one, I wrote myself. I like to call it, 'Three Barnacles are a Crowd Unless They've Known Each Other for a Really Long Time.'
Careful, this is made out of imported wood, imported all they way from the junk pile out the back.
The only thing that can usually do that is something that causes more pain.
If pleases the king, I would like to preform a...
What the?
I think he wants us to look at the O MY!
All of the most intelligent programming starts before 5 AM.
No, no, no. Take your time. It's worth the wait.
How sophisticating!
Oh, yeah, I haven't made the coffee yet.  Why in the world would they cancel "Fab and Fancy?" What could possibly be more enriching?  What?!
He obviously doesn't know the first thing about music! This is an outrage!
Where is my "Fab and Fancy?!"
I'm quite certain you wouldn't know culture if it bit you on the guitar!
Do they just give a show to just anybody over there?
Really?
It's that easy?  Hello? Bikini Bottom Public Access?  Give me a TV show! Give me a TV show! I want a show!  Come on! Just a few more minutes, Squiddie, and it will be your turn to bask in the limelight!
Like, I would tell you! Hmph...  Although, I've waited my whole life to have enough glory to rub it in someone's face. Anyone's face.  Even that face. Okay! I'll tell you, but the last thing I would want is for you to show up so plug your ears!  Well, I don't want to toot my own whistle, but... Wait, no! That's exactly what I mean to do!  Oh!
Greetings. I'm Squidward Tentacles, your host of "Squidward Chat".   Today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing something near and dear to my heart, under-appreciated artists like myself.
I know I'm on TV! See the camera?  You're on TV too!
Moron. As I was saying, today, on Squidward Chat, we'll be discussing...
This isn't happening!
Patrick, just how dumb are you?
If you want to be on TV, you have to be in front of the camera!
Patrick, SpongeBob, get off my camera!  Would you get out of here?
If you like the camera so much, why don't you be the cameraman?
That means you take all the pretty pictures.
Fine. You can be the soundman.
Imbeciles!  Today, we're going to be talking about...  Why isn't the camera on me? No! I'm the one talking!  I'm right here! Ahem! Today on Squidward Chat... we'll be discussing the under-appreciated arts.  Patrick, I'm down here!  As I was saying, today, we'll be...  Today...
Now then, I was going to tell you about my fabulous...  Sponge...!
Well, you'll just have to hold it, Patrick! Now, if there are no more interruptions...
Out!
Nooo! My show!
Cut that out!  That's it! Everyone, out!  What do you think this is, huh? Some kind of housewarming?!
Get off my set! This is not working!
Me?
Keep it down! I'm trying to sleep!
The coast looks clear...
That's funny. Even a barnacle knows you need music to dance.
That is  stupidest dance move I've ever seen!
Would you please stop dancing?
You got a dance audition?
That idiot has a dance audition? He doesn't know the first thing about the subtle intricacies of dance!  Let him practice till he drops! He's never gonna get that part.  That's it! He'll just have to practice 'til he drops! When he does, I'll be there all leotarded up and ready to show my stuff!  Oh, SpongeBob! SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob... ...duh, I mean, uh... ... I suppose I could take you under my tutelage, you know, show you a few moves.
But, you must do exactly what I say. Got that?
Hmm...
Oh, um, just a physical assessment I do with all of my new pupils.  Yeah, I'd say judging from the condition of those flabby ankles...
That's right. You need some physical conditioning before you  set foot on a dance parquet. I want you to run to the top of Oyster Peak then back. {
By the time that idiot gets back, he'll be too tired to dance!
What are you doing here?
Fine!  Let's move on to our first dance lesson.  I want you to moonwalk on this treadmill while I read this entire novel!
Huh? Huh? What, is he still at it?  Huh?  My treadmill!
All right! You wanna learn some ?! I'll show you dancing!  You know what gets people going? Ribbons!
Now, do just as I did.
Okay, try this.  It's simple.  And a real showstopper.  Pay close attention.  Now you.
You want to ace the audition, don't you?
Then do it!  Enough! Listen, you pea-brain, we are gonna keep working on your routine until you get it right!  And I don't care how long it takes! Now, watch closely.  And a-one...  And a-two...  And aha!! You think you can handle that?
Then go and practice it, and don't stop until you've done exactly as I did.
Remember, don't stop till you've done it right.
Better go check on the little yellow sea-monkey's progress.  Well, SpongeBob, have you learned the moves?
Aw, come on, now. After all I've done for you? We've got one day, SpongeBob.
Let's go, let's go! We're burning daylight.
I'm still not convinced.  Do it again.
Good night, sweet prince, and hello, stardom for yours truly.
Only  best dancer in Bikini Bottom.
Observe a true master at work.
Oh, baby, I knew it!  You won't be sorry you made this decision.
Squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squ--squidawa!
Not so fast! That crab is a food thief! He snuck into my house in the middle of the night, stole every last morsel in my kitchen, and he even swiped my entire collection of smoked kielbasas.
I don't care. I'm calling the police.
Oh? And why is that?
Hello, police?
You'll what? You'll give me your golden tooth?
Neither did I.
It's about time.  Hey SpongeBob, love the outfit. Where'd you get it, the hardware store?!  Hardware store!
Well, I must say, it really completes your imbecile look. Way to go, buddy.
Please just get away from me.
I'm gonna blow a fuse if you don't get that order up.
SpongeBob, where's the Krabby Patty for order 17?
Can you just get the Krabby Patty?
Don't know, don't want to.
What are you doing?
All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?
Annoy Squidward Day?
SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?
Mr. Krabs gives you that award so you'll work harder for no extra money.
Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame?
That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you.
Need some help?  What are you doing?
You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of...  ...garbage.
I already told you, that award is a bunch of...  ...baloney!
It's a symbol that you're a chump!
And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award!
I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke!
SpongeBob? What are you doing here?
Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!
You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!
Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!
Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm going to show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm going to be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!
Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!
I don't need to sleep! Loser!
I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me.
No, how about you?
SpongeBob!
I'm going to wring you dry when I get out of here! Now get me out of here!
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
That oughta hold him!
SpongeBob! Why you little!
So long, Sponge loser!  SpongeBob? Truce?
SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!
Ok, let's have a good clean fight.
Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him.
...I'm gonna make a run for it.
Clean tables, Mr. Krabs!
Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs!
There's nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I'll easily double you output, Sponge-Hog!
And would you have Kelp Fries with that?
SpongeBob, order  up.
Medium.
And it's taken you this long to figure that out?
So?
Mr. Krabs, I hope whatever you're yelling about is something more important than my mid-morning nap!
Deluxe Krabby Patties.  Juuust what the world needed.
P.U, Mr. Krabs!
Don't you usually flush that stuff down the toilet?
I'll give you points for honesty.
No, and I want you to stop calling me Squidsy.
What do you think you're doing?
No, I'm not!
I don't care! Now get back in the kitchen!
Krabs is letting you go today?  As in I won't have to work with you ever again.
Another beautiful Sunday in Bikini Bottom. Nothing can ruin my good mood today!
Ignoring, ignoring!  Chewing gum!? That's disgusting!  Oh c'mon!  People who litter really bug me!  Litterbugs  Litterbugs!
Bugs... litter... litter... bugs
Yes I did, and I like to complain!
What? No! no no, I just stepped in it!
Bikini Bottom P.D Ticket for littering. Penalty: Community service?!
Stupid Policeman, I'm no litter bug!  Hey! No more trash! Looks like I'm done!
Can things get any worse?
Daagh! Squilliam Fancyson! My arch foe from band class!
No! I... um... er... volunteering! Yeah, I'm cleaning up Bikini Bottom, selflessly devoting my time to a worthy cause.
Hmph! I'll clean up Bikini Bottom in a day!
Squilliam thinks he sooo amazing!  Phew!  Hmmm,I've gotta find some place to dump this litter.  Oh oh oh! Perfect!  Full! They're all full! How am I gonna hold all this...
What? No!
Hey! Hold on! Stop! I'm not the garbage man!  Help.
Why are you in a trash bag?
No thank you! I'll do it myself.
No.
No.
No way!
Listen closely, I don't need your help! I would rather be beaten to a pulp!
Alright! Fine! You can help me.
Well... you gonna help me!?
Why?
Fine!  Now what?
Oh brother.
Oh this is so stuuuuuu...  ...pid. It's gone! Where did you put the trash?
Know what? Don't care! The trash is gone. Thanks SpongeBob I hate you a little less now.
Well I don't know how you did it but thank you for getting rid of all that trash. They'll have that statue of me built in no time!  My house!
Yes.
SpongeBob. what's this?
Where's my house?
How?
Of all the garbage that comes out of your mouth,this is the least annoying.
Wait! Zip it! I have an idea!  Here stand in this.  See ya sucker!
Neptune no!
They were gonna make a statue of me!
What is that?!
Really?!  Garbage. I'm made of garbage
Hhhhhha! Thanks SpongeBob!
Can I help you?
Adorable.
Yes.
That'll be $4.99.
No.
I hate them.
SpongeBob, one extra large order of sea fries.
Please.
Yes. Yes it was.
One large sea fries. Extra weird.
Ahh. La-da-dee-la-da-dum-la-da-doo!
Where's my trowl?
Oh, here it is.
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! You morons would probably...  You want to play with my lawnmower?
Hmmm...
Knock yourselves out!
I knew I shouldn't have lent them my lawnmower.
He's a ghost, Mr. Krabs.
Ahh.. What a day!
Not a problem SpongeBob, not a problem at all!
Good morning sir! Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
1 Krabby Patty coming up!
Even better, I have a clarinet recital immediately after work today! So ain't nothing gonna ruin my day.
No need! See? Not a drop!
Grr.. I can't take this any more!
This is unacceptable!
This!
This is an outrage! I no longer tolerate my personal items being soiled by the ravels that crawls in this restaurant! I demand a place to put my stuff!
You ever read this?
It specifically states that all employers must provide his or her employees with a secure, clean place to store personal property.
Not at a whale's age.
Ohh, I suppose I can share but only since it requires by law. Hey! This thing is filthy! You don't expect me to clean it?!
Impressive indeed. Just keep your grubby little hands to your side.
Just don't touch my clarinet!
Order up, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing? You're supposed to be fry cooking. I told you not to touch my stuff!
Velvet..
And here's your change, mam.
What is that idiot doing now?!
I hope you're not trying to shove the boxes into that locker!
If you smashed my clarinet-- so help me, Neptune-- I will
Well it's all fine and dandy, but where's my clarinet?
Fine. but remember, It's vitally important that nothing happens to it
What's he doing?!
Alright what do you want?
Yeah, Just a bit of a... renovation.
My clarinet! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob?
There. 368-B
a note?!
SpongeBob?!
10182-E.
Another note?!
SpongeBob?! SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob, Wait!
What have you done to my-
SpongeBob I do not play games.
Where am I? What is this place?
Hey, come back! I need my clarinet! Come Back! Where are you? Sponge-
uuhh.. I'm.. trying to find my clarinet.
Yes, my clarinet! Which I am the proud owner.
You calling me a liar?!
I'm sorry I-I-I didn't mean to offend you.
I've learned..  I've learned respect...
Stand still you idiot!
I got you now!
ha ha! Wha the- SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!
You tell me what in the wide world of sports is this place? And how did you get so big?
What are talking about?
Where are you going you imbecile?!
Almost... Gotcha!
-Such a nightmare!
I tried to get my clarinet in there...  Impossible!
Where did you get that?!
Grrr...
I'll show you a friendly gesture! Do you know the horror I've endured?!  Let's see how you like it!
Ahh!
Yes, yes I am; as a matter of fact, you wouldn't believe what I had to go through to get-
I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I actually would like to help, but I'm just too busy right now.
I'm too busy telling you, "NOOOOOOO!"
Well, I'm going to go soak my tentacles.  It's cold in here underneath all of this concrete!
Really. We haven't had a customer since the day this highway was built!
I don't care what it is! I'm out of here!
Eugene, what is Zed-9er9er!!?? And more importantly, how does it affect me!?
Eugene!
Not this time, little fella.
And what?
Look on the bright side, at least I don't have to put up with you anymore! Ha,ha! This could be the start of something beautiful! OW! What the-!
Yeah, but for some reason, I don't think they're here to trade gift baskets!
I've come for your pickle!
Steal your soul.
What are you supposed to be?
I don't get it.
SpongeBob.
That SpongeBob is such a crybaby. And lucky me I get to work with him all day.
SpongeBob, will you stop crying?!
Krabby Patty nothing!  KRABBY PATTY NOTHING!!!  What now?
All right, look. So far today, and it's not even 2:00 yet, you have cried 43 times.
Yes!
I have no idea.
Au contraire.
It's a quick montage of flashbacks I've edited together that shows the hundreds of tears you have cried over the years.
Oh, nonsense! I bet you can't go the rest of the day without crying.
Fine. If you cry one tear before midnight, you have to...  Wash my bike, clean out my rain gutters, and do all my yard work for a year.
Um, nothing, I just threw up a little in my mouth.  No need to worry, Squiddy. You've outdone yourself. He'll be crying in ten minutes.
There's a first time for everything.  Also, I'd like to win this bet as soon as possible.
Do what?  Oh, my! What a lovely sunset. Take a look, SpongeBob.  Isn't that beautiful?
Really tugs the heartstrings, doesn't it?
Is that a tear I see?
Nice of you to have me, I-- Oh, look SpongeBob. Gary's sleeping.
That is just so adorable. Almost makes you want to cry.
Oh, SpongeBob.
Your mail's here. Ooh, oh look, it's a postcard from your dear mother and father so far away.
"Dear SpongeBob, we are having a wonderful time in the South Seas and we miss you very, very much.
No problem.
Ooh, let's turn it up.
Fine!
It's getting late. I'd better bring out the big guns.  Oh, SpongeBob.
What would you say to a little music?
Don't be long. My secret weapon is waiting.
Oh, I just said, "Relax and enjoy the song."
You're not gonna cry though, are you?
Uh, SpongeBob. No-no-no-no, wait.
How about a bedtime story?
Umm...  How 'bout The Little Angler Who Got Lost?
Oh, very sad. Umm... "There once was a little angler  who was, uh, little and sad.  One day the little sad angler was walking through the park.
But, he was sad, because...because he was lost... he was lost and very sad. And then, he he started to cry.  He cried and he cried. And he cried even more.  And he kept crying...  ...and crying and crying and crying and...that's right. You can do it.
You're exactly right, SpongeBob. Let it all out. Don't fight the feel-- Ten, nine...do it, do it, cry...eight, seven, six, five...come on!  ...four, three, two, one!  Midnight!  Well, SpongeBob, it looks like you won the...
No, no. No, no. Please.
Hey! It's hard to get my beauty sleep when people keep dropping junk on my head.
Hooray! Yahoo!
WHOOPEE! Ha ha ha! Whoopee! Woo-
Whoo-
Whoop...
I'm holding a package from famous producer Buddy Barracuda. I sent him my play and now, he's gonna produce it!
I quit.
So long, losers!
Let's see here. Ahem. Oh, yeah.
"Thank you for submitting your play, entitled 'Squidward: Strokes of Genius'. Your work speaks volumes about you as an artist, a person, and a member of society."
So it is with great pleasure that we announce we will not be doing your play.
Well, I suppose that could work. If people see my play, they'll recognize my genius! And I'll become famous and-
But my play doesn't have singing-
Dinner theater?
But SpongeBob, there's no singing in my-
Wow! Look at all these aspiring actors wanting to take part in my genius!
You got all the parts.
And we let him handle our food?
It's time!
Places, people, places!
Dim the house lights.
Bring up the stage lights!
Raise the curtain!
Onto this world, an octopus was born. A cephalopod with promise and potential.
Go away, go away, shoo, shoo, go away, go away.
Fine.
He had promise until he came to work here, at the Krusty Krab. Serving local morons heart-stopping, artery-clogging garbage, masquerading as food.
At the Krusty Krab, his talent was wasted.
No, you ca-
Sigh...Yes, you can.
But, who will refill the empty chasm in my soul?
His life shattered. Is there any task too demeaning for our hero?
It would appear not. No ketchup! That's terrible! Here, let me help you with that.
Would any of you want this job?
And then, there's my skinflint boss.
Umm, Mr. Krabs, I'm acting.
Fine. SpongeBob! One Krabby Patty with ketchup! And now, we come to the worst part of my job...working with him.
You don't have any lines!
Doh! Just stand there and act like...yourself!
Talent.
Outstanding. Thank you, that'll do. Ahem. But, lo and behold-
His genius was unrecognized.
Taken for granted, uncredited, overlooked, ignored. Disrespected, unappreciated, unloved. But worst of all...underpaid.
And furthermore!
Unfulfilled. In a word, his myriad of talents were, wasted.
All right! SpongeBob, where's that Patty?!
Uh huh.
Here! Enjoy!
Oh, puh-leeze. You wouldn't know quality if it hit you in the face!
Doh! I said if it hit YOU in the face!
Oh boy.
Oh, no! Sallys in trouble!
Dont worry, SpongeBob. Just wait right here.  Ill get my emergency squirrel rescue kit!
Just dont panic!
SpongeBob, the next time you invite me to one of your slumber parties, Im calling the cops!   Arrgh, Arrgh, oh, oh. What the? SpongeBob!
: SpongeBob, you have been warned about lurking back here on your days off!
: Your what?
: Right... SpongeBob, I promise not to tell Mr. Krabs about this if you promise that I don't have to see you again for the rest of the day.
Keep looking. You'll find someone who cares.
I live here.  And what's so funny?
I'll have you know, sir, that  is a-- pile of gravel?!
Alert the what?
He likes me. Officer, arrest me right now, because I am about to throw a horrible tantrum that no one around here wants to see.
Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?
What's a Gary?
Yuck. You actually care for that thing?
Well, I don't. Get somebody else.
Go away?  You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?
As in, not here for three days?
I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.
Friday, Saturday and Sunday. A three-day weekend.
Sure it's enough?
Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye-bye.
I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred.
Right, yeah, right.  Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers!  They're gone!
This is going to be the best three days of my life.  I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob.  Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me.   The snail! I forgot the snail!  I've got to do something.  Okay, okay ,okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here.  Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat. You've gotta finish this food!
Come on, eat! Eat! Eat!  Ohh...
Hi, SpongeBob.
Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.
So, uhh, well, see you. Good-bye.
Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.
Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do...
Okay, okay, I'll do it.
Will you hold him still?
Well, you made me do it.
Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.
I'm telling you, its all in your head.
He just needed water?
Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night.
Trust me SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine.
I hope I never see another snail again. Good night, Clary.  Who could that be? As if I didn't already know.  SpongeBob, I already told you. You're gonna be just fi-i-i...
SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done?  It's all your fault.  Okay, okay, okay, okay, get it together, Squidward.
None of this would be happening if I'd only fed the snail!
Uh-oh!
Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow  .
Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow  .
Meow , me-  Ommf!
Meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow , meow ..
AAAAAAHHH!!!! She's gone! My clarinet has gone missing!
Nope, I'm right here.
Drama queen.
I'm missing my clarinet.
Maybe he's doing his morning dumpster dive for change.
Oh no, is that a mermaid song?
Ohh no!!
OOOHHHH! This is the Bikini Bottom Triangle? Looks more like a dump.
Oh, my neck.
Would you shut it already?!
Oh, I think Mr. Krabs is doing just fine.
He looks fine to me.
Hello, miserable life, I'm back.
Ohh yeah, that's nice. I'll be here working while you.....AHHHHHHHH!  Uhhhh. Uhhh...Ummmm...I'm sorry mam,  but were closed. . I know you're hungry but- . Uhhh...but we really are closed. Thank-you, come-again.
Hey!! Closed means closed, Grandma!  Oh boy, Some people...
I told you...we're closed! I was supposed to get out of here ten minutes ago! And besides, I already cashed the register out.
No.
No.
No way.
Never...
Ah-ha, that is what they cost...20 years ago. Krabby Patties cost $4.50, lady.
Nope.
What a creepy old hagfish, I thought she'd never leave.
Or before he takes off his sleep mask.
You're asking the wrong guy about curses, I live next to SpongeBob
And why is that?
That's not a curse.  That's a blessing.
I just remember there is a no-curse clause in my contract, nice working with you.
There is a no-contract clause in it too.
Hold that thought.  SpongeBob, what is all that r...
No! I do not want a Krabby Patty!
Don't touch me.
I've seen what he cleans the grill with.
Another miserable day...
Owwwwwww. That's better...
Oh is that supposed to be singing?  I am putting that one on SpongeBob.  Would you clam up, SpongeBob? I am trying to paint in here!
SpongeBob, why are you doing this?
Gratitude? You've been wallowing in filth all morning. What could you possibly be grateful for?
Keep you and your gratitude to yourself! Because having you as a neighbor has left me with nothing to be grateful for!
This is your fault!
No, SpongeBob. I don't want your help EVER AGAIN!
Moron.  Stupid pipe!  Oh, great. I'm late for work, again!
Don't jump in a coral pit.
Ha ha ha.
Stop staring, SpongeBob.
That'll will be 3 dollars.
I don't have time to count all that!
Oh, please do, I'm trying to get some work done here. Sheesh, some people just want to waste your time.  Hey, buddy, how am I supposed to focus with all of that insesant tapping? And what do you think you're doing, sir?
No, you're not. You're leaving your grummy finger prints all over the glass! And now yours truly is gonna have to clean it up! Why does everyone insist on making my job so difficult?!  You always leave trash on the table!  Your teeth chatter!  Your hat annoys me!  You take too long in the restroom!  And SpongeBob, would you quit singing that song?
SpongeBob, I hate my job, and I live in a dead end town with neighbors I can't stand. I'm the most miserable person in Bikini Bottom! What do I have to be thankful for?
How could life in Bikini Bottom POSSIBLY get any worse?
Oh, boy. Morons.
Don't know, don't care.
But, Squidward, it is imperative that we...  NOTHING! I think I'd rather take my chances with the volcano than be stuck in this miserable barnacle hole with you, [] and the citizens of Dumb-Dumb Town!
For the last time, we're out of patties.  No need to get excited now.
That's Krusty Krab property.  That's a load-bearing column.  Hurry, SpongeBob.
Stop playing...
Well, pick one, and leave my yard out of it!
I choose Patrick...  to play in Patrick's yard...  and SpongeBob in SpongeBob's yard. And nobody...
Must... block... out... noise!
I thought I told you two to stay off my...  yard.  Patrick!  Patrick, would you shut...?  Where is he?  SpongeBob.  SpongeBob!  SpongeBob, I am trying to...  sleep?    Hey, Gary.
Where are those two morons?  WHERE ARE THEY?!
My house!
I knew you two reprobates were behind this.
That was an insult.
Why were you digging under my yard?
But you buried my house!
THANK YOU?!?
RRRRRRRR!
Now, you're gonna play a new game called, "Digging Out my House!"
And I'm gonna play "Sit and Relax" until you're finished.  Barnacle Brains.  SpongeBob!
RRRRRRRRRRRR!
I'm warning you: If you don't put my house back where it belongs by the count of th-ree-  Three. I am going to grind you into Chum! One!
Twwwwwwwwwooooooo!
Th-ree!
You... two... morons... SUNK MY HOUSE!
I'M GONNA-  Uh, oh.
I hate neighbors.
What's this? Hhmmm... haven't seen this before.
A... What?
Whatever.
Garbage. That'll be a $5 contribution fee.
No, thank you for completely failing our future generations with your donation. I mean, seriously, ma'am, did you just grab the first thing you saw this morning?
"Hmm. Oh, whatever shall I donate to the time capsule? Golly, this is hard! How about  this lamp?! It's  perfect!"
Next.
Uh-huh. Tell me, what do you know about this plate?
Right. This plate is actually  meant to be eaten on. Now with your permission, I'd like to perform a few tests to verify its authenticity.
Uh-huh.  Interesting.  This is a promising sign. Yep.  You hear that plate-hitting-skull sound? It's definitely authentic. And I would price it conservatively in today's market at $250.
No.
Next.
Sorry, Patrick, but there's no way I'm letting you put your dumb rock in the time capsule. I've allowed some seriously ridiculous items today, but this is where I draw the line. Do you unders...?
Oh, no, you don't!
Get off me!
That's it, this game is
Wha...? Oh! Has it been 50 years already?  Yes! I knew I'd still be hot!
Hello, future!  Yes! Huh? What the...?! Where's my museum? The future is the same as my old pathetic life! Forget this! I'm waiting another 50 years!
Dig me out when my life doesn't stink.
Okay, beloved sanctuary. I'll see you after work.  And we'll have a nice, relaxing evening.  Just you and me.  That is, Of course, if I can survive another day  with GratingBob ShrillPants.
Hm.  Wow. Those two are just so amazingly stupid.
Grrr!
Okay. I can do this. Just put them out of my mi...
A nine-letter word for annoying: SpongeBob.  Ugh.  Finally. Some peace and quiet.  No more SpongeBob, Just me, myself and home sweet home.  Ahh. Nothing like a squid's good ol' chair to soothe the pains of a rough day. Just relax and contemplate some me time.  Perhaps I will dance to some soothing dance records.  Or I could dabble a little on painting!  Yup. I sure am looking forward to it.
No, no, no!  Alright, I am trying to have a relaxing evening. What are you two doing?
You're playing flashlight tag with an electric eel?
Advanced rules.
All I want to do is live in a world where I can just relax in peace  and quiet.  Is that too much to ask?
All I want to do is live in a world where I can live in peace!
Good night... lamp.
I can't take it anymore!
When I get those two, I am gonna...!  All right, you two, I...
It's, it's, it's... beautiful! it's a mirage! I knew it!
Next stop, padded room at the cephalopod home!  Just go with it, Squiddy.
It's delicious! What is it?
Remember, just go with it.
Hit it boys!
Ahhhh, this is the life!
I've never felt this happy in my life!
My world!
You've destroyed my beautiful world!
Yeah, make it last,
I know how to make it last!
I think I'll treat Bikini Bottom to some real music.  Yow!
I wonder who that could be.
No, I'm not ready to go!
No!
No!  Huh?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!  No!  What?!
No, I'm not ready! I'll never be ready! Don't you get it?!
What?  D'oh...!
Out! Sheesh! Shouldn't you be at work today, SpongeBob?!
Hold on a second. I'll be right out.  Hello...?  Ahh, alone at last.
A-ha! They're finally gone!  What the...?  Locked?! Oh no! Oh, well, someone will realize I'm gone and come looking for me. I'll be out of here in no time.
I'll be out of here in no time.
Sp... SpongeBob? Is that you?
What?
Uh, the future...  Huh?! O-okay, uh, what's going on here? Why is everything... chrome?
Wha...?  Oh, my...  Impossible! He's lying!  He's right!
Are the other letters of the alphabet involved here?
Future! Future! Future! Future!  Thanks. Now listen! All of you! I don't belong here. This is all a horrible mistake! Please, we've got to do something!
J-just listen to me! I'm not supposed to be here! I've gotta get home to my own time period! I've gotta go!
Well, I wouldn't've chosen this interior...  Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past!
What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them!  Give me those loincloths!  I can't believe it.  This oughta make things go a little smoother!  Give me those things! You're supposed to catch them, like this!  It's called jellyfishing.  Ah, finally.  Arrgh! Get me outta here!  Uh-oh.
He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all...  ...alooooooone.
I gotta get outta of here!  Where's the time machine?! Where's anything? Where, where, where, where?!  I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I miss Bikini Bottom! I miss my Easter Island head! I even miss SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! Patrick!
Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I-I-I was in space, a-and I went to the future, and-and then I went to the past, and-and then-then I was nowhere, but now I'm back, and-and... you don't know how happy I am to see you guys.
No! D'oh! Who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway?
I'm going back.
Oh fun. I suppose you want me to play some stupid game, or you'll just follow me around all day and never ever leave, huh?
You don't know how long I've waited to hear those words!
Would you stop that incessant babbling!?
Would you quit it with that tune already?
I don't care. Just can it!
I'll cleanse myself by listening to a little public radio.
Figures you would be into that hideous pop fodder.
A sign that you're a true boob?
Great, now I hate two things.
FREEDOM!
Oh, he's obsessed with  his artless pop tune.
Alright. I'll do it. But only because you required an artist of such high talent.
It's called a clarinet.
Alright. You're greatful. Now leave me alone.
That was a near little tune I came up with today, if I do say so myself.
Oh, yeah. That's catchy stuff, Squiddy. Catchy stuff. Mmm-hmm.
La da dee, la da dum, la da doo...
No!
WHAT?!
No.
Shut it SpongeBob. Gil is about to reveal his secret.
I knew it!
Oh, boy.
He's talking about me.
For the love of all things briny, it's me!
For those who care, I am nothing short of an artistic genius.
Unfortunately, that precludes me from doing any commercial pieces. Good-bye.
Are you suggesting the Krabby Patties are art?
Oh, I don't know, 12?
(sighs) All right, Krabs, I'll do it. But I will need complete artistic control.
Yes, tomtomorrow!
I can't make a work for the ages overnight. Art does not march to a ticking clock. Art shall come when art is good and ready, sir.
I'll need an assistant.
Fine. The first thing I need you to do, assistant, is get me a giant stone so that I may sculpt this masterpiece.
And don't dilly... (SpongeBob pushes a giant stone into the Krusty Krab) ...dally. Nice rock.
I'm gonna be famous.
Prepare to be immortalized in stone.
I am posing you! Did you think the sculpture was going to make itself? (shot of Mr. Krabs from behind) Don't you want the money this statue's going to bring in? (Mr. Krabs drops the towel)
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Mm. (gets an idea) Hold that pose! Don't move a muscle. (chuckles)
As long as it takes. (Squidward uses various tools for sculpting. SpongeBob poses for a bit but Squidward sends him away. Mr. Krabs grows tired of the post but SpongeBob helps him out by putting a spoon and fork under his arms to help them stay up. Cut to next morning where Squidward gets finished with the sculpture and sighs)
All done. (the spoon and fork break into pieces and Mr. Krab's left arm snaps)
Make sure you wear sunglasses, or you may be blinded by my genius.
Voila! (Mr. Krabs frowns after looking it then shatters into pieces)
This is a masterpiece.
It represents the gaping, mashing maw of consumerism and the endless cavern it creates within us all. I call it Oppression.
This is art, not a swing set!
It is not a doohickey, it's art!
What, you wanted a piece or art and that's what you got.
As long as you're wanting to sell this many patties. (Mr. Krabs groans)
Yep, that's one angry mama.
And this affects me, how?
We're closed. Come back tomorrow.
Gesundheit.
So, these things went crazy just because they had the sniffles?
Oh, so hilarious.
Can you two be quiet?!
Didn't think so. What are you barnacle heads doing, anyway?
Why would you want to practice such horrible sounds?
It must very challenging for you!
Well, you two have fun with your mutual ignominious society.
Morons.
Just pick one! And there's another three where that came from!
The suspense is killing me!
Magic.
Sigh...Once in awhile, I need to breathe in and not smell grease. Or the stench of my miserably failed life...Talking to myself...again...
Excruciating...
$4.99!? That's highway robbery!
Pinch yourself you ninny.
I don't know. That's a pretty long talk.
Actually, yes.
Being hired.
SpongeBob, my boy, I realized long ago that there is nothing, I repeat, nothing, that could make this job any more boring, or humiliating, or demeaning, that it already is.
SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob, I never thought I'd be saying this, but, count me in!
Help! I'm having horrible abdominal pain! I think it was the the  Line.
The wiener!
It only seems to have increased their appetite for wieners.
Like something that would make Mr. Krabs' wiener thing blow right up in his face!
.
Well, I guess I was wrong again. It can always get more humiliating.
SpongeBob... SpongeBob... SpongeBob... SpongeBob! What are you doing? I've been saying I needed a Krabby Patty about a bajillion times! And you w What the...? Ha, ha, ha! Nice patty, Michelangelo! Ha!  I hope you're not expecting an award anytime soon. Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Forest freak.
Hmm, a gum wrapper and a coin that says "Mauna Loa".
Well, I guess that explains this.
Actually, I have a hot date with my toenail clippers tonight, but I thought of that.
Welcome to The Wreck of the Mauna Loa. Arr. How may I help you?
Three patties, four large oyster skins, on the double, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob!
I'm going to pretend that didn't happen.  Now fill these orders or leave, SpongeBob. We're very busy today!
SpongeBob! Now are you gonna...
SpongeBob, did you get those bathrooms mopped yet?
Go!
I hate all of you.
It's finally complete!  After weeks and weeks of burning the candle at both ends,  literally,  my first clarinet concerto is complete and ready to be performed!  NO!  Now, I'm flummoxed.  Drggh.
Drrrrrgh! All right, what's going on out here? I can't even hear myself think!
No.  As I was saying, you two...
No!
Shut it! What are you two dingbats doing?
For rent? You mean one of you is moving out?
Wow! To think this day started off so horribly and now... What do you mean you're just gonna rent out your front yard?
Oh great, now another idiot can move in.
Oh I would love to. Just let me check my planner.
Oh no, I'm sorry I can't.
It's because I was planning to do "No such thing"! See?
With those two bone bags gone, I now have enough time for some peace and...  ...quiet.  Now what are those two boobs up to? I thought you guys were...  Hmmm. I wonder who was making all that noise.
Hello, Howard.
Sorry, you're too late.
Aren't we all?
Passions?
The bassoon?
I can't believe what I am hearing.  Finally, a neighbor that has it! I can only imagine! Painting portraits while sipping tea, recumbent bicycling into a museum, and performing a duet at the Bikini Bottom concert!
Wait!  I was...just kidding!
Wow, his designs are impeccable!  Yes, I do feel "at home".
To a new neighbor!
Oh! Well, they're just like any other neighbors.
Well, that's nice!
Well, that's nice.
Well, you won't even NOTICE what the neighbors around here are like!
Oh no!
Nope, nobody's out there!
There's nobody here!
No! I can't let you do that!
No! You REALLY don't wanna go out there, trust me!
Oh, sorry. I was just wondering if we could...
Um, form a little duet together. Just you and me. Just the two of us. Together. You know. Me on clarinet and you on bassoon. Why sure!
Phew! That was close.
Squiddy, this is definitely your best day ever!
Uh, that's me! I think this reed needs replacing. Excuse me for a moment!  There! Now, where were we?
Excuse me one more time!
Why, Howard, I would never hide anything from you!
Please don't leave, Howard! You're the rain of sunshine I've had in years!
Oh, Neptune nooooo!
I know I can handle two dunderheads, but I draw the line at three!
Well, I almost had a decent neighbor.
Well, Squiddy, what have I got to lose?  Hey, come back here you bubble!  JELLYFISHING BUBBLE BLOWERS!
Try reading the sign, Casanova.
Even the illiterate find love.  Oh, Squidward, why are you torturing yourself with tales of romance?
That's no "ook". That's just a cruel reminder that I'm single, and will likely be that way forever.
I like my frowns in their regular orientation.
Great, let the tired cliches cascade forward.  That'll make me feel better.
Who-who is that? She's got da-da-da-da-da...  She's, wow!
She speaks art jargon!
SpongeBob, she's got it all! Class, style, grace, and looks like yours truly!
My next move exactly! Observe the old tentacles and all of its glory!
SpongeBob, I don't know what I'm doing! I've never felt like this before.
She's talking to me. What do I do?
She's leaving!
Don't forget artistic and musical.
Okay.
What do you mean?
SpongeBob, you've gotta help me! It's been so long! What do I do?
That's it! I'll go on...  a practice date?
Sometime today would be nice.
Dear Neptune!
Um...You look...stunning?
What! Oh! Um. Did you drop your lip balm!
Go where?
Oh, right! I'll get my car.  Hop in!  What?
Oh, where are my manners!?  Alrightie.  Can I help you with that?
There!
Can we go now?
Good.
Can we go now?
Okay.
Alright.
Gotcha.
You're a real piece of work, you know that?
Um. Can you believe all this weather we're having?
Oh, no you don't, Patrick! SpongeBob and I are in the middle of a practice date!!
Excuse me, but how is this supposed to help me with my real date?  Which, by the way begins in five minutes.
SpongeBob! Would you please just shut it and leave me alone?
Don't "um, Squidward" me, you, you annoying, insignificant, waste of my time!
Don't interrupt me! And don't call me, look at me, write me, or even think of me! Cause you and I, we are not friends! And never will be.
Um, you just saw that.
And you probably think I'm a mean, spirited brute, which is the exact opposite of what you were expecting, right?
Huh?
SpongeBob, I'm dreamy!
Would you two pipe down!
Well, I hope she's not as obnoxious as you.
Oh dear Neptune didn't you hear me-
Well make rock some where else. My house is full of sand.
This is way beyond my property line. Hey Patrick, that oaf makes a better bulldozer than a sister!  Construction humor.
Oh I mean it alright. She's a big buffoon, just like Patrick. Except bigger, and dumber, and bufoonier.
Do you think she looks a little...miffed?
Look what  done?!
Hey you can't do that, that's my window!
Oh no. That is definitely not the spirit Patrick. Your sister is out of control!
You can blecor-decorate until the sea cows come home for all I care, just don't use my property to do it!
But that's from...  my house! That's it! I've had my fill of this thieving brute!
The time for talk is over. now is the time for action!  A rock made of sand by two idiots is no match for one carved from the...  tides of time!
Who cares what you think?! if it's destruction they want, then it's destruction they'll get!
Oh, you mean like this?  Sweeeet destruction!
Where is that idiot SpongeBob, leaving me to do all the cooking? This job stinks!  Eugh. Literally.  Mr. Krabs!  There's something in the kitchen you gotta see!
See for yourself!
Mr. Krabs! There's a strange sound coming from the restroom!
I cannot believe I have to deliver all this junk food myself.  What the-  Oh, thank you.
I don't hear a thing, but something stinks.
Oh, well. Thank you for ask-
Mr. Krabs?  Mr. Krabs!  MR. KRABS!  Your shelf collapsed on me, and I twisted my ankle!
As if working here wasn't bad enough, now I've been injured on the job.
Really? Well, maybe I should give them a call.
Oh, no no no, don't touch me!  SpongeBob, would you mind letting go of my nose?
Ow! [] GET AWAY FROM ME!!! Well, this is it! I'm reporting you to the OWS!
Hmm? Anything?
I could sure use a pillow.
And another one for my foot. Fluff it.
I said, "fluff it."
What?
And also, looks like you'll have to take over for me.
After tea, I'd like a tentacle massage.
Hello, Office Workers Safety Department....
I'm waiting!
Oh, it's gonna be a long full recovery. Time to pop my back barnacles.
I'll be glad to.  I mean, I can live the whole tragic episode, if I must. It was just another day at the Krusty Krab, I was at the register, giving it a nice shine between orders, when something a party bun with 10 seeds, instead of 11. Now I wasn't about to stand by and watch a customer go without all his guaranteed nutrients and  vitamins. So I stung in to action."
"Excuse me, sir.
Thats when I entered the back room get a new bun, and just when I was about to reach one, I heard a slight creek. The chained snapped, and then, wham! I I lay on the floor for nearly six hours crying softly for help.  Help! H-help! Help.  But the worst part was that I didn't get that kind gentleman his new bun.
WHAT?!?
What are you going to do to me?
Oh, no!
Good thing you didn't hire a professional to do that.
Because then you'd only get to repair it once.
Time to get out the dental floss. Ha.
Sounds like a lot of extra work to me.
It'll cost you money.
Coming right up, sir. SpongeBob, I need one Krabby Patty, with extra fries and a medium drink.
SpongeBob, two large, two medium. I hate my job.
Mr. Krabs, I am getting really tired of running back and forth. I find it both exhausting and time consuming.
Oh, wonderful. Peachy. Now how am I suppose to get two SpongeBobs so I can hand them these order tickets here?
Oh it's days like this that make me wish I had gone back to college.
Not that I can hear.
With fries. Got it. We'll have it right out to you sir.
There you are sir. The ketchup is in the b--What? Did somebody order a Krabby Patty?
Nobody huh? Ok, I'll just toss it in the trash.
Welcome to the Krusty Krab Drive Thru. Can I take your order?
Ow! I'm not faking it you know. That really hurts! A lot!
It's for my ear-replacement surgery! We need a real microphone and speaker!
How much?
Now you have to replace it.
The microphone!
No but that pile of tin cans over there is .
Good thing you're around to never notice the obvious!
That's nice. That's interesting.
SpongeBob! Order up!
Hurry SpongeBob! I got 26 more orders!
No no no! Not that window! The other one!
And these ones don't!
Mr. Krabs!
For once, he's right!
If you two don't mind, could you keep it down to a low rumble?
Don't care.
Hey! Hello?! Nitwit, morons.
I will not indulge in anything friendly or otherwise with the likes of you two! Presently, I am heading to enjoy a well-deserved morning nap!
I don't care! Listen up, I will not be woken from my nap again, and if I am, I'm gonna...
Just don't let it happen again! Or else.
Would you two KEEP IT DOWN?!
What's going on here?
Wha-What?
SpongeBob?!
Oh, dear me. I know. I hope I never forget this moment.
You're sentimental about your sweat?
OK, this is getting creepy now.
Officially creeped out now.
It's Squidward.
Open the door, nitwit!
You can certainly help...  Why are you wearing garbage?
Dress? It is not a dress, it's a nightshirt. If you don't get rid of this trash, I'm calling the sanitation police.
Touching. Still creepy, but touching. Time to make a phone call.
Thank goodness you're here, officer.
No, it's not my home! It belongs to that filthy little dirtbag!
Thank you again, officers.
Sorry, SpongeBob, the law is the law. We can't just pick and choose which ones we follow.
Really?
My house?!
Ma'am? It's a nightshirt!  This is all your fault! You have to get rid of your junk right now!
You really miss them?
Well, maybe you can take photos of all your junk... uh, friends before you toss them away.
Creepy.
Oh, good grief.
Well, now that you completely ruined my day, once again, I'm going back to bed.
Idiot.  What the...?! SpongeBob, why is my house filled with photos of your dumb junk?
IT'S A NIGHTSHIRT!!
SpongeBob!
Yes, Your Highness.  SpongeBob!
Sponge-  Bob...
No way.
Please SpongeBob, no tricks.
SpongeBob!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
SpongeBob!
SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
No. We are not having a slumber party!
Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Hello, people of Bikini Bottom! I'm glad I'm finally talking to my fans on  television!
Those dimwits don't stand a chance against my imported worm.  Hey! What's the big idea?!
I don't have time for this!  Tea time. Of all the ridiculous concepts![walks onto ice, and slips, the ice cracks, and Squidward falls in, losing his winter clothes, and floats back up in a block of ice, with a shocked face]
No! Singing!
Alright, alright! Someone get me a blanket.
Huh? This isn't mine...  Waaaahhh!
Oh... not again...
Aaah. What? You're burning the sleigh? Are you aware that's our mode of transportation?
We's might have actually a chance of getting back if we had a sleigh.
Wait what?!
Would you two mind stopping with your baby games!? Didn't anybody tell you it's the break of dawn!?
When are you two gonna grow up?
And everybody knows that grown-ups never play with kids! And on that note, I would like to personally commend the sea star for taking his first baby steps into the adult world! Facial hair is a good start I suppose.
Show you?
I know I'm going to regret this... Alright! I will take on this mission!
In the hopes that a quiet, grown-up neighborhood will prevail at last. Moving me one step closer to peace and blissy tranquility. A place where I can-
What?
Why in a million years will I let you tag along?
Wow, that actually makes sense. It must be working already!
Okay.
Let me escort you to my place my good sir! We need to start with personal grooming for your grown-up makeover!
We may have to find you clothes as well.
To go along with your new beard which makes you look very distinguished!
Excuse me! Grown-ups do not high-five!
Ahem!
Well played Patrick! Well played...
Patrick! I'm sure you'd rather have some tetrazzini we grown-ups ordered, right?
Indeed...
And my personal favorite piece is  this lovely statue from the Reef-aissance Era-
Boring!?
Yeah... yes I suppose it does...  SpongeBob! Get down from there right now!
Patrick Star, I am very proud of what you did in there! You know that beard is the best thing that has ever happened to you! Well, other than me of course. Heh...
And that's what I told them look I wanted to...
SpongeBob! The only thing that must be done is cutting the cord with you!
Look Mr. BabyPants  it's gladly clear you learned nothing today on how to be mature!
No buts! We are through entertaining your company! Shall we?
You only gone up three stairs!
We are about to enter the pinnacle of grown-up culture here in Bikini Bottom! Also known as: The Famed Bikini Bottom Opera House!
Nothing, let's find our seats.
Certainly
Oh! Oh! It gets even more thrilling from here!
What the?!
Terrible!
Quiet! Hold it! Stop it right there! I am ashamed and disgusted by you people! I mean don't you know what terrible performance when you see it!?
That's what I thought you- No! No! No! I didn't mean it like that! It was-
SpongeBob, why aren't those orders up yet? . SpongeBob, the collective blood sugar around here is dangerously low.  Why are you grilling index cards?
You know, SpongeBob, statistics show that public speaking is the number three cause of stress right behind death and marriage. NOW GET THOSE ORDERS READY!
MUST I DO EVERYTHING MYSELF?  Huh? Stay back! You'll get your patty when it's your turn.
SpongeBob, what is that horrible racket coming from back here?
You wouldn't know what real music is if it came up and hit you in the face.
I don't care! If you want to hear what real music sounds like, then listen to this.  Hey, give it back. I was just reaching my coda.
Fish flute?
None of you simpletons would recognize real musical talent if it came up and kicked you in the face!
None of you know a great musician when you hear him! Not a single one of you! Not evenevenoh, there's nobody there.
Who said that?
Oh, really?
Well, let me tell you something, mister. I know exactly who you are and why you're here.
You will not get me to eat at the Chum Bucket, no matter how big the discount is.
Shameless. You again?
Why, yes, it is, isn't it?
Nope.
Not again.
Are you sure you got the right squid?
Finally, someone actually appreciates my brilliance. I will play for you, my tiny cyclops. I will play such that Neptune himself will hear me upon his very throne... or whatever chair he's sitting on.
Huh, huh? How are you enjoying the music so far?
My very own fan.
I'm so glad you're enjoying the performance.
Want to... sing?
A-one, a-two, a-one, a-two, a-three, a-four.
It's all in the wrist.
Thank you, thank you.
Yes?
It is an unfortunate truth.
That's an understatement.
Oh, I don't work the grill; I work the register.
Nope. Haven't seen a thing.
Oh, don't you see, Sheldon? Thanks to you, I'm getting better and better as a musician.
It's been your constant encouragement that has helped me progress to new musical heights. I'm hitting notes I never even knew existed.
In fact, thanks to you, I'm going to quit my job at the Krusty Krab and become a full-time musician.
Hey!  Come back!
Once again, I hate people.
La da de, la da dum, la da doo. La da dee. Ah, it's a great day for the art world.  Famous art critic Fredrick T. Nitpick will be critiquing my latest masterpiece. I love hearing myself talk.
Don't touch it! And it's not a hat. It's a beret.
Sorry, SpongeBob. Berets are only worn for true artists, like moi.
Yes, i'm an artist! What are you two bubbleheads doing anyway?
So, you've been counterfeiting currency? And what's doorknob number two been up to?
Crafts?  This isn't summer camp. I am a true artiste.
Hate.
Oh, it certainly is! This piece represents my struggle to reveal my genius to a moronic world.  Witness "La Vista Squidward"! Stunning, isn't it?
What? No! No, you can't do that!
No, wait, come back!
Hey!
You can't give that dunderhead the artist hat!
Oh, , selling one lousy piece doesn't make you an artist!
Well, about...Um, um, well, I'll bet he never sells another one of those ridiculous trinkets!
I'll bet he never sells another!
I'll bet
I actually want to go to work today!
Oh, not you again! May I take your order?
One Krabby Patty
Then, what do you want?
Just order already!
Off the menu? Choose something off the menu! We don't serve artistic advice here!
Huh? What?
In case you haven't noticed,  this is not an artist hat!
Beautiful.
Mm-hmm!
Why don't you just concentrate on your patty?
Ha and ha!
"Dear Squidward, come to my house tonight I am having a...  ...latte sipping contest?" This sound too good to be true!
How 'bout the latte sipping?
That will be $6.75 please.
Hallelujah!
And there they go! Two whole days of no work and no SpongeBob! This is almost too good to be true! Nothing can possibly go wrong!
And you just happened to bring that with you... to the Krusty Krab?
What makes you think I have any interest in your delusional adventurism?
Okay, I'm in!
I don't see any signs of ghosts  Nothing here but a bunch of tacky, old furniture, and boring, representational art.  Huh?
Nooooooooooooooooooo!
Oh, great. I wonder what my vision of eternal suffering will be!  Of course!
I guess this is the part where I start screaming.
Welcome to my world.
Everyone's paying with bones.
No, I mean actual bones.
Go away! I've got better things to do than watch grown men prance around in ridiculous outfits.  ...what? Circuit must've blown again.
So sorry to have put such a wrinkle in your plans!
Hmhmhmhm...
Oh, no. No way! Look what that disgusting pest did to my sustainable kelp garden!  He chewed it up, ruined it!
Oh, thank you for eating at The Krusty Krab.  Can I give you a hand with that, SpongeBob?
Kelpy's not for everyone.
Oh, how could this be? Whatever shall I do?
Oh no, I have a ticket. I just don't know what I'll do without you there.  Oh wait, I just realizedI'll be having the greatest time of my life!
Oh yeah. I show you the ticket, and then through some manner of folly, you destroy it!
Oh, the dream is still alive!
Oh, come on! Nothing but a scam.
Ah, so nice to be surrounded by such kindred spirits.
Me? No. Of course not. No.
See all you fellow Kelpheads at the show.
Come on, SpongeBob. SpongeBob's obnoxiousness is ostracizing me from all these other fans. Somehow I gotta give him to slip.
That's it. Hang on, SpongeBob. I need a rest. My throat is parched. I sure wish I knew where one could procure some lemonade.
I said, I wonder where someone could get some lemonade.
It's right behind you SpongeBob!
Oh, no. Dear me. Oh, no. I could not have you wait in that long line, SpongeBob.
Well, okay, if you insist.
See you after the show, Spongee-G.
Ah, "Turquoise Scallop Sun Dance." I just love this tune.
Just grooving to the soothing waves of the Gentle G.
Don't mind if I do groove.
What the? What?
But I dazzle. Oh.
Oh, boy.
Such immaculate music. It's the very voice of Neptune himself.
No I don'tketchup?
Two words, Patrick "get lost."
Oh, no, you don't, Patrick. You stay away from my backstage pa huh?
I'm going to get those passes back even if I have to rip Patrick in half.  What the?
Hey, come back here with those backstage passes.
But our friend just took our
Oh, well, at least we still have our seats.
Yeah, I got a problem. Those are my seats, you numbskull. I'm gonna rant for a while. You're just gonna sit there, aren't ya?  You're not gonna move along. We waited long and hard for this  Tonight's ruined. A complete disaster. And I didn't even meet Kelpy G.
We're in, SpongeBob. Now I'll finally get to meet the incomparable Kelpy G.
"No backstage passes, no entry."
Oh, please, please, let me see him. Please. Please. Please!
But, but, but what if I told you, uh I'm a clarinet player myself.  I call this one, "Ninth Movement, A Kaleidoscope of Stars." Wait. Hold for it.
Hello, Kelpy. It's great to finally meet
This isn't fair. I should be on stage, not SpongeBob. I'm the mega-talent. I'll show you, Kelpy.  But I'm a musician!
20 years of paint-staking care, and my bonsai portrait is almost complete. Oh! Oh, my. What's this?  I missed a spot. Not to worry. You'll be perfect soon, as perfect as me. Hmm...   Oh. Look what I've done.  Oh, no!
What? What? Who said that?
Of..of course.  What...what...what is it?
"Avenge me?"  SpongeBob!
SpongeBob you moron, you ruined my bon  ...sai.
I said what?
Come on, SpongeBob! What's wrong with you!? Get grilling!
Sigh...which is why I keep telling you: Never try anything new, ever! Stick to what you're good at! And stick to it soon!
SpongeBob! Twenty more orders here!
More Patties!
No, I don't!
Would you please get your friend out of my house?
Where is he?
There he is! He's headed straight for my glass menagerie!
Phew...
Of course.
SpongeBob, I spent 6 long months on that painting!
What in the name of Neptune is going on-
What the...?  SpongeBob, do you mind!?
What am I doing!? What are  doing!?
Cala-what?
Go away.
No.
No.  I said  I will not walk to work with yo--!
Okay. And would you like cheese on--
What? Oh, no! Wha--? No-ho, that was not me, I swear.  SpongeBob!  It's empty!  See empty!
Well let's see, maybe 'cause I have a brain.
Oh, really? And do you think that I don't know that this grill is...
Oh, SpongeBob, I got a present for you.
Now now. Calm down. I've should've given this to you a long time ago!
Perhaps my lawyers should explain
And.
Oh if I ignore it, maybe it will go away.
I thought not  Oh-kay Patrick. WHAT? WHAT?! WHAT!
Yeah Patrick! Get back to...WHAT?!? WORK?!? Oh no! NO! NO! NO! Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs! This will not stand!
What?
No.
No!
No! NO! NO! NO! GRR!  Go away Patrick! Go away Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!  Patrick!   Patrick!  Patrick!  Patrick!  Patrick!
Ah...don't mind if I do.  Ah...no better way to spend a break with a little cool jazz.  Huh?
Hello...you...
Ooh...that's great...
Wonderful.
PATRICK!!!
Welcome to the House of Misery. May I take your order...
That depends...
How long you want to live?
Seaberries? I'm allergic to... Seaberries...That's it! I know what I must do!  SpongeBob!
SpongeBob!
NO
Give me that restraining order!
Alright, right, let's look at this.
Quit bellyaching and hand me a pen.
Stop the waterworks! You're not going to jail.
No! I'm releasing you from this order.
...And adding someone who is much more deserving!
No, Patrick! YOU!!
Hark, the odor you seek is before you.
Oh, for dolphins sakes!! Do tell what's troubling you so!
Shocking.
Sounds like you'd better stop bothering me and put on your thinking cap.
That'll keep him out of my hair.  Of course, he actually has one.  To each, his own.
Yes, your freakishness.
Good riddance.  What's this? Something's familiar about those ketchup swirls.  Sweet Neptune! Could that have been...
That's not garbage, it's a Fiasco!
No, no, no, you don't get it! It's the work of Fiasco the artist!  He was featured in last month's Art Wonk magazine!
It all makes sense now! The dark denim, the dismal statements, the extensive use of red and yellow! This is directly out of his early abstract experiments!
This is an authentic Fiasco!
Oh, it's simply not for sale, not even for a million dollars.
It's not yours to sell! I found it!
You tried to throw it away!  It's mine!
Here they are, Officers! These idiots have been causing a ruckus. Interrupting my beauty sleep.
But what do you mean 'all'? I'm not under arrest! I..I..I..uhh.. These are idiots! They're causing a ruckus! I..I want sleep!
Hey, don't I get a phone call?
One Krabby Patty, extra grease.
Mmm.
GRR...
All right, let me see it.  The Krusty Krab work schedule, what's so great about this?
Hmmm...  Oops, I accidentally burned up your memories.
Ummm, let me think...    I guess I don't have a happiest memory. Oh, well.
Yes?!
So what?
I hear you crying all the time.
Look, I don't need a happy memory, so just get back to your culinary grease factory and leave me alone.
You're right, SpongeBob, I don't have a happy memory. This is horrible.
Really? Do you think you can?
Well, it's against my better judgement, but, okay.
Mmm hmm.
Hey, this isn't so bad. I think I actually feel kinda...happy!
This is not my happiest memory...
Why are we at the Art Museum?
Great... I get to see all the art of people who have succeeded where I've failed. My art will never be shown in this...   What the? This... this is my sculpture! How did it get here?
Gosh! I can't believe it! I think this might be it!
Yeah!
Gosh! Fiasco himself is talking about my art!
And now he's melted it... Not a happiest memory...
What view?
Very nice... except that I'm AFRAID OF HEIGHTS!
Wait! No!  Oh boy...  Oh yeah...nice view...
Uh oh...
Time to face facts. I'll never have a happiest memory.  And if I do, it definitely won't involve you.  Hello misery... I'm home...  I might as well go to bed for a hundred years or so.  Wake me when I'm dead...
I just can't seem to get happy...  Well, that didn't help...  Huh? That's strange, I could have swear I just threw that darn phone away.  Oh yeah. My fax machine. Now, why did I buy that again?
Yes...  Thanks for stopping by.
I can't seem to get happy...  Maybe this will help.  Nope... I guess not...  Oh great... I wonder who that could be...  You're not SpongeBob.
"Tentacles". Yes that's me.
Thanks...  Doesn't say who's it from. No doubt SpongeBob is hiding inside. Ah well, here goes nothing.  GOTCHA! Huh?  It's empty. Empty, just like my miserable life!  I see nothing but darkness ahead...  SpongeBob!?
You don't seem to understand.  I... don't... WANT... A... HAPPIEST MEMORY!
I feel WONDERFUL!  This is it, my happiest memory!
I can't feel my legs.
I quit!
It's The Big One! It's the end of the world! Invest in gold! Hoard your drinking wa... I should've known.  What's going on in here?!
Lend a hand? No!
Ow
Against my will, I might add.
Ah! I'm unraveling!  If you ever, and I mean ever-  Ow! My neck. I'm gonna be in the chiropractor's for a week.
Huh?
My order?
So, I'm fired? No more taking orders?  No more interacting with customers? No more SpongeBob!? I'm free! Ha Ha! I'm free!  Whoo.
Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order, beep, beep?
Oh, well I wouldn't do to have my face in a toilet right now.
SpongeBob!  Why don't you mop your way over the kitchen.  We need another Krabby Patty.
Best day at work ever!
: Would You Mind?!
I don't wanna make faces I want to sleep! D-de-de-de-Da!
Let's try a new game. Let's combine whatever you get out of whatever this is you're doing with the quiet of sleep!
Whatever works.
: Let's go SpongeBob, the orders are pouring out.
: Come on SpongeBob! Chop, Chop!
: You deliver it, I'm on break.
- What is the hold up in here?
- Face Freeze! I thought that was a myth. ha! Krabs too! ha ha ha!! (Begins laughing hard) This is rich!Ha ha ha! Oh. Hey, my face. Ah my face! Oh, great, look at what you've done.
HEY, IT'S NOT FUNNY! STOP LAUGHING!
Ah, time to relax.
Well, time to go.
Now what?
Yeah, so what?
What's the big deal? It's only garbage?
...garbage.
Right!
Yes, by all means, take it.  Hello?
Yes! For the final time, I don't want that paper. It's yours forever and ever!
Get out!
Get out!
Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg, and plead, and cry, don't give that paper back to me...ever!
SpongeBob...  What in the world are you giggling about?
How can anyone have fun with just a piece of paper?  Ohh...what can he possibly be doing with that paper?!
Super-moron's more like it.
Oh, boy.
Do a big yellow idiot with a stupid piece of paper.  How did he do that?
Hey, that little paper does seem like fun.  What am I saying?! I am such an idiot.  SpongeBob, honestly, and his dumb paper. He calls that fun?  Now, reading 'Boring Science Digest,' that's fun.  Erosion.  Mitosis.  See, I can have fun taking a bath.  Painting fruit, there's nothing more fun than painting fruit. This is more fun than anything.  I'll prove to him that paper is not fun!  I'm having fun, la-la-la...
Hey, SpongeBob, top this one.  Hey, Little Squidward, what's gray and ugly and has six arms?
What did you...
Haha, I'm having so much fun with my new shell-cart. Ah-haha. Hey, SpongeBob, can your stupid paper do this?
Well, you can't play music with a piece of paper!
What? I didn't play any wrong notes.
Give me my paper back! Now let go of it. I said let go of it!  Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go...
What do you mean you can't?
I never said anything like that!
Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me ever!
No, I don't wanna see it again! Just give me that paper.
Wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something.  Yeah-yeah, something, something...  A-ha, wait up, SpongeBob! Wait! Hold on there, chum.  I'm going to make you an offer.
Not the lint, the rubber band!
Oh, dare, dare!
Listen, you!  You are not going anywhere until we strike a deal.  Gotta get that paper.
Trade...
Everything must go! Well, that's the last of it.  I've given you everything but the shirt off my back.
Okay, the shirt!  Take it! Take my shirt!
You can have all that junk, 'cause now I've got this! I've got the paper, and you've got my useless garbage.  I got it! Haha and you can't have it.  I got it, you're a sucker. You're a sucker, sucker!  At last, what should we try first, Mr. Paper? Impressions! A guy with a piece of paper on his nose.  Look at me! I'm a guy with a piece of paper...on his...nose. Hmmm. A-ha! Wait, wait, wait, wait...  Tada!
Okay, okay, uhh, helicopter!  Gentlemen, start your engines. I'm flying! Oh yeah, I'm flying! I'm flying! That's right, that's right, here we go now.  I'm flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying...  ...flying.  Wait, more impressions. A guy throwing a piece of paper on the ground!  A guy stomping on the piece of paper  I'm a guy who traded everything he owns for a...
Does anybody have any sunscreen?
My, what a beautiful day it is outside.  Too bad I'm cooped up here in the Krusty Krab.
Just where I always seem to be on a nice sunny day.
Worse? How?
Sick? Is that really a "worse"?
Oh, really.
Huh? Oh, SpongeBob. I'm suddenly not feeling very well.
Uh, well. Let's see. Uh. I got a scratchy throat and, uh,  dry mouth, and my, uh, eyes are itchy.
I'm not sure. But I feel I might be coming down with a dreaded illness.
Name? Oh, uh. Per, swees, swer, square, uh, squid's disease.
Squid's disease.
Squid's disease!
SpongeBob? SpongeBob.  What are you doing back there?
Well, SpongeBob. I think you're probably right.
Well, I, I better go break the news to Mr. Krabs.
The what?
Ow!
Wonderful.
But Mr. Krabs...
But I...
But...
But the customers. You don't want them to get sick, do you?
SpongeBob, would you bring that order to table 3, please.
SpongeBob.  Turn around, please.
And just what is that supposed to be?
Not that. The thing on your face.
Yes.
Hiiii, SpoooongeBooooob.
Could I see that?
Because I find this all so very inte...  ...resting.
Oh, of course. It's not like I'm busy working or anything.
And you're telling me this, why?
So, you're telling me to go home?
Yippee! Thank you, Mr. Krabs! I mean
Who thought that having an illness could feel so good?
Oh, no. What happened to you?
Well, so much for enjoying the great outdoors. But at least I can relax and enjoy  some afternoon tea.
SpongeBob, what have I told you about coming into my house?
Oh yeah howdy. That's too bad it had to end. Finally.
Oh would you look at that. I'm suddenly feeling much better. I think I'm going back to work now, bye.
Please just stop. Stop following me.
Let the madness begin.
SpongeBob!  Thanks?
Here, I'll change the channel.
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Agent, sir. While we're waiting, perhaps I could direct your attention to-- oh, the many code violations you'll find  if you turn this way. It's a death trap.
Stringing lights so Santa knows, in no uncertain terms...toGO AWAY!!!
I'm not home!
Why don't you go bother Sandy?
I said I'm not home!  SpongeBob, give me back my door!
I beg to differ.I mean, justlook at this place!  It's disgusting, not to mention our cheap boss!
Anything for my fans.
What's seems to be the problem? Well, well, well,  if it isn't Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob. Now just follow me. I believe I have a table reserved just for you.  Bon Appetit, Suckers!  See you in two years!
One at a time, please.
Yes, isn't it?  Next? Whoa!  Plankton!
Are you not seeing the line of people out there?! What's the hold-up with the new batch of Fricassee?!
I don't care if it isn't finished! Just take the orders!
Here you go, folks. Enjoy my world famous Fricassee.  Grandma!
What are you doing here?
Ow! I didn't do it! Uh, uh, it was him!
Ok, I admit it! I admit it! Butbut what's the big deal?  Ow!
My fan base!()
Ow!
No!  Living the dream! ()
What?
Don't know, don't care.
Present!
I try not to look directly at the customers.
Will we got overtime pay?
Oh, sure thing, Mr. Krabs! I'll get right on that, never.
It's about time! Where have you been? I'm outta here!
Oh yeah, I'm definitelygonna do this.
Whoo... priceless.
Maybe I'll...practice my clarinet.
Ah-he-he-hem.
GAH!!! DAH! DAH! DAH!
The day I willingly practice my musical art with you is the day I grow hair on my...
And who might you be?
Are you serious? Is this a dream?
Yes he said money, but more importantly he said faaaannnnnnssss!!! And not the type that blows air if you're feeling too hot! The type that wants autographs on everything they got!
Uh, excuse me? Is there anyway I get to do this tour as a soloist?
A dream wrapped in pain. I don't know whether to smile or pout.
Sounds like a load of hooey...
We're performing at a supermarket!? Driver, turn this bus around! The tour is canceled! Head straight back to the Krusty Krab!
What!?
It's not even my restaurant and somehow I regret that decision...
A one! And a two! And a one, two, three, four!  Thank you! Thank you very much!  Oh come on! Nothing!?
You're kidding me, right!? We're performing at a retirement home!?
Oh yeah...they got one foot in the rave. Heh heh...reaper jerks!
Two, three, four!  Two, three, four!
Ok, two, three, four...
Supermarket openings, retirement homes! What's next a child's birthday party!  This is our WORSE gig yet: Children parties! Well if this is the way this tour is being organized, then I would like to...OOOOOOOOW!!!!  I AM NOT DONKEY-FISH!!!
Mr. Krabs, how much farther is it to the next town?
Well if this concert is anywhere near terrible as the other ones, then it's gonna be my last!  What the...Electronics Outhouse!? Good bye!
Well then, where is it!?
Hold it! This better not be one of your tricks Mr. Krabs!
Yeah...I've never thought I get to perform for so many fans!
Isn't that...what you were talking about?  Ah...just soak on in Squidy old boy! Pretty invigorating isn't it? Wait a minute...why are they chanting "Ned and the Needlefish?"
Wait! I know what you came here for!  Well?
Uh oh...
In fact, they're still going wild...
Well, that wasn't a complete waste of time...Oh no wait, it was...
What do you mean you can't?
No no! Wait! Let me guess: You ate the spare tire?
Mr. Krabs, I'd like some money for cab fair.
But nothing. I'm going home. Now put some cash in my hands so I...
Forget it! I'll just walk!
I could care less what the Krusty Krab needs!  Now get out of my way!  Ow! Ow! OOOOWWWW!!! Ow...
Get your hands off me!  OWWWW!!!!
Don't...
How did I not see this plan was a failure from the start? Being around SpongeBob is bad for my heart! And that's not even the worse part! Supermarkets, retirement homes, birthday parties for kids! My career in music really feels like it has hit the skids! I give up! There is no point! I give up! Mr. Krabs will have to go bankrupt while I'm busy, bittering giving up!
It's getting really cold out here and I'm four hundred miles from home it will appear! And my feet are hurting oh dear I fear this tentacle-itis is pretty severe!
I should probably give up! On this giving up today! This is the part I turn around and play!
Wow! That was actually, kinda good!
Well it looks like they could help you figure it out...
It's quitting time, SpongeBob. Go home.  Quitting time!  GO HOME!
Where?
Oh, forget the name. Look at the ridiculous outfit. What is that? A pair of briefs?
Barnacles!
Question. Are you two acting more infantile than normal?
Just as the essential oils were kicking in.  Hey! I'd appreciate some peace and quiet.  How dare you scoot away from me. I'm scolding here.  Would you two for once act your age!  Fine! Act like infanture hold-ups. See if I care. I'm returning to my grown up lifestyle. So keep it down!
What the? Where am I? What's going on?
Of course I'm grown up! Why wouldn't I be?!  Am I wearing a diaper?
Is it full?
Stop! Not another word about this! Ever!
Ahhh, yes, just how I like it......nice and empty.
Oh, yes, sirreenice and empty.
Welcome to the Krusty--  Well, there goes my nap. Multiple orders up! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! Where are you! You need to get out here and make those Krabby Patties.  SPONGEBOB!!!  Get it together, SpongeBob. The dining room is full of ravenous customers.
Hmm, what was that imbecile doing in there?  An old book?
What's going on here?
Nothing ever happens in this dump...
Why did I say that?
Krusty Krab!
What!?
What are you screaming about!?
I'm on it.
I think I'm gonna be sick!
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no no no no no no!  Yes! Oh, my prized spiny succulent! Thank Neptune you're safe!
Enough's enough!  It's time to end this madness! Let's put this freak show on ice!
Phew...
What kind of unforeseen yet completely predictable stupidity have you ruined my day with this time?
Paranoid much?
Well... no. I have more important things to do.
I won't. Uh... hello? Is somebody there? Um... hello? It's considered rude not to answer! Hah... whatta ya got? Cotton in your earholes? I gotta get outta here!SPONGEBOB!
SpongeBob! SpongeBob! Open up!
Hurry SpongeBob!
You were rrrright!
About the danger that lurks around every corner!
SpongeBob, this is serious! I was just viciously attacked!
You gotta teach me SpongeBob! Teach me the way! The way of tarake.
Um... sure. Whatever.
Can't we just get on with this SpongeBob?
Sigh... I mean can't get just get on with this "O Great Sensei?"
Uh huh. What else you got?
That's it!? THAT'S the "totality" of your karate mastery?
Oh boy...
-Alright already! We've been through this! Are you going to teach me how to get revenge on my attacker or what!?
Yeah, fine.
Oh...whatever. Hiyah...
"I promise not to use karate only for protection and not for revenge." Or whatever...
A board? I wasn't attacked by a piece of wood! I was assaulted by a deranged lunatic!
Sigh...whatever you say Sensei...
I'm sure I can break one little twig! Hiiii-YAH!.
Arg! This is stupid! The only thing this manic threw at me were his big, meaty fists!
Dimwits luck!
Alright...  HIYAH! This isn't working! My assailant was twice as tall! And shoulders were twenty times as broad! The burrows of his brow with the size as biceps!
Groceries? You'll have to pull my groceries from my cold, wet tentacles bucko! Take this! Hiyah!Huh? Think that's going to stop me!? You're not getting me without a fight! HIYAH!Got you... right where...I want you! Vengeance... is... MINE!
Sandy! Wait! I need you to teach... Sigh... this is pointless. I'll never be able to protect myself. I may as well start handing my groceries to criminals. Here! Please Mr. Criminal! Take my unprocessed kelp feed!
Please Sandy! I'll do anything!
Phew! All finished!
Shut up! Phew!
That's it! I am outta here! This is a no good waste of my time!Hey! I'm doing it! I'm blocking the acorns!
Hah hah! I can't believe I did it!
Okay! Okay! Hee-YAH!Hah hah hah! Oh, I did it! Hee-YAH! I can protect my groceries now! Hee-YAH! I am a karate master! WOO HOO HOO!
Yeah yeah, that's great, thanks. But I have some business to attend to!Heh heh heh... What's this? Do I find myself on this dark and scary street, yet again? We'll just see what happens! This time!
Let me give him a taste! A mere morsel of what's in store!  Hee-YAH!  HEE-YAH!Hiyah! That one was called Washing Sandy's Windows! Stay back or you're gonna get it! I am warning you! Okay buddy, I warned ya! I like to call this one Taking Out Sandy's Trash! Hee-YAH!
Hah! Hah! How do you like them apples? YAH!
Hah! Feel my wrath! How's your uncle!
My finishing move! I give you Watering Sandy's Lawn! Hee-YAH!
Uh, oh.
Whatever! I'm still a karate master!
Yes I am!
And what is that suppose to mean?
Okay already! I get it! What? Wait a second! Am I under arrest?
And don't forget these.
SpongeBob!
I don't care if you were. The customers are about the snap!
Stay back, you ravenous brutes. Oh!
Ah, a beautiful day beachside. I couldn't think of a thing that could ruin this.
Hey, you're blocking my light.  SpongeBob.
I don't know and I don't care!  Hold it!  What I want to know is why you two have ruined my attempts of having an even tan!
You idiots!  That goo is dangerous! Weren't you two morons listening?
Toupe? You mean hair?  How do I look?
Thanks, goo!
Sheesh, you'd think the sky was falling.  I am going to learn to keep my big mouth shut.
Would you pipe down!?
That's nice...and...interesting...
Ha! You two won't sleep a wink tonight if you see that movie.
Boo.
I told those muttonheads not tosee that movie. [walks into his house]
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. SpongeBob! Get up! He's here!
Ha Ha Ha Ha. This is the most perfect. What a couple of hopeless babies. I really should stop. But Im having too much fun. (goes in SpongeBob's house) Ha. It's almost too easy.
There's just no sport in it.
How cheesy. Who would ever be frightened by that?
Hey! MoistBob DripPants, you mind?
Well, try to contain yourself. We have a customer.
Charming colloquialism, but let's try something that's actually on the menu.
Hah hah hah. Well, that's a first for you. An unsatisfied customer.
Keep that up and you'll lose consciousness. Tentacles crossed.
What is your problem?
Remind me again, is that good news or bad news?
Minding it for  which customer?
SpongeBob's got that covered.
I was busy, trying to forget about this place 'till you woke me up.
Nice working conditions, but, no thanks!
Oh, a restaurant employee handling chewed bubble gum? That's gotta violate a lot of health codes.
Sorry, all out of polish.
It doesn't matter what you "want" me to do, I won't do it!
Ludicrous.
Whatever.
You sure it's not  you're smelling?
Oh, come on, SpongeBob. Krabs' Yeti story is a complete and total crock!
You can believe in whatever garbage you want to. Just do it away from me. Now, run along and wash Krabs' undies.
What? What? What? Wha... huh?
Of course, he is. Nice costume, Eugene. Couldn't you at least have it dry-cleaned or pressed?  Didn't brush this morning. Did we?
Oh, yes I am.
I almost feel sorry for the little nimrod.  What the? Do you mind?
Oh, I hope you're happy, Mr. Krabs! You're driving him insane!  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll eat me if I'm lazy. Whatever.  Not the home and garden section! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob, we have no customers today! Ergo, we have nothing to do! No matter what that buffoon wants you to think!
Have you lost it, SpongeBob?!
Guess I'm down to the comic section.
That does it!  I have had it with this ridiculous ruse!  Using fear to prey on a feeble mind!  Even SpongeBob doesn't deserve that!  Enjoy spooking the witness, eh Krabs? Well, we'll just see how you like it.  Roar! See? I can dress up as a convincing Yeti Krab too!
Take off that phony suit, Mr. Krabs! You're not fooling anybody!
Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I'm a little busy trying to pull off this stupid mask of yours.
What?
You mean the sound of my own flesh sizzling to a crisp?
No.
No.
Nuh-uh.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
Hmm? Who's that?
Fired?
Hey, what about me? Can I get fired too?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, that's enough. It's closing time.  You know, it just won't be the same around here without you. You'll have to visit sometime...  As a customer.  Buh-bye now. Sayonara. Good riddance.  Man, is it gonna be sweet without that pest around!  This day couldn't get any better.  Well, Eugene, let me commend you on a terrific business decision. But now that SpongeBob's gone, who will be running the grill?
I can smell the grease fires already.
How many times do I have to tell you... Keep..  Off...  My... ... Petunias?!
I'm afraid so.  SpongeBob...
You know I hate you, right?
Well, I hate the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more.  Please come back and be the fry cook again.
Hmm.  Not exactly my color.
20 minutes in the bath seems like enough.   Another day!  Another day.
Whatever.
I wasn't waiting.
Yes, I saw that.
Late? We're gonna be there fifteen minutes early!
SpongeBob, look.  We're walking in a straight line.
A straight line is the shortest distance between any two points!
Well, see, you have point A , where you start, and then there's point...  point... I don't even know what I'm talking about!
Oh, for the last time  straight line, point A, there's no shortcut!
What moron told you that?
Huh.
Look, the Krusty Krab is right at the end of the block!
No, SpongeBob. I'm just going to struggle through the rest of this walk, alone.
Straight line, point A to point B. You're still not getting it.
Ahhhh....
No thanks, I got one!  Perfect. No customers. No SpongeBob.
Krusty Krab. May I reluctantly help you?
You don't say. How's that shortcutting going?
Congratulations.
What?! He gets to go home and take a bubble bath?! That's my thing!
I'm as neat as a pin? I'll show you neat as a pin!  Where's my bubble bath, Mr. Krabs?!
I couldn't find a smelling salt, so I just used table salt.
What do you think? SpongeBob's in one of his moods. He failed his boating exam...again.
None taken.
Let me grab a pencil.  Ha, it's funny, cause I mean the opposite. Ha.
Okay.
Would you like fries with that?
You missed one.
Huh?
I'm busy.
Fourteen!
It is!
What's "busy busy?"
No no no no no! Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Don't tell me anything, don't even tell me what you're doing here!
I SAID NOT TO TELL ME!  You're ruining my perfect afternoon. I'm spending some quality time with someone who's very important to me.
Perfectly brown toast points.  Sparkling kelp juice.  Here's to me!  D'oh! That simpering buffoon!
I know.
GO AWAY!!!
Wait. I thought you were some other idiot.
"You are cordially invited to the fanciest and shmansiest artistic event of the season: The opening of Galleria Diphtheria." Oh, I've heard of that! "Bikini Bottom's most exclusive fine arts showcase. This invitation guarantees the admittance of Squidward Tentacles--" "--Squidward Tentacles...""...'Ploos Oh-nay.'"
Ahh! What are you still doing here?
Plus one! Oh yeah, of course! Plus one!  Sure!  What's a plus one?
Do you have to do it?
What? Do you want me to call your supervisor and tell him you're just standing around?
No, not like you!
Let's see here. Friends...
Friends, friends...
Hm. Yeah, I wonder if I still have my receipt for this thing. No big deal. Anybody can make a friend by...  TONIGHT?!  Let's see. There must be someone who's a real part of your life, Squidward. Who do you see every single day? Who do you know like the back of your suction cups?
But, of course! It's so simple.
SpongeBob, I have something to ask you.
That wasn't the question. Which way did the mailman go?
Hey, there you are!
What? What are you... Oh!  You always were a big kidder, huh?  Mailman  guy?
I love introverts! Why I'm an introvert!
Say, I bet we have a lot in common.
That's me!
Oh, delicious food is my favorite kind of food! Especially when that delicious food is something you can...
Once you've had pointed toast, you just never want any other kind.
SpongeBob!
Yeah, I know it... What?
Oh, you think you know a guy?  Oh, who are you kidding? It's not in the cards for you. I bet not even this old tin can would be my friend.
Who is this?
SpongeBob!
I need to ask you something important.
Will you tell Larry I wanna talk to him?
Well, it's, uh, kind of hard to put into words.
You have?
Um, no. The.. They always seemed a little sporty for me.
What the heck?
We make quite a team!
You know, earlier today I met a jerk who said he didn't like clarinet music.
You know, you're alright, Lester.
Whatever. The point is do you want to go with me to a gallery opening tonight?
What?! You don't need that glop!
Oh, come on. It's a fat. You don't wanna be one of those mindless rubes who marches around in a constant haze of stupidity. "I love protein shakes. I'm the most gullible rube on the planet. Duh! Duh! Duh! Give me my stupid protein shake."
I mean...
So, are we still on for tonight? Sevenish?
I guess it's just you and me again.
What are you doing here?
No.
Just get me out of here!
Thanks.
Friend?
Would you be my plus one?
Come on, SpongeBob.
Aww!
: Oh, yeah. They're a riot. What can I get ya?
: Ah, the executive treatment.
: Well, that's what Mr. Krabs makes me call it. It's really just a Krabby Patty that costs more. And SpongeBob wears a different tie when he makes it.
: Oh, I'm sorry sir. The executive treatment is available to executives only. I'm not sorry.
:  First of all a lot of that donut, it's still on your face!
: I told you, it's for executives only! And you aren't even dressed like an executive! I could of course sell you  the official Krusty Krab business tie for only 10 dollars.
: Not on its own, no. But you could Krabby-size the tie with and get a pair of business glasses for additional 10 dollars.
: Well, you're half right.
: Here's your glasses.
:  Here you go.
:  I'll save it alright. I'll just put it here in the circular files.
Oh, what now? Too much weeing. What is...
PICKLE JUICE! Oh, my eye!
Yeah. Probably my eye.
You missed a spot.
What's going on in here?
This is the greatest company picnic ever?
Is this toilet paper we're sitting on?
Well, I guess things will pick up once the food gets here.
What?
I'm going home.
Do not say it!
Don't!
Well, this is more like it. You've been holding out on us, Mr. Krabs. You old devil.
Delicacies?
One side, Goopy!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
I have to say, Mr. Plankton. If this is how you treat your employees...
I was riding that? What about those delicacies I was eating?
You mean the guy who's been nursing a single fry for the last hour?
Grr!  Excuse me, sir. But you seem to be having trouble masticating. Here let me help you.  What? No tip? Finally! Yes!  Leaving early! I can't believe this is finally happening!  Cause it's not.
I don't want any hair on my chest.
Wait, you were transporting suntan lotion?  What SPF?
What are we all winking about?
I would, but what's the point? There's no one to make the food.
Let me think. No idea.
I can't do that!
Alright, alright! Calm down, everybody! I'm here to take your order!
I can't believe that I had to do my job's and SpongeBob's.
What the?  Oh, it's not a cold, it's my allergies.
Hey, lady!
SpongeBob, is that you?
What happened to you? And where did all these snails come from?!
I'm not worried about them, I'm worried about me! I'm allergic to snails!
One snail I can handle. Maybe even two or three. But this? Geesh, no way! Just how many snails do you have?
Enough! You have to get rid of those snails and get back to work!
That's it!! I'm calling the Bikini Bottom officials so they can deal with it!
He said like two hundred and fifty-eight! Well, do something about it! That's why I pay taxes!  Oh, my allergies are killing me.
Oh, chill your gills! I'll get your food, dude!
That's it. I'm done.
Don't worry, it's not a problem! Any idiot can do it, right?
He said, "No, thank you, please"? What does that even mean? I demand that you do something about those snails, now!
Oh, this has got to stop!
Oh, quit messin' around and just break down the gate!
A little higher. A little to the left. A little more to the left. Ha- Perfect!  Oww.
No he doesn't!
This is the day he gets the patty orders for the big Founder's Day eating contest, it's the most money Krabs makes all year.
Wonder no longer, you only need one.
Didn't you see today's newspaper?
He's the current champion. He only needs to eat one patty to win.
Oh, let me think. That sounds so no!
What? Do you think that games grow on trees?
No, you ninny! Somebody makes them.
Yeah. Somebody thinks up the game, then they make the game.
No, you couldn't. You would be incapable.
Your operative word there is think.
Double morons.
Whoopee. Do tell.
Uh-huh.
I know I'm gonna hate myself for saying this, but what have you got?
O?
Tic-Tac.
Tic and Tac.
Butterin' than the different game?
I don't see the point to this game night. Every game that Patrick has "invented" is more pointless and boring than the last.
Well, if it's started, then I'm already bored.
Yeah. In crayon.
More like a lamatourium. Ha.
Are we finished? Who won?
Might I suggest "garbage"?  What?
Could we just get started already? I'm late for my coma.
Look, Patrick! You go, then Sandy, then SpongeBob, then me! Okay?
Both!
I've got a great idea. Why don't we just start rolling and you can explain the game as we play.
Could you give me the dice? Give me the dice? Because it's my turn!
Uh-huh.
Oh, good thing you've landed on snacks. You must be famished.
Well, what do I do to get out of jail?
Well, if the only way to get out of jail is to roll a six! And I can't roll if I'm in jail! Just how am I supposed to get out of jail?! Grrr!
Fine. Someone say my name.
What? Wait! No! But I don't have a finbone! I'm an octopus!
Oh, this game doesn't make any sense!
Well, neither have you.
That's it! I've had enough!
Huh? Oh. Hmm...
Race the car.
Race the car!
Oh boy! Snacks!
But I was on snacks!
Could someone please tell me what we are supposed to be doing? What's the point? This entire game is completely random! It jumps from one thing to another! I don't know how you are supposed to win! And Patrick seems to be making up the rules as he goes along!
Okay, I'm going outside.
But I didn't say "outsidies" I said...
Ha.
Oh, I get the rules alright! The rules are that it doesn't matter what anybody rolls! You can just make up whatever it means!  So, I could just roll the dice and say, "Automatic Winner!"
Huh? Oh, you know what, you're right. That was a good play.
You did it again. You made up another rule! This game is the worst! Stupid game!
Anything to get out of this game! Thanks, Officers!
Somebody say my name!
Oh, Teddy. You're my favorite snuggle buddy.
Well, why don't you clean the... uh...
We can always clean the... uh...
Why don't you clean your own... uh...
Alright, alright. Umm... Ring everything one more time.
Two more times.
Ah, but did you clean down to the subatomic particles?
I don't know. Why don't you just, I don't know, see how many things you can flush down the toilet.
Are you questioning my orders?
Ahh!! What have I done?!
This is a completely irresponsible thing to do!  But I must admit, it looks amazing!
And try this!
Here they go!
That was funny. It almost looked like Mr. Krabs' safe. You know. The one with the secret Krabby Patty formula inside?
How could you?
I didn't say the safe!
Well, I order you to go get it!!!
What have I done? I flushed SpongeBob down a toilet. Why that's despicable. Even for me.
Alright! As soon as I get the frycook out of the toilet, you can all have your krabby patties!
Eew!! Yuck. It's so unsanitary. Can't believe I'm doing this.
SpongeBob! Are you down here?
Do not touch me! I am way out of my comfort zone!
Alright, you've been down here longer than me. Which way?
Figures.
Look like snakes.
We need to get up there!
There it is!
Darn it! I missed again!
AHH!!! Leapin' lampreys! They're biting me!
Ahh! Ahh! My eyes!
Where? Where?
Silencio.
What the?
In here!
Why is the diagram shaped like a giant sewer snake with an arrow point to its stomach?
What are you doing?!
Oh. That makes sense.
Snake food!
Don't bother me while I'm hysterical!
I'm alive? I'm alive!
Just my luck.
Hey, everybody. The cook's back from the toilet.
But Mr. Krabs? Why?
Nothing, there is never a sale.
There's no senior discount!
What?!
Where's he going?
SHH! Some people are trying to enjoy le cinema.
Nobody does, it's art, now sit down!
WHAT?!
PLEASE SIT DOWN!
SpongeBob!
What are you... Whoa! You've been working out.
Yes! Anything you meathead! Just go before you destroy the place!
Well, that was the last customer, SpongeBob.
And you know why it was a great day? Because Krabs never even showed up.
Oh my sea stars! Free ice cream!
One free ice cream, please?
Huh? I just got my slippers on!
One free cone, please?
For the love of Pete!
Ah-ha!
I want my free...
What is going on?
I know it's a stupid question but is there any ice cream left?
You ate it all! You animals! You didn't even leave me one drop?!  There's gotta be some left in here!
Come on! Get in my mouth! No, this one's empty!
Oh, SpongeBob, do you have one of your precious thumbs-up for me? I would just love to get one.
Oh. That's...thank you. I think.
Uh, let me give you a hand. My thumbs work.
SpongeBob, what are you doing here?
What are you talking about, jellyfish for brains! We are a troupe.
A dance troupe, you numb-skull! This is a dance showdown. No one is going to fight!
Oh brother.
Will you stop yapping already.
What rec center.
I didn't win anything.
Whatever. []
I said "Whatever."  Wait, didn't I just... Didn't I...[]
There's only one explanation. I'm still in my bed and I'm having a nightmare! [] Wake up! (x3) []
Two, as in Two SpongeBobs? Sure, this is all just a bad dream, right? I'm dreaming and you're in my dream!
If this is a dream. there are no consequences. I can do anything! [] I really am dreaming! []
Yup. I'm still dreaming [] Hello, there. Are you enjoying my dream?  I heard you like your patties "Ground" []
Isn't it obvious, you red faced tightwad? I'm dreaming! [] What's that under there?
That's right. [] I don't care (x2) none of this is real. Hmm, I always wanted to fly and since this is my dream, I'm going to fly! []
Gaining speed, increasing thrust, raising nose, air pressure on tentacles, stray tables in right position, and liftoff!
Hm? Huh, how strange. Usually I wake up each morning with a dark feeling of dread gnawing at my stomach. But today, I feel positively...happy!  Smilin' rainbows, smilin' sun, smilin' rocks, and vegetation! Look ma, I'm dancing, and hear my song! The world is lovely when nothing is wrong! Everything's smiling, yes even me! Is this what they call feeling happy?!
Good morning, SpongeBob!  Oh,  why I felt great this morning, there was no SpongeBob.
Oh, what did you numbskulls do with the trash?
What the -- why?
Oh, why didn't you just use the money that Nick Fishkins gave you to rent a room or buy a new home?
Ohhh...let me get this straight. You saw a TV commercial of Nick Fishkins saying he would buy your home and without meeting him or signing anything, you believe your homes have been sold? Now doesn't that seem weird, even to you?
Oh, listen you dumb--  Uh, you know, looks like you guys got Fishkinned, and well, there's nothing you can do about that!
Ah, work is done!  Now I can go home to a SpongeBob-free zone and rearrange my doily collection!
Uh, no, no, you don't wanna do that!
Well, a family has moved in there, with a lot of kids, and they don't like to be disturbed.
Oh, like, pfft, 12 kids!
And they don't speak English! Uh, the Fishtraps only speak...German!
No no no, uh, a band lives there now!
Um, yes.
Yes, a big rock band with like eight people and all sorts of musical equipment so there's only room for musicians!
Mmmm, nice! Ah, it's like a beautiful dream! So peaceful, no more aggravation!  What is that porous terror up to now? Oh no, he's expecting a big family that speaks German!  Uh, German hallo?
Say what?
Uh, please, vould you speaken-zee English, I need za bractize!
Umm...Gerhard.
Ach, meine Neptune, uh, now is nein such a good time mit the wife and zuch!
She's shy...well, I must be going! Mein wifenz calling me for zupper! She is a fine Gutenchef of Fudenschlop!
Umm...kerglooginpfiefer mit schlusinberry klabber sauz.
I don't know...Hedvig!  Dunt movin! Not a schtepp!  Nein, nein! No moven sie! Sitz!  Hey, man, like, what's happening?
Oh, sorry, dude, no room. This place is, like, filled with band members and musical instruments.
Oh, pfft, the electric clarinet.
Sure there is.
I'll be right back!
Hedvig?  Oh, oh yeah, that's me, Hedvig!
One--  One second!  Tonight's zupper is to go, so please, to go!
I don't have children!  I mean- I mean, yeah, yeah, outside please!
Uh, groovy enough for ya, man?
Ve are der little kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, der kiddievinks, ve are der little kiddievinks, ve love to sing all day!
That's it, I'm done!
You idiots! It's not the Fishtraps' house, it's your house, and that is still Patrick's house! You just saw a commercial -- that's all!
He doesn't live in the houses he buys.
He flips the houses, you dimwits! He buys houses then resells them for a profit! He flips houses for a living!
Yes! And I'm calling Nick Fishkins right now to come over and flip my house, so I can move away!
What happened?
Who's that driving away?
And what did he say?
I...I can't believe you did that!
Ow! Ach du lieber...
What's he so happy about?  April 1st?  April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday!  Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today. I caught something terrible.
I caught sight of the calendar.
I have arrived.  What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?
Tell me what?
Well, it's been nice working here.  Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.
Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!
You do?
Well, as long as it's not me.
What are you doing behind the counter?
That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about!
April Fools!
I'll catch you, SpongeBob!  Whoops.  April Fools, you little sausage!  SpongeBob! I was just kidding! Cmon, cmon. You all know I was just kidding Right?
Wait, don't go!
Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh...  Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach.  Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo-  gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought.   SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob?  Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of This isn't something I normally do so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am...  Patrick? What are you doing here?
Why are you wearing that hat?
Where's SpongeBob?
With what?
SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there!  SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this!
SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy.
I'm trying to say I'm  hee-haw-hee-haw!
I'm just trying to say that I'm...  There's gotta be an easier way to do this.  Well, aren't you going to open it?
SpongeBob, I'm...  SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am...  ...sorry.  There you go.
I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear!
Mother?  All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and...
Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.
What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.
Really?
April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all!
Because, SpongeBob, fortune cookie fortunes are always lame and they never come true
No.  Way.
"You will be rewarded for your particular talent." Right.
Holy harpoons, the fortune did come true!
And that's why my depression is award-winning.
Hooray.
My tentacles are going to fall off if I don't get a break soon, Mr. Krabs!
And what about me?
Well, do I get re-hired for a new job at the museum too?
What? No, you don't fire meI quit! I got my resignation letter all prepared.  "Dear Mr. Krabs"
What thewhat?!  "I-I-I tender my resignation from this greasy establishment. Too long have I toiled under your iron claw. Now I am freefree to live my dreams of being a ballet dancer, ha-ha, and the first chair clarinet in the Bikini Bottom Orchestra, ha-ha, and I am going to finally publish my mystery/thriller novel: 'Dial D for Doily!"
Ow.
I was. They turned out to be nightmares. Apparently, you need more than 17 years behind a cash register to be qualified for dreams.  I never thought I would say this, but I'm begging you, SpongeBob, let me come back and work at the Krusty Krab Museum.
Totally out of character.
I hate everyone.  Huh, much better.
They taste like lice!
Huh?
What are you doing with thisow!
Shouldn't we chase after him? He didn't pay.
Of course it does. What do you think Krabs uses as filler?
Uh,  I am Animatronic Squidward. I cannot answer questions.
It was SpongeBob's idea. Him and Patrick are behind this. They forced me to help.
Huh?  Hmm.
Yes?
Oh, he responded hours ago.
Because I don't care.
I don't know who this P-Star7 is, but he's brilliant!
Huh?  "Squidward Tentacles should never be allowed behind a cash register." P-Star7? Oh, that is it! Why can't any of these yocals understand I'm working here? Ironically!
I'm gonna give you a number, of contusions!
Or we could push him off a cliff.
I AM NOT ANSWERING TO DELICATE FLOWER!
Oh, ratfish!
Oh, brother.  Please bring back P-Star7.
Another monotonous day I spend walking in slow motion towards an empty horizon?
Additionally, who cares?
Grr!! For the last time, we get it! Trucks have horns!
If I do, will you promise to stop?
Alright. Hey!
Typical.
I did it exactly the way you did it!
Well, at least we have plenty of food while we're stuck out here.
Mr. Krabs, we've got to stop for the night if you want SpongeBob and Patrick to live! I'm not saying that's what I want, I'm just telling you the facts.
Whoopee.
Maybe I could just eat the corner of the lettuce.
I'll lure him to sleep with a lovely lullaby.
What the?
Everybody's a critic.
How delightful!
Oh! It's like eating the inside of a lawn mower!
Yes!
I've got the best taste in town! Duh!
Uh, shouldn't we clear the docks? Or batten down the patches? Or whatever people say?
Probably because it's pay day.
It's alright now, everybody! Everything's under control now! And whatever!
Sorry. I don't think that's the captain's job. You're on your own.
Well, I guess that solves that problem.
Uh, uh, don't be hasty! Remember, I'm... I'm still the captain! The Hatty Patty was my idea!
Oh, barnacles!
Thank you! Thank you! Just doin' my job as captain protecting my crew.
Hello, Krusty Krab.
Are you crazy? I can't fight a monster!
I don't want to be captain! I don't want to be captain!
What about me?
Ha! You rube. There's no such thing as a Tooth Fairy.
It's all a bunch of made up baloney.
It is baloney!
There is no baloney! Just like there is no Tooth Fairy. In fact, if you could prove there were a Tooth Fairy, I would eat, oh, a bucket of chum!
I said I would, only if there was a Tooth Fairy, and since there isn't a Tooth Fairy, I will never have to eat a bucket of chum.
Ha, ha! Tooth Fairy! What a couple of molar morons!
Ha! I was right! The Tooth Fairy isn't real!
Oh, that's a good one.
Look at how betrayed Patrick feels! Oh, this was totally worth staying up all night.
Hey, come on! This is just a big misunderstanding! Ferry, fairy: They're two different words that just happen to sound alike!
No.
The sanctity of my bathroom. The only place in the world where I can...  let it all hang out.  Me...
Stop serenading me, you sap! It's my day off! Now, go away!
Aliens from Mars! It's an invasion!
The Martians are coming! Run for your lives! You're next! YOU'RE NEXT!
What? I thought I had my house sponge and star proofed!
NO! Now please fall and get seriously hurt!
I hate SpongeBob and I hate Patrick...
Loathing SpongeBob. Scorning Patrick. La, la, la, la, la, la.
That's it! I'm gonna clobber you two!
Will you two shut up about that stupid show?!
What the? How did...
Hey, Superdorks! Your turn to take out the garbage.
Because these two costume creeps chased them out.
Uh, that's okay. I don't need to hear. Uh...
Hmm?
You're a comic book geek!
So you read comics. Don't worry. Lots of perfectly immature adults read comics.
Oh, look at that. I think I've left my oven on.
Oh, don't tell me. Doctor Negative?
And cower in fear of Doctor Negative.
Oh, I don't think we're going to do that.
Being evil. Isn't that what you wanted? Aren't you scared? Boo-hoo?
No, Mr. Bob. I expect you to fry!
Too long have I suffered living between you two ninnies! But now, now as Doctor Negative, I shall finally exact my exquisite revenge!
Bring it around somewhere!
"I'll be in me office polishing yesterday's booty."
It wasn't an insult, Mr. Krabs. It was aaaa tribute. Haven't you ever heard of "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"?
Exactly. It's my homage to you and your love for money.
Oh, boy, that was a close one.
Already forgot about it.
Hurry up, SpongeBob, I need two orders of Krabby Krust stat.
Oh, that's it! I can't stand the perfect impression of me anymore! I never thought I'd say this, but I'm tired of looking at myself. I quit!
Here here.
Let me out! Let me out!
On it, sir! Hasta la vista, worm boy!
There will be no hugs! Get away from me, you monstrosity!
SpongeBob! I need a hug!
Oh, why can't I get to sleep? Let's try it again.  Warm milk.  White noise machine.
Dim lights.  Sleep, little Squidward, catch some winks everything and everybody clearly stinks
Hey! Will you two psychopaths keep it down?!
Horrible! I haven't slept for three days!
It is not great!  I've got an audition with the Bikini Bottom Philharmonic Orchestra tomorrow morning, and I'm a nervous wreck!
You know, normally, I jump up and scream when you appear like that. But I'm so tired, I'm just gonna take your stupid advice.
Taking a walk... walk... walk.
Home.
Whatwhat's going on here? Where am I? I'm at the audition. I'm playing, but I'm not in control. II feel like I've been taken over by something.
Must... gain... control!
What was thatSpongeBob? Patrick? You're inside me?! Oh, how did this happen? Get out of my mind!
Get out of my body! Justjustjust get out!
Oh, I am going to lambaste you two!
Ihuh? Oh.
I envy you common people. For you are about to have the glorious honor of hearing me play Gustav Mollusk's Symphony No. 5 in C Sharp Minor. For I am in complete control.
I cannot believe I let you talk me into this.
How's that?
They all seem so... full of germs!
Okay, I'm going in.
Krabby Patty? Krabby Patty?
You're contaminating the food! Just pick one!
I've been infected!
We have to get out of here! These children are menaces!
Now, where are we going to get tuxedos from?
Hey, what are you
Ew.
Oh, there's no way those people are gonna think our junk food is high class.
Who wants food? I'm a mindless drone with food. Working for the man. Huh?
Ooh.
Here you go, princess.
Let's do this thing.
Hey, where are you going?
Oh, down here.
I never heard of a marching quintet.
Uh, wait for me. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me. Wait, wait  Hey, hey!
What the?
Some people started calling it the "SpongeBob Patty!"
Maybe you should change the name of this place from the Krusty Krab to "SpongeBob's Place!"
Admit it. Without SpongeBob, you'd be nothing!
Haunted, eh?
Oh, admit it! You're jealous of SpongeBob!
These are being sent back!
Customers said to make them good like they used to be.
Oh boy... Huh?
Hey, everybody! Look who's back in the kitchen!
G'night, boss! See you in the morning!
"SpongeBob's Place?" What in the ocean?  Pardon me. Don't mind me!  Just trying to get in my own front door!
Everybody's a comedian. This is Squidward Tentacles, and I'd like to lodge a complaint about my neighbor SpongeBob.
Oh, no people are ever coming back here. Hey... no people. That's great! Because... I hate people!  I hate people! People hate me! I prefer my own best company! Single and secluded on my own! I can have the best of times all alone because I hate people!
I hate people! I'm still that way! La, la, la, la, la, la, hey, hey, hey!
I hate SpongeBob! I hate Krabs! I wish they would leave the ocean in taxi cabs! And all the customers can kiss my abs! 'Cause I'm the one and only
And...uh...oh...
Why I do raise seahorses!  Well, I don't know if I call myself international playboy!
Just what are you two ignorami doing out here?
It's not a sea spider, you dope! It's... my hair!
Wait a second. Hurt each other? Oh, I'm gonna enjoy seeing this.
Stop, stop, stop! I thought you said you were trying to hurt each other!
Well, you're not gonna do any damage with soft pillows!  Here, try this.
Ah! Sea spider!
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!
Hi-ya!
I said...
I was trying to say that you got to fall from something higher.
Ah! My baby!
Once again, I'm asking, what are you doing?
What?
They're the ones asking...
What are you yammering about?
Better take two? Life insurance?  You giblet heads! No piece of paper can protect a person from getting hurt!
Oh, that was just a coincidence!
Oh, it was just luck! Dumb luck!
Look, I'll prove it. You stand here.
Huh?  Hmm? Oh.
Wow, I can't believe it, but you two sub-geniuses were right somehow. I can't be broken. I'm indestructible! I am shatterproof! Watch this.
What does it look like? I'm running into a...  wall!
Did you see that? I ran right through a brick wall. I'm hard as nails! Come on, world! Bring it on!
Oh, perfect.
Pfft. Big tough guy.
Just watch. Enjoying your sherbet, Herbert?
Oh, I know it's not. Your name is "Hey." What's your name?
Told ya! Here, let me help you.
Funny, didn't feel a thing.
Ha! Germs can't hurt me. Nothing can hurt me!
As a matter of fact, do you know what I'm gonna do now? I'm gonna run your super dangerous obstacle course. You know why?
Because now I've got moxie!
Oh, what are those ninnies going on about now? I can't hear you! Just shut up and watch me!  Nahhey!
Will you stop shaking it?
No, no, no, no, no!
Ow...
Ha, how 'bout that?
It had to be this.
Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!
Yes. Mmm. Right. Mmm.
And now... for some soothing sounds from Squidward's clarinet. Thank you, thank you.
I thought I... Wha?
Oh, right. Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles.
Oh, please! I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles?
Oh, boy.
Hmm, business is booming.  How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors? Uh huh.
Huh?
Don't give me any of that! How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?!
That's not art. That's just annoying. Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.  Bubbles.  Art.
Ah, whoa, what?  Oh... who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?
Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble?  Here's your 25 cents!  Watch and learn.  Uhh... wait, wait, wait.  One more time. Here. Wait.  Uhh... Just a mere warm-up.
Technique? Technique!? Technique, technique, technique, technique, technique!  First I do this, spin around. Stop. Double take three times. And here we go, pelvic thrust. Wehooooo! Wehoohoo! Oh, stop on your right foot, don't forget it. Then, bring it around town. And a little of this, a little of that, a little of this, this, this, this, that, that, that, that. And that, that, that that that that! And then...
I really did it, didn't I? Hey, you guys didn't blow anything like that!
Now that's a bubble!
Technique? Hah! SpongeBob, you don't think I created that  beautiful work of art with your help?  Come on, it's in my genes.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I rock.
Hello, my friends. You are looking at a...
...genius.
SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
You don't know how lucky you are.
I'd love to hear one of your riveting sea tales, but I have to do my waste basket inspection.  Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one.
Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!
It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break.  What?
He took a break.
But Mr. Krabs, I still need help!
Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will.
Forget the stupid comic! We've got a situation here! We don't have any Krabby Patties, and these animals are trying to eat us instead!  Hey, who's responsible for this?
37 Krabby Patties! Fast!
Happy birthday to Cancer, sign of the crab. Not all Cancerius are crabby but they are all good at causing problems and blaming them on others. Many famous fibbers and elected officials are Cancers. My prediction for Cancer: This week you will fall asleep seven times. Don't worry you'll wake up.  I'm your Nicktoon Astrologer, Squidward, reminding you that it's bad karma to eat animated seafood.
Let's look at Gemini, sign of the twins. If you're a Gemini, you've probably experienced deja vu, a feeling that this moment has happened before. This month, Gemini's moon is in Uranus, so, you smell funny. Vibration for Gemini, you'll experience deja vu.  Meaning that this moment has happened before. I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon astrologer, reminding you not to touch my stuff.
This is Leo, sign of the lion. Hear him roar... The typical Leo has the voice as pleasant as a dental drill. If you have a Leo in your family, I suggest you move out or buy earmuffs. Leos often grow up to be junior high school vice principals! My prediction for Leo in the 12 months ahead, everyone you know will turn one year older! I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon astrologer, saying my powers are as real as any other psychics, and I'm a cartoon.
Say hello to Pisces, sign of the fish. If you a Pisces, people don't trust you. That's because Pisceans tend to lie, all the time. Even when they think they're telling the truth, they're not. For the Pisces who wants to stop lying, I have simple advice: never talk again. My prediction for Pisces in the year ahead: your nose will keep working just fine. I'm your Nicktoon astrologer Squidward, reminding you that psychic will tell you good things, if you tip them well.
Today, we explore Sagittarius. Sign of the uh... half-horse, half-guy with a bow and arrow. The good thing about Sagitarians: they have great aim. The bad thing about them: they poop while they're walking. So never march behind them in a parade. My prediction for Sagittarius in the coming year: you won't eat enough green vegetables. I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon astrologer reminding you that if you smelt it, chances are, you dealt it.
Say 'Happy Birthday' to Taurus the bull. Taurus is the most clumsy and oafish of all zodiac signs. They tend to break delicate objects just by walking past them. If no one ever invites you to their house you're probably a Taurus. From now on, only buy things made out of rubber. My prediction for Taurus in the coming year: you will eat a wide variety of different foods.  I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon Astrologer, reminding you no matter what your sign, you owe me five dollars.
Feh!
Six jamming jellies!  Ow!!
Those patties aren't going to cook themselves, SpongeBob.
Alright, SpongeBob, hand it over. Well?
Oh, gee, SpongeBob, that's a great idea. And maybe I should cook the patties and do the dishes and wear square pants and live in a pineapple while you wait in the unemployment line!
Then bring that patty here now!
Uh, SpongeBob? I'm over here! Now move!
SpongeBob!
SpongeBob!
Sponge...
I think my heart just stopped.  It's Sponge...  ...Bob's fault!
It's SpongeBob's fault.
Oh, what a beautiful day. And here I am trapped in a prison of high cholesterol.  No one ever comes in on Sunday.  Why can't Mr. Krabs just let us go home?  SpongeBob, stop ringing this bell!
I will ring the bell when there's an order. But...  ...there's no customers! There hasn't been one all day and there isn't gonna be any!
No!
You can count on me, sir!  Take care, Hurry back. Get well soon. You're in our thoughts.  Takes more muscles to frown than to smile.  Okay, SpongeBob, let's get down to business. My first official act as new manager is to give  a promotion.
You get to run the cash register.
You are-- It's part of the promotion I mentioned earlier. You'll be wearing  hats now. You're gonna take the orders and then you're gonna make them!
Me, too.
I've got some very important boss-like errands to run. See ya later.
What is it?
You push the button and put the money inside. Okay, you're on your own.
Well, Squidward, you've really outdone yourself this time. A beautiful day of relaxing and pampering... With pay. Hmm... I guess I do kinda feel bad for poor little SpongeBob, all by his lonesome... Oh, oh, it'll pass. He's probably just standing at the register with that stupid grin on his face.
I forgot to tell him how to make change! Oh!  Sponge...  ...Bob.
No, I am not. I just remembered I needed change for this dollar.
Alright, goodbye.  This is great. My day off, no worries, just relaxation.  I'm the boss, I deserve this. Ah...
Everything will be fine. There won't be any customers today anyway. He'll probably just stand there, bored.  SpongeBob, bored.
Oh, what  I doing?  I am wasting valuable relaxing time, that's what I'm doing! I mean, really. What are the odds? SpongeBob setting the Krusty Krab on fire.
It's me, you dunce!
What's that supposed to mean? I'm very busy.
I don't like your tone.
Just do your jobs!
Must... re...  ...lax!  Look at yourself. You're losing your bluish glow. Stop worrying so much. Now, repeat after me. You will not go back to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob!
No!  That's it. That's it. No matter what sick fantasies run through my mind, I will not go back to that restaurant!
No, I am not finished with those errands and I never will be. So quit checking up on me!  I know what you're up to.  Forcing me to come back here every time you mess up!
Okay,  maybe you haven't messed up yet, but you will.  will...  And when you do, I'll be there. I'll be there!
There!  Now I'll have to stay here and enjoy myself!  I'm not even gonna think about you-know-who at the you-know-what doing I-don't-care.  Just gonna... Relax.  Let Squid's day off... begin.   What was that?  It's SpongeBob. He's spying on me, to see if I'm really doing errands.  But, but he left his post.  And I've finally caught him messing up.  Aha! I caught you, Sponge...  ... Branch.  Heh, here's that rubber duck Mr. Krabs wanted me to get.  I've got you now! Wait'll Mr. Krabs finds out you're a...  ... Toilet. You're losin' it, Squidward. Calm down. If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say...
Aha!  I know you're in here.  What?  He's heading back to the Krusty Krab! I'll beat him there!  I've got you now, SpongeBob!
The truth will be revealed!
SpongeBob, you can't beat me!  Aha! I caught you now! You didn't think I knew you were a stick outside my window! Ha!  Or the toilet in my bathroom! And then you were in my bathtub, and I... And-and you... And I... And then you... Swam... Down the drain and... Beat me... to the Krusty... Krab.
Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands.  I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do.
Can we please stop this?
What's gonna happen? Am I gonna blow up?
Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time, understand?!
You wished for gum?
That's right! And you know what I wish?
I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
That's not what I meant!
I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
I don't have your money!
Mm-mm!
I'm sure it'll turn up.
Is that what he calls it?
Go away.
Stop it, SpongeBob.
What a nut job.
What the...!?
Knock it off, SpongeBob!
No, we are not there yet! And do you know how I know that?  BECAUSE THE BUS HASEN'T MOVED YET!
How disappointing.
SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?
No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?
So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions.
Well, I like it so far.
Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform.
Fish paste.
Well, I didn't think it was possible SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual.
Don't bother, only a fool would wear that.
Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.
For what, dare I ask?
Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?
That's it! I quit!
What? How'd you? When did you?
What the?
Wha?
Nooooo!
SpongeBob, I told you to stop calling me!
Could this day get any worse?  Wha...? Of course it can.
Because they've been stuck in this traffic with nothing to do for hours.
What the...?  Oh, like that's gonna make anybody feel bet...  ...ter.
I'm gonna be stuck here forever.
Guess who just quit?
Well, I guess it's safe to go in, now.
HA! Hahaha...  AH!
Ohhh...
Two Krabby Patties, no pickles.
No.
Yes.
Please come again. When I'm not working. Next.
How am I supposed to enjoy your day off if you come to work anyway?
This bubble is your friend?  Well, he's handsome, I'll give him that. What'll it be?
Well, thanks for stopping by.
Why would I do that?
He's an inanimate object, his money's no good here!
I'm not taking an order for a bubble.
May I take your order?
How about a glass of our finest shampoo?
Here's your hair care product, sir.
Mr. Krabs!
Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy.
And?
We? How about you take these patties and sho...
What, is he allergic to bread, too?
Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style!  And if there's anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask.
Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab.
Bubble money.  At least he left a tip!
He made me provide excellent service!
Wait! Don't waste this senseless violence on him! It's that stupid bubble of SpongeBob's that's causing all the problems!  Who's with me?
Enough sea-horsing around, SpongeBob! Give us that bubble!
Let's get this over with so I can go home and play my clarinet!
He's... alive?
Uh...hi?
To go home?
Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards...  ...that guy.
"I  you..."
It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of?
Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?
I'll buy the little twerp a gum ball.
The only thing I'm making is for the exit.
Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?
Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good.
Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one.
So, what flavor is it?
Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back.  Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now.
But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain!
And that's what happened.
It's not there.
Kill him?
No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!
You've seen this before?
Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times?  Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him?
You're right, Mr. Krabs!  I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it.  Drown in it!
Uh, SpongeBob?
I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift.
Please, don't do that.
Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of?
Great. Uh, let me see it.
Everything's in red.
We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.
Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.
Hey, Frank.  Glad that's over.
Which is...?
You're going to be wearing a salmon suit?
Who's there?
Oh, yeah...
[] I can't breathe.
Are you sure you should be poking it like that?
Does it involve more dismemberment?
Sunset?
C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Explosions... I mean, erosion.
Four... three... two... one...
Five... four... three...  two...  o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful.  I am such a good person.
Why are you still here?
Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to !
Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!
That's not what I meant, you barnacle head!
No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces!
Because the pie you ate was a bomb!
The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th...
Ouch.
I always thought the most important rule was "why do today what you can put off till tomorrow?"
Huh?
Aye aye, captain.  Two boxes of buns. Three pounds of patties.
What now, Mr. Krabs?
You're not Mr. Krabs.
Well... whatever you say, "Mr. Krabs."  Whoopee!
Okay hold still.
Say "money."
Um, Wormy?
Well, if Moron Theater's over, I'm just going to take a look at this monster.  That's the monster?
I should have known.  Well, that's it. I'm getting off the Looney Express.
Get a load of the scary monster.  Monster.
It's kinda cute.
Monster.
It's all in the wrist.
Okay, that's enough!
La da dee, la da doo, la da dum, La da dee, la da doo, la da dum.
Huh?
SpongeBob! What are you doing in here?
Whatever it is, can't it wait until we get to work?
What do you want?
Get out!
Yawn.
A hundred and one dollars for a Krabby Patty?
Who turned on the AC?  Mr. Krabs! Oh, no, this is terrible! Who's gonna sign my paycheck?
Pass.
Too bad SpongeBob's not here to enjoy SpongeBob not being here.
Some people have no taste in headgear.  Huh? Babies too?  Excuse me, miss, but where is everybody getting that horrid headwear?
Down here.
Chum Bucket?... Free?... Krabby Patty?... Plankton?... Giving?... With?
So you're selling Krabby Patties, eh, Plankton?
No. You may have hoodwinked everyone else in this backwater town, but you can't fool me. I listen to public radio.
It means you set up Mr. Krabs. You stole the crown so Neptune would freeze him and you could finally get your stubby little paws on the Krabby Patty formula.  It was you all along. But you made one fatal mistake. You messed with my paycheck. And I'm gonna report you to the highest authority in the land, King Neptune!
Huh? What?
What's going on here?
I'm getting outta here!
Huh?  Ow!
Mr. Krabs!  SpongeBob, zip it!
The customers are getting restless. They're asking for...  refunds.
So is he an anemone or Plankton?
Huh, what?
We get the rest of the day off?
Seriously?  Aren't you overreacting a bit?
I prefer suede.
We're out of Krabby Patties right now!
Still out of Krabby Patties.
Squidasaurus Rex!
(gloats) You heard him!
Wait. You mean we can just take this stuff off?
How do you expect us to go up to the surface? We won't be able to breathe!
Yeah, I'm with you guys.
Actually, I have four feet.
What  it about then?
The only way we're going up there is if some fairy godmother shows up and helps us breathe air.
SpongeBob, you know this guy?
There's no way I'm climbing into some dolphin's mouth.
Not a lot of leg room in here.
Ow, my neck.
Ugh! This place smells awful!
Well, I guess this is where that horrible smell was coming from.
Whoa! Whoa!
[annoyed by their laughing] Ugh! When is the sugar gonna wear off?
We're never gonna make it!
SpongeBob!
What do you mean rewrote the story?
Nice. So this is what teamwork gets you.
[embarrassed] It happens when I'm nervous.
Rock-hard abs!  Aw, SpongeBob, you're okay in my book.
That sound must mean things are back to normal.
You know what this needs? A little interpretive dance!
Mmm, mmm! Good, sir!
Bow-tie French fries?
Pretty Patties, Pretty Patties!
Be quiet, SpongeBob!
I love bursting your bubble, SpongeBob, but they're laughing at you, not with you.
Your forehead.
Cheer up, SpongeBob. I know someone who still likes you.
Yeah, your grandma!
The fan stopped--
I told you.
What next?
Look, surf boy! Are you gonna teach us how to surf, or do we have to stand there and stare--
What is going on out here?
Playing with a reef blower? That is the most childish thing I have ever heard of.
Fun?! How could playing with one of those over-sized hair dryers possibly be fun?
Chafed.  Alright, that's...!
Put my windows back!
SpongeBob, this is the final straw. I am going to move so far away, that I will be able to brag about it. I would-  I would rather tear out my brain stem, carry it into the middle of the nearest four-way intersection, and skip rope with it, than go on living where I do now.
Four-way!
No! No!
Hello?
I'm here about the happiness. I'll be moving in now.
No. I mean, yes. There's nobody with me. Yes, peace and quiet.
No.
No, no starfish. Just a regular, normal, peace-loving-  Heaven at last.
Oh, which way to the Living-without-a-brain seminar? Don't be late.
This place is even better than I expected!  302, 303, and 304. Beautiful.  And not a pineapple in sight.
Good night, Clary. Tomorrow, we begin life anew.
304 New Life street, Squidward speaking.  There is no way I am moving back there, SpongeBob. I am finally among my own kind.  Now goodbye!
Ahh. I think I'll take my bike today.  I'm my own man.  Now these neighbors know how to live.  Intensive. Hmm I bet they won't have-  They have it!  "Canned Bread"! This town is great!  I would really be impressed if it had---  ---an interpretive dance academy?!?  Yeah! It's even better in a group!  This town is perfect.  A clarinet trio?!  Aah, another great day.  Oh look! Everybody's on their bike today.  It just gets better and better!  All together!  I sorta don't feel like playing my clarinet today.  Yep, this is great. They might as well rename this town "Squidward's Paradise." Or perhaps too much paradise.  SpongeBob?  Oops.  Leaves. Just getting the leaves.
Looks like when it comes to having fun, you don't have a "leg" to stand on!
But it's fun!
Like this!
Tag! You're it!
Stand back! I've got gardening tools!
What is it?
Grievances! This town is a grievance! There should be a law against so many stuck-up tightwads living in one place! This city needs to be destroyed! or at least painted a different color.
Hey, you're right!  And I'm leaving ASAP!
Freedom! Woo-hoo!
He's not in my thoughts.
How about a break?! We've been at it for days!
Oh look, it is I, SpongeBob, out here in the open.
Yawn.
I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts.
Oh, brother.
Ooh.
SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter.
Excuse me, coming through, out of the way.
My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth.
Sounds like someone felled my old coral tree! SpongeBob, Patrick, why'd you do this to me!?
Go away before I harm you bodily!
What? Who, me? Would you look at the time, I should go!
What do you want? Can't you see that I'm busy!?
SpongeBob, take this stuff down immediately!
SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob, forget it.
SpongeBob, no.
I'm not writing a letter to a figment of your imagination.
SpongeBob, how many times do I have to say it? I don't believe in Santa Claus!
My self-respect. My sanity. My lunch.
Santa Claus is a big phony! SpongeBob has got you all fooled.
Those idiots are gonna be up all night while I get a full nights sleep.
Ahh, morning already? Oh, boy!  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Wait. Oh, I see a great Christmas photo op. Could you move in a little? Say Santa Claus.
Aww, our first Christmas. This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas. The first Christmas is this Christmas.  Cause it feels like the first Christmas to me.
What? What's this?
Oh, gee, I, uh, you know I...
SpongeBob? He made me a present? It's probably a jellyfish net, or an old Krabby patty, or...  his favorite underpants. Haha.  Why, it looks like a clarinet.  It smells like one, too. Handcrafted on driftwood. And it's even got my name on it.  What's this?  Wow. This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten. Oh, I feel like a... I feel like a... I feel like a...  big jerk. What have I done to poor SpongeBob? Uh, hey, SpongeBob? I... SpongeBob?
Poor little guy. All he wanted was to spread a little joy.
Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!
Up here you dunce.  I mean, uh, Merry Christmas little boy.
Yes, it is I, Santa Claus. Ho, ho, ho...
Hey, uh, kid, take it easy.
SpongeBob? SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!
Don't do that again.
Well, that, um, is a result of, uh, undersea pressure on my body.
Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter bunny.
Alright! I'm Santa.
I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did.
Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over.
Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really...
Uhh, right, just a second.  C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A box of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect!  There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho!
That almost felt good.  I didn't... who?
Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people.  Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. A-ha! A bowl of mashed potatoes for you.
Here you go, Patrick.
What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane?  You might as well take the door. It's all that's left.
Well, at least it's over.  Huh? What's this?
Yup, I'm insane.
Hm.
Of course you are. Bye now.
Really? Jellyfishing with you guys? Oh, that would be the best day ever in my book! I would love to go jellyfishing! I can't think of anything I'd like to do more on my day off than go jellyfishing with my two best friends: SpongeBob and... uh...
Right. But I can't. Bye bye.
Oh sure, right! Whatever.  Like that'll ever happen.
Jellyfishing.  Oh, I'll go.  I sure had them going.  Stupid jellyfish! Beat it!
Ow.
What's she blabbering about?
And drowning, don't forget drowning!
Not on your life, sport.
How about this?  Huh?
How long can she stay like that?
Do we have to wear pickle jars?
We can't, uh...because...
Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it.  ...What?
: This is pretty easy.
SpongeBob! Do you have to knock so loudly?
Oh... that overgrown clam is giving me a headache! I can't even take my afternoon beauty nap!
You know the guy who did it?
Oh, this is great! You and I can go turn him in! And then I'll get so much sleep, I'll be gorgeous!
You mean you don't know who did it?
That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away!
Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away!  Now look what you've done!
Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.
Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
All right, who owns this crate?  Come on out! I wanna file a complaint!
I...no, I don't.
I never said that.
Ow.
Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's...
No, no, they're not. Whew.
Will we be getting business cards?
Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting!  Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea...  Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me...  Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act?
Boy, I'm glad all that's over!
Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!
Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time, understand?!
You wished for gum?
That's right! And you know what I wish?
I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!
That's not what I meant!
I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.
Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?
But why have we been turned into fruits?
Please tell me this isn't a joke.
Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea! You've got looks... talent... all you need is a full head of...  hair!
I think I fancy a stroll around the park.
What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy!  Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair!  SpongeBob!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!
One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don't have the whole day.
Come on, SpongeBob!
Les quit fooling around, where's my Krabby Patty?
You're killing me SpongeBob! Ha ha ha... you really are. .
Okay, give it to me.  Come on SpongeBob, stop it!
Be quiet, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm talking to you! SpongeBob! SpongeBob, are you mad?
Mediocre?
Hello. You've reached the house of unrecognized talent. Please start after the
Squilliam Fancyson from band class?!
Sometimes. Uh, how's the unibrow?
The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba?!?!
Ohh, uhh, I... I, uhh...
Hold it! It just so happens that I  sell fast food, I  have a band, and we're gonna play that Bubble Bowl! How do you like that, Fancy Boy?!
I gotta drum up a marching band fast! Drum... haha... band humor.
Stupid music rental clerk made me late. That trilobite didn't know an oboe from an elbow. Elbow, heh, more band humor.
People, people, settle down! Ok, now. How many of you have played musical instruments before?
No.
No, Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument.  Horseradish is not an instrument, either.  That's fine. No one has any experience. Fortunately, I have enough talent for all of you.
Ok, try to repeat after me.  Brass section, go.  Good. Now the wind.  And the drums.  Too bad that didn't kill me.  Let's just try stepping in the rhythm. Now I want everyone to stand in straight rows of five.
No, SpongeBob, that's a chorus line.
Okay, that's perfect everybody. Bubble Bowl here we come. Flag twirlers, really spin those things. Okay, turn. Flag twirlers, let's go. I wanna see some spinning. Flag twirlers let's move! C'mon, move!
How's that harmonica solo coming Plankton?
Well, this is our last night together before the show. And I know that none of you improved since we began...  ...but I have a theory. People talk loud when they wanna act smart, right?
So, if we play loud, people might think we're good. Everybody ready? And a one, and a two, and a one, two, three, four!  OK, new theory. Maybe we should play so quietly, no one can hear us.
Wait, wait. I know tensions are high...  There's a deposit on that equipment, people!  Settle down, please!
Well, you did it. You took my one chance in happiness...and crushed it! Crushed it into little tiny, bite-size pieces. I really expected better of you people. I guess I'm a loser for that, too. Don't bother showing up tomorrow. I'll just tell them you all died in a marching accident. So, thanks.  Thanks for nothing!
I knew this was gonna happen. They're just gonna have to find another band to play. I just hope that...  ...Squilliam doesn't find out! Squilliam!  What are you doing here?!
Uh, they couldn't come. They... died.
That would be my band!
That's his... eager face.
Well, I guess this will be the last time I can show my face in this town.
Alright, everybody.  Let's get this over with. 1, 2, 3, 4...
Now! 8:00! So long, suckers! I've got a hot date with a little lady, and her name is:  Clarinet.  What?
Read the sign.
No, you won't! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life.
What!?
Mr. Krabs..
Mr. Krabs?
No.
Here. Please hit me as hard as you can.
Don't hold back.
Will you please?! Here,  give me a moment's peace and take out the trash!
That's where the dumpster is, yes.
But I thought you liked the night shift.
So you're not afraid?
Well I am. Especially after,  well, you know.
You don't remember? It was all over the news.
No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you.
You mean you've never heard the story of the  "Hash-Slinging Slasher?"
The Hash-Slinging Slasher!
Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha  because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!
Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.
No.
No!
NO! He cut off his own hand by mistake.
Except he wasn't a sponge!
So it didn't grow back!
And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?
Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.
Then he'll be coming.
There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First, the lights will flicker on and off. Next...
Oh, here you go.  Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there.  And finally, the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over.  Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead!  Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand..
He opens the door  He slowly approaches the counter  ...and you know what he does next?
You really want to know?
Are you sure you want to know?
He gets ya!  SpongeBob...  SpongeBob I wa...  I was ju...  I was jus...  SpongeBob, I was joking!
It's not true! None of it's true!
Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.
Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?
Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here!  Very funny, SpongeBob.
"And the lights will flicker on and off." Just like the story. I get it.
I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day!  What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?
Nice try, what?
SpongeBob, I'm not doing this.  Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights,  and the phone,  and the walls will ooze green slime!  No, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing?
They don't!
The SASH-RINGING, FLASH-SINGING, THE BASH-PINGING...
At last you understand! We're doomed!
SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One - I hate you. And two - how can that be me when I'm standing right here!?
SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!
Huh?
Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights?
Oh, no, not a penny. Help, somebody help us.
Lilac.
Excuse me. Does this lovely couple belong to you? They've been standing outside my house saying "Where's Patrick?" all day! It's driving me nuts!
He means this filth, you loon.
Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.
Er...he said...um, well he said...
Don't you mean there are only 7?
Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image.  And I'll go down in history, someday. And there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world.
Uncultured trash urchin. 9am. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer.  Welcome to art class!
SpongeBob? In art class? Wait! This is cooking! Come back! You gotta be kidding.
You're looking at him.
Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.
So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?
Well, art is not all fun and games.  It's a lot of hard...  ...work. OK. First, repeat after me: I have no talent.
Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.
If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacles talent will rub off on me.
Whatever. Ok. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say circle one.  Am I going too fast for you SpongeBob?
What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.
Gimme that.  Forget the circles.
Gimme that.  There is nothing artistic about leapfrog.  What are you doing, now?
Do you want to learn art, or not?
Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. And...
It's beautiful!  I mean, this isn't a sculpture.  A good sculpture takes... more time. You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules.  Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong.  There, now it's art.
Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late.
The world famous art collector?
Well, what are you doing here?
Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one: "Squidward en repose".
Why not?
How about this one? I call it: Bold and Brash.
Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh...
Fame.
Fortune.
Anything?  It's me. It's me. I'm responsible.
I could use a little help.  My fame, my fortune, my hair.
Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off.
Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. I gotta find SpongeBob!!  SpongeBob...SpongeBob? SpongeBob!
Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible.
Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty.
Really!
Really!
Really.
Let's go.
Gimme that.  Ok, SpongeBob. Just do what you did before.
Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again.
Huh? But, but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the...
Uhh...  How about this, huh? Remember?
Forget about the book.  Ha! Look at all this mess SpongeBob.  What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do?
OK, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble.
Now you've got it.
Right.
Well, uh, ok.
Uhh...
Here you go, buddy.
Oh, boy.
As of now, it's his responsibility.  Good day to you, sir.
Thank you for choosing the Krusty Krab. Here's your change.
What?
You hardly pay us at all!
Ah, yes! Our meager restitution.  Ah, the sweet smell of payday.  Huh?
What is this!?!  You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register? What is the meaning of this? Have you gone off the deep end?
Uh, SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing?
Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same.
In fact, you and I should go on strike!
Sure! After all, you like your job, right?
And you want to keep working here, right?
And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?
Then let's go on strike!
SpongeBob!
News flash, SpongeBob! I got fired, too!  This is exactly why we need to go on strike.  He can't treat us like this anymore!
He owes us for all the precious, irretrievable moments we've wasted in this trash heap.
Soon, he'll realize he needs us more than we need him. We are workers united!
Ahem.
Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time you'll have your job back and more.
Alright SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms,   I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so.  Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob.
That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground.
SpongeBob, you're pathetic. Look, I threw my hat to the ground.
Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking.
Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!
...No.  This is a picket sign: Krusty Krab Unfair. Short, sweet, and to the point.
SpongeBob, it's "unfair," not "funfair"!
Attention, SpongeBob!   You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat.
I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there.
Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect.  Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!
We will dismantle oppression board by board!  even if it takes
With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs'
as long as they can get their instant gratification.
Dismantle your oppressive establishment?
On strike with SpongeBob... forever?
I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!
You'll give us anything we want?
Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms.
I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs.
S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?
Wow. Squidward, this is the best souffl you have ever created. Congratulations, chef!
Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend!
Yeah, Patrick, we're friends...  just friends.
Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Ow! My back! I threw out my back!
SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
No, no, no, get away from me!
No, no! Get away from me! No, no!
No, no! Get away!  Oh! I'm ruined! I'm... I'm... I'm... I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You're a real friend!
N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no.
You play?
Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh!
Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself.
Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on!
This can't be happening to me!
Oh, this is nuts! I need a plan to get those two back together and out of my hair!
Come on in! You look stunning.
I thought you two were my best friends.
Well, how about some soda, guys?
Patrick! Your glass is full!
Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more.  Why don't you just stay here and chat?  I should just walk away right now.  What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today?
Great, now go be friends somewhere else.
NO! Out!
Ohhhhh, my back.
That idea may just be crazy enough... to get us all killed!
SpongeBob, do you remember that little talk we had about 'personal space'?
Co-Cashier?
You can't do this to me, Mr. Plankton! If you think I'm going to stand out there all day listening to...
Then you must have coral wedged in your frontal lobe!
I'd like my view to be a little less yellow, if you know what I mean.
There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go.
What?
What's that supposed to be some kind of stupid secret code?
Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron?  Moron...  as a requirement.
Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!
Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in?  Why, you should be begging me to join!
Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!
Shut your half-wit pieholes!  I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club!
Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!
Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!
Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery? Why-y-y-y?!
Well... this is the end.
What's that?
You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?
Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!
I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!
All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity!  But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns...  sad...  clowns.  What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost!  Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here!  Huh?  I'm  Take that, SpongeBob and Patrick!  Huh? Ohhh...  there's no way out of here.  How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight?  Ah...  Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days.  How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any.  And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell!  If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam...  that tells you nothing! As if the answers to solve all your problems will fall right out of the sky!  Fall right out of the sky!
Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.
Everything sure looks delicious.  Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite!  Uh, hey, uh,  SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um...
Umm...uh..yeah?
Yeah.  Now, uh, if you'll excuse me...  All right... What shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?
Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.
Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic.  Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?
Oh. Then how about the soup?
Could I have anything to eat?
No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!
Give me that!  Can I have something to eat?
Can I have something to eat?
Can I have something to eat?
Can't you say anything else but no?
Can I have something to eat?
I'm   You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!
Abra.
All hail the magic conch!
Huh?
Good morning, flowers.
What the...?
Don't say anything Squidward, remember your karma.
SpongeBob, where's my order?
No I didn't, sorry.  SpongeBob, could you just get my order?
SpongeBob, there's no ghosts!
In case you've forgotten, here's how things work. I order the food, you cook the food, the customer gets the food.  We do that for forty years and then we die. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, what do you say?
What's that?
Just get my order.
Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen.
Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway.
Why don't you ask CowBob RanchPants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot?
Hey, who left this bowl of onions here?
What? Would you get out of here?
Hey, Mr. Krabs, looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad!
Here you go, sir. A King-Size Ultra Krabby Supreme with the works, double batter fried  on a stick.
Barnaclehead.
You forgot your mayonnaise.
Look at them eating that garbage.  It's . They're sickening. I hate Krabby Patties.
Good what?
Yeah, well, not me.
Don't encourage them! They'll never leave.
That's me. Never had one, never will.
I've never had a Krabby Patty and never will.
I've never had a Krabby Patty.
I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty!
Get that garbage outta my face!
Try one of those radioactive sludge-balls you call food? Next, I suppose you'll want me to go square-dancing with Patrick.
No.
No!
Quit it.
SpongeBob, if I were trapped at the bottom of a well, for three years, with nothing to eat but that Krabby Patty, I'd eat my own legs first...  and not just the extra ones.
Ggood for you?! That thing is a heart attack on a bun!
Oh, puh-lease! I have no soul!
No.
No.
No.
If I didn't want it out there, what makes you think I'd find it more appealing in here?!
No.
No...
!
Listen, SpongeBob, how long are you prepared to keep this up?  Give me that! When I die...you stay away from my funeral.  Ohh... do I really...
Why... this Krabby Patty may be the most...  Horrible! Putrid! Poorly prepared! Vile!  Unappetizing! Disgusting excuse for a sandwich, that has ever been my displeasure to have slither down my throat!
And I curse this Krabby Patty, and all who enjoy them, to an early and well-deserved !  Get it?
Nobody but me.
Does this look unsure to you?
Good! Now go spread the word!
Come on! Come on! Come on!  Ah... still alive!  Oh, soooo delicious!  Oh...! All the wasted years...!  I gotta have more. I gotta have !  But wait!  After that performance, he'd never let me live it down! I gotta sneak one. Just one, then... I'm off the stuff for !
Uhh, SpongeBob?
I need a Triple Krabby Supreme on a kelp bun,  with with extra sea pickles and, and burn it to a crisp, okay?
Don't go...
Well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back.
What do I have to do? Eat one out of the garbage?
I had to say garbage... but, okay!
Hmm, honey...  What? Oh... I have got to get my hands on a Krabby Patty! And no one's gonna stop me!  There it is!
Holy shrimp! I don't know where to start.  All that matters is that it's just you... and me... and nobody...
SpongeBob? Uh, uh, uh... what are you doing here?
Uhh, I forgot my...
Oh, I thought that...
I... I... I... no, I didn't do...
No, no, wait... it's not what you think. Th-this is a big misunderstanding. You've got to believe me, I... Listen, I am telling you...  You better listen to me, SpongeBob!
Yes! Yes! I admit it, SpongeBob! I  Krabby Patties!
What's gonna happen? Am I gonna blow up?
My thighs?
I didn't realize it was Happy Hopping Moron Day.
That's a big box!
They probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap.  Huh? A brand-new television?
Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider.  Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?
Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't you two have any brains?!
Wow, I never thought of it that way. That's really something. Can I have your TV?
Patrick, you're already a starfish.
Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV...  ...and there it is! Can I have it, SpongeBob?
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
I hope they put some air holes in that box.
Now where's that remote?
Morons.
Will you two shut up?!  Sponge... Bob?
[confused] What the? How were you two making that noise?
Yes! But those sound effects: the avalanche, the, the, the...
Forget it.  I don't know why I'm wasting my time out here when I could be watching my brand new television.
Grrrr... Aha!  How are you two doing that?
The noises! How are you two making those noises?
Are you trying to say that I have no imagination? I have more imagination...  ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies.
I'll show them!  There's got to be one in here!  Ah! This hat box should do nicely.  Why haven't I worn this yet?
What do they want with me? What did I do?  Obviously, I've violated some new box kicking law!  Look officers, everything's okay. I won't do it again!
I got to try to relax. Perhaps I can drown out their childish games with a little TV.
Isn't there anything on that isn't about BOXES?!
Heh-heh, I guess this is okay. I mean, it's not really about boxes.  I give up.
How are they doing that? That was the most realistic space launch I ever heard! There must be an explanation. Think, Squidward, think!
Laugh at me, will they?  All right, where is it?
Don't "Where's what, Squidward?" me! Where's the tape recorder?
Don't "We don't have a tape recorder, Squidward!" me!
All right, make way you two, I'm coming in.
No, no. Don't mind me, I'm just here to observe.
All right, fine!  Take me to Robot Pirate Island! I wanna arm-wrestle with cowboys on the moon! Just do it so I can get back and watch TV!
Why won't this thing turn on?!  All right, fine. If you don't want to show me,  I don't care! I've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing.  How do those two work that thing? There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that!  Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think! I got it: when those two go to bed, I'll sneak in there and find that button! I'll wait all night if I have to!
Hello, what's this?  "This plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the Robot Menace. Lest we forget... Ohh!  I've got to find that button quick!  It's got to be around here somewhere. I don't see anything! It's just an empty box! Maybe it really  their imagination. Oh... get it together, Squidward! What are you saying? I mean, do I really believe that if I sit here and pretend to drive a race car that I'm suddenly going to start hearing noises?  What the...?  It actually works! I can't believe it! Ha-ha! Oh boy! This beats TV by a long shot!  Whooo-hoo-hoo! This is the most fun I've ever had!
Vroom! Vroom! Only two more laps to the finish line!  I'm in the lead! Out of my way! I'm almost there!  Whoo-hoo-hoo! Victory is mine!
Can I help you?
Whatever. Five dollars, please.
No.
This is a restaurant, not a lending library. And who are you calling big nose, big nose?
I'm shakin'. Heh. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Here's your shake, sir.  Grr.
SpongeBob, what's going on in here? Huh?  Why's everything all tiny?
What do you got there?
No, really?
You've got something alright, let's see it!
Is that Mermaid Man's belt?
Wow! I can't believe he'd lend it to you!
He didn't lend it to you, did he?
You stole it?
Oh. I'm telling.
Uh Oh!  There's the phone.
I'm walking towards the phone!
I'm getting closer to the phone!
And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for.
Hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid...  What the? What?  Ow!
What did you do to me?
SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size right now, you are gonna be in really big trouble!
I said now!
Do you hear me?!  Holy fish paste! Get it off me! Get it off me!  Don't you know how to work that thing?
Stop! I've got an idea. Let's call Mermaid Man and-
N-n-n-n-no.
I wonder if a fall from this height could be enough to kill me.
Hey! Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?!
SpongeBob, will you just face facts? You've shrunken everybody in Bikini Bottom! You've got to go to Mermaid Man!
Now I have to drive five miles to go to the bathroom....in my own home!
I guess this is okay.
What?
Ready to move?
Ah, yes. Warm fire, cozy slippers, and a piping hot cup of tea with a lemon wedge.  Why do I even bother?  Would you two please keep it down?!
Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity. You and General Nonsense over there will have to fight without me.  Got 'em Both.  Grrrrrrrr!
Yes? Oh, Patrick.  What an unpleasant surprise. Oh, boy, nothing like a game of charades.
Fascinating.  Now, where was I?  What?
Patrick, go use your own bathroom.
No.
No.
No.
Okay, make it quick.
Look, SpongeBob, I was just...  SpongeBob! Oh...
I most certainly am not!
No, SpongeBob, I'm not on your side either. I'm on nobody's side. Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level.  If you two want to knock each other's brains out with snowballs, kindly leave me out of it.
Hmm...
Now there's something I'd actually like to see!  Nothing wrong with getting a front-row seat, I suppose.  Ahh. What's this?  Wha... I... no!  What are you doing? You're supposed to be knocking each other's brains out!
No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty!  There! Let the war continue!
Look, you two are giving up too easily. Now, Patrick, pretend I'm SpongeBob.
You're Patrick.
No! Wait, why?
Would you butt out?!
I'm SpongeBob! You're Patrick!  Now, what are you going to do?  Patrick, why didn't you hit SpongeBob?
Oh, boy. All right, I can see where this is going. Let's just say for all intents and purposes that I, Squidward, am now part in this war. Now...
I don't have one, okay? Now...
Okay, fine? You want a fort?  There. There's your fort! Now...
It's okay, Patrick. It's just a demonstration. Now...
Trust me, it's fine.
Not if I crouch down. I mean, you didn't even give me a chance to crouch down.  See? Down here, I am perfectly...
Would you two please...  ...stop throwing...  ...snowballs?!
No-no... no, wait, wait, wait!  I was just giving a demonstration!  All right, that's it! You guys asked for it!  I got him! Ha! I got him!  In your face, SpongeBob!  This was actually kind of... exciting! Why... I've never felt so alive!
Take that... I got you... Yeah... oh, I got you... oh, take that... Whoa, I got you that time... Oh yeah...  Incoming!
What's going on? The snowballs have stopped falling. I better take advantage of this momentary cease-fire.  What? My left flank is exposed? That bloated starfish is gonna run right through me!  I'll just fix that right now.  Wait, that makes my north wall a weak spot! Here we go! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh! But if they attack from the rear, I'm a goner!  There... Ha-ha!  But what about the possibility of an aerial attack!  I guess that ought to do it!  Fort Squidward is now all but impenetrable!  Now, where are those fools?  Ha! The first shot has been fired!  Take this, Patrick!  Taste my frozen fury!  Victory is mine!  Whee! Ha-ha! Well, I got you now!
What a baby.
What?
We're making the commercial, Mr. Krabs.
This is all necessary.
That's the useless junk for scene, uhh, 28.
Mr. Krabs, everyone needs an understudy.
This job gets very stressful, Mr. Krabs.
Well, this is just great. Now we've got no crew to make the commercial.
But, but, but, but, but, but, but...
What's your problem, Amy?
Where's that coming from?
There you are, SpongeBob. I need you to...
To my tailfin?
Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders?
I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us.  On second thought, keep 'em waiting.
Enter-what?
Hey!
Then why don't you back in the kitchen and grab some patties and give them what they came here for!
29, 30, 31...
Mr. Krabs, can we please go now?
But that's not fair!
Teacher's pet.
What?
Well, I've never seen it.
Of course I'm...what are you saying?
You're saying something!
Are you accusing me of something?
I didn't take your precious dime!
What?!
Here! Here! Here! See 'em?!
Not anymore, Mr. Krabs. I quit!
I'm out of here!
Mistake? Ha! The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab!
Being dead, or anything else!
Where have you been?
Can I have one--?
SpongeBob, I don't need your help. I am ready to unlock my potential. I could be anything I set my mind to.  I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman.
Yeah...uh-huh. Ya know, that reminds me, there's been something I've been wanting to say to you since the day we met... Goodbye. Next time you see me, this town will be eating out of the palm of my hands!  Spare change? Spare change, ma'am?
Uh, I , uh...
SpongeBob?
Yes?
Uh...no--where.
No.
No.
Don't you get it?  I'm a lose-e-er! I lost my job, my home, everything!
Nobody would take them. So I had to eat them.
Ok, but just until I get a job. one day...two days tops.
And in bed, too? Aw, thanks SpongeBob. SpongeBob, I...
It's really nice of you to help me in my time of need. I'll try not to be a burden.
No, no, no. You've already...well...
SpongeBob, can I get a glass of water?  Thank you.
SpongeBob, could I get some more blankets.
Thank you.  SpongeBob, you forget to turn out the light!
SpongeBob, where's my lemonade?
SpongeBob?! SpongeBob?!  And why aren't you in uniform?  It's about time you got here!
I can't drink that.
Are you blind? Just look at it.
That lemon has 3 seeds in it. That's an odd number! I can't eat anything odd numbered.
No! No! It's already contaminated by the bad lemon! It won't work!
Then go fix them.
I've changed my mind. I want soup instead.
Condensed soup from a can? Disgusting! Now you've ruined my appetite! Go fetch me something to read!
Get that away from me! You know I'm allergic to newsprint!
4 o'clock. Time for my stories. Hurry up, they won't hold the show while you laze around.
This isn't my show. SpongeBob, the remote control is broken! Get over here and fix it!
What are you saying?
Well, it's kind of good to be back, sir.
I agree, sir.
What the...? What are you saying?
Are you accusing me of something?
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.  I'm done with my shift, Mr. Krabs! And let me just say, there will come a day when I will make something of my life and I will never have to set foot in this grease trap again!
Oh, shrimp! It's my arch rival from high school, Squilliam Fancyson! I can't let him see me in my Krusty Krab uniform.
Yes... I mean no... I mean... uhh, uhh... Hey, whatcha been up to?
You are no great shakes, Squilliam Fancyson. Anyone can be a big shot in a hick town like Bikini Bottom.
Don't be intimidated, Squidward. Try to imagine him in his underwear.  Oh, no, he's hot!  I'm, uhh, in... food service.
Don't lie. Lying always makes it worse.  I own a five-star restaurant!
That's right.
T-t-t-t-t-t-tonight?
Please, Mr. Krabs, you got to help me! When they get here tonight, they're going to see I'm just a big phony and a loser!
This is serious.
Mr. Krabs! Please let me run the restaurant for just one night! I really need to impress Squilliam.
Don't rub it in.
Alright, listen up. Men, Squilliam Fancyson will be here in twenty minutes. Therefore, we need to turn the Krusty Krab into a fancy restaurant as soon as possible.  Patrick, what are you doing here?
The Corps? What the... Patrick, this isn't the... oh!  Beggars can't be choosers. Can you take hats in a dignified and sophisticated manner?
Alright, I've heard enough. You've got the job.  Mr. Krabs, didn't you once serve on the S.S. Gourmet?
Then you'll be our chef.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but SpongeBob, you're going to have to be the waiter.
It's the guy who goes to tables and takes orders.
Yes, they do that! Now listen, Squilliam is on his way and you have less than twenty minutes to become a fancy waiter, so read this.
Alright, I've got all the positions filled. I just might pull this off!
He's just the hat-check guy, nothing essential!  What happened? What is it?
Mr. Krabs, you gotta take them out of the...  Holy fish paste, what is that?!
But I thought you said you were the head chef on the S.S. Gourmet?
There you are! SpongeBob, you gotta help me!  Patrick and Mr. Krabs aren't working out, and Squilliam's almost here, and, and... SpongeBob?
What?
SpongeBob, hold on! Let's just take a second here to relax.  Little more.  Little more.  Good. Now, I want you to empty your mind.
Empty your mind.
Empty your mind of everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining. Fine dining and breathing.
How do you feel?  SpongeBob?  This isn't working! I gotta go tell Squilliam I need more time!  I'll just go to Squilliam's house and...  Squilliam, you're here!
Wait, Squilliam, I've got to explain!
How did you do all this?
But what about Krabs and Patrick?
Pinch me, I must be dreaming.  Ow!
SpongeBob, I can't thank you enough for all you're doing!
It worked. I can't believe it! Squilliam thinks I own a five-star restaurant. Time to rub it in his face.  Well, Squilliam, I'm waiting.
In that case, I need you to read this.
And I need you to wear this.
I'm sorry, one more time.
Heh. Stop joking. Tell him your name.
I am so very sorry! I don't know what has gotten into that...
No! Nooo!
Okay, I admit it, I'm a fraud! This was all a futile, pathetic attempt to impress you. This isn't really my restaurant. I'm just a cashier!
Is that true?
Oh, the usual.  Would you get out of here!?
SpongeBob!
I'm not wearing your hat on my nose, I'm waiting for #17's order!
Hilarious. Just deliver the food.
That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen?
How did you...?
Umm... yeah, sure.
Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?
It was rated "R."  Arr! Because it's... about... pirates.
There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you...
SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!
No, wait, SpongeBob!
Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?
Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?
I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy!
Not the Navy!  Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world!  Our world!  What do we do now?
SpongeBob.
We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how?
They poop on the robot?
I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop! How To Torture
Shut up!
I said "shut up!", you bucket of bolts!
SpongeBob, are you okay?
No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs.
And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know.
SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first.
SpongeBob, let me handle this.  Where's Mr. Krabs?
We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?
Where's Mr. Krabs?
We don't think; we know.
He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.
SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender.
Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.
We're just gonna see what your "little buddy" knows.
Where's Mr. Krabs?  Not talking, eh?
Go get the toaster.
I thought you said robots can't cry.
SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?
Uhh
