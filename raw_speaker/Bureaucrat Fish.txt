Mr. Eugene Krabs and Sheldon Plankton...
These are for you.
The Krusty Krab and The Chum Bucket are located too close together. One of your restaurants is going to have to be bulldozed.
That's for you two to decide.
Gentlemen you have 24 hours to decide which of you moves. That's the law around here!
So, who's getting bulldozed today?
The people have spoken. Step aside, Mr. Krabs.
Please comply, Mr. Krabs. It'll be quick and painless.
Okay, now this is really your last chance.
Fine. Have it your way.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Demolition is outside of my prevue. I simply insure that restaurants comply with the 100 foot ordinance.  That's 1 more foot. Perfect!
No...
