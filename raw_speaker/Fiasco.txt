Mustard!
Like our own fleating existence, an untimely end has come upon this krabby-valued meal.
Such artistic genius!  I'll never paint again!
Ahem! Squid... ward... go toward... the light...  of my flamethrower!
Yes! That's just what it needed! I'll call the painting, "One Hole!" Oh, it's genius!
Ugh! Three holes?! That makes no sense!
