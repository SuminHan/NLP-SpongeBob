So, here's my number if you want to talk about...  Hello?
Your... what?
Uh... hummm... I don't have a guitar.
Pretty much. My mom gave me this one for my birthday.
Yeah. I wanted a guitar or a star named after me... but you know, whatever. I guess a TV show is cool.
Hey, hey, hey, Bikini Bottom. Are you ready to party Squidward style?  Thank you for making us number one because I was finally able to get...  ...a new guitar! Thanks, Squidward!  Let's party!
