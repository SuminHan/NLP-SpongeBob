Who, Strangler?
Oh, yeah, he's going to jail for a long time.
Don't worry, SpongeBob. He won't be able to strangle you.
Oops, not again.
We ain't bodyguards, kid.
Stay off our beat. This is your final warning.
Put that muddy shovel in the trunk and we'll give you a ride back.
You ok there, little fella?
He's acting a little funny.
I want a soda.
Hey, there's no ice!
I'll get it myself. Ice is in the freezer, right?
Step aside. You people act like you've committed a murder.
What are you two talking about?
You mean in here?
Is this some kind of a joke?
Say, maybe he turned into a zombie and walked out.
I'll take it from here.  Die, zombie!
We're gonna straighten you out!
Barnacles, did you see that?!
Freeze, you're under arrest!
We're not talking about him.
