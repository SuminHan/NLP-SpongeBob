Stop that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That's exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!
There's no room for "but"s in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He's trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing, and I mean nothing to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?
Good! Now move out!
