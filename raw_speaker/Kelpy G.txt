Ah... salutation, my children. Are you ready for your daily dose of smooth jazz?
Another show, another intermission.
Hold on a smooth second.
No, no. I agree. The clarinet sound abysmal, but that ukelele. Genius. And his clogs. They're just like mine, see? Excuse me, young man.
And what might you be called?
Come, young protege, let us woo the crowd with sounds of heavenly delight.  At this time, I'd like to welcome a very special guest to the stage Mr. SpongeBob SmoothPants.
