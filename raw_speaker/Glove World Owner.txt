Here son, take this. You don't wanna get cold.
Well, enjoy that hat. Now if you'll folks will excuse me, I have a rickety old theme park to close down.
Yep.
I understand you're concern, but really...
Well, seeing it's our last day of operation, anyway and it's long as the two of you pay the full admission price, sure go right ahead!
I'm sorry you're feeled that way but if we were accommodate every employee-
Great! Now where am I gonna find another mascot?
Well sure, why not? I mean what could go wrong?
What are you doing?
Well I hope you don't plan on staying chain for long. Or you'll miss the big grand opening tonight.
The grand opening. The only reason we're closing down Glove World!, it's because Glove Universe is opening tonight. See for yourself.
Isn't she something?  Well, you two have a good night.
