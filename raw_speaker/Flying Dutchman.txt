Har, har har har har har har har har har!
Eugene Krabs, your time has come.
Oh, sorry. I must have the wrong room.  Excuse me, nurse?
I'm looking for Eugene Krabs.
No, that's Harold Flower's room.
So, Krabs, you thought you could fool the Flying Dutchman?
I'm here to escort you to the resting place of all bad undersea folk: Davy Jones' locker!
Ah, but you were cheap, and being cheap is a terrible thing. Next stop, Davy Jones' locker!  Here we are.
Davy Jones works out a lot.  These are his socks. Get in!
Come on, Krabs, show a little dignity.
Alright, alright, stop your crying. I'll give you another chance, but you must always be generous, never cheap.
A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker...
Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?
He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.
You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?
62 cents.
Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents.  Next stop: Davy Jones' locker!
Here, take him back.
Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds.  And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!
He's your problem now.
Dutchman's residence.
Curse this cursed, ghostly fog. I can barely see past me own nose.  Urrgh!   Arrgh!  Me ship.  Hello, Roadside Assistance? I've got a bit of a flat! My location where I'll be staying? Business or residence?  Residence.  Argh!
I'm stuck here while my ship is being repaired. Until then, I'm here to haunt ya!
Aw, I just wanted to pet the little guy.  There, there. Dutchie's not gonna hurt ya. I love me a good snail.
Nothing better than giving a good scare! Argh!
Don't get too comfortable!
Hmm?  Hmm?
Why aren't you freakin' out, lad?
What are you trying to say?
I know when I'm washed up. I've been doing the same material for years! Scaring is a young man's game. It's time to give up the ghost; no pun intended.
Don't lie to me!
Hmm...
Grr!  Raargh! Raargh! Move! Raargh!  Ah, forget it.
It's official; I'm not scary anymore.
Maybe I just need a break. Take some time off, you know?
Maybe stay with a friend for a while. On a comfy couch in a pineapple. Just for a little while longer? 'Til I get back on my feet?
Who'd guess we have so much in common? You like teddy bears; I like teddy bears. You like ponies; I like ponies!
Oh, this? Oh, it's nothing.
Come on, SpongeBob, don't be a stick in the mud!
Even better the third time.
Alrighty, boys, party's over.  Time to scoot honey.
Well, it is comfy.
Ah, you're right, SpongeBob. I'm pathetic.
What in barnacles is it?
That was beautiful!
What are you kidding me? Scaring her is too easy.
No problemo, compadre.  Yargh!
What? No! 'Tis I, the ominous Flying Dutchman!
Let's hit it.
Ah. It's no use, SpongeBob. I can't seem to scare anyone. Maybe people just don't believe in ghosts anymore.
I heard you don't believe in ghosts!
As in the Flying Dutchman!
No such thing as ghosts? No such thing as ghosts?! You don't believe in ghosts?!
Ooh, scary!
And me confidence, too. Now I feel like I can scare the living criminy out of anybody! All thanks to you, my boy.
Actually, I have a confession, SpongeBob. My ship's been done for three months now. Well, it was nice roomin' with ya.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I left you a little something something for all your trouble. Now, it's time for me to ruin more souls.
Anything?
That's right. 'Tis I, the ominous Flying Dutchman. I'll grant your wish but it'll cost you.
Wha...? Well, uh, great. But be warned!
Humph, you're no fun at all, you know that?
All sales are final from the Flying Dutchman, especially for a selfish shellfish like yourself. Try saying that three times fast. Your soul's going into me fanny pack of despair.  Now pay up. Huh?  An I.O.U. ?
What? To who?
You too, SpongeBob?
Ow!
Well, normally, I wouldn't mind, but I'm a little low on cash this month, so I have no way to pay for more. Unless you have some money I can borrow.
Ya promise?
Liar!!!
Your Aunt Sally doesn't wear false teeth!
Because I dated her in high school!
Whoops!
And now, just to make sure this never happens again, I'm gonna send you on a little trip down the-  -Ooh ow, ooh ow! Ooh! Ooh!
Oh, what the... a gym sock? But that means...
Enough!
You bet your white lily livers I'm the Flying Dutchman. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. I'm going to steal your souls.  Quiet!  You had it coming, you little crybabies. Every year, people dressing up like me.  Turning the Flying Dutchman name in a laughingstock. But that's not the reason I'm taking your souls.  No, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. Out of all the Dutchman costumes I've seen, yours is the most insulting.
You? Scary?!  Let me tell you about scary, kid. There's all kinds of scary things in the world. Spiders are scary, uhh, I'm scary. You, you're not scary. Okay, let's get this over with.
First, I got to get rid of this stupid costume.
Avast!
Heave to... and prepare to be boarded by the Flying Dutchman!
Avast there, you scurvy thieving barnacle bass!
So, it be me old first mate who stole me gold and me crew!
Um, that was 300 years ago!
Me booty! Well, maybe I misjudged you fellas! I'm sorry I was so cross with ya!  Why, you treacherous sea devils! When I'm done with you, you...  Okay, now I'm a little bit peeved!
Don't go anywhere, kiddies! Cause you're about to be cursed like you've never been cursed before!
Observe!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
I'm the Flying Dutchman.
I'm the Flying Dutchman.  Who dares wake the Flying Dutchman? Keep it down will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep.
Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure?
Arrgh! So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!
Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.
Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble.
Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest.
Did somebody say knot?
So, you want to tie knots, do ya? Well, do ya?!
Then you've come to the right flying ghost, kid. You're looking at the first place winner in the fancy knottin' contest for the last 3,000 years!
You're gonna have to not do that. And stop staring at me with them big old eyes.  Now, stand back and watch me be .  Haha! Behold!  The pretzel knot!
The double diamond knot!  The square knot!  The constrictor!  The gut knot!  The pillow knot.  The butterfly knot.
Wait, There's more!  The monkey chain!  The monkey's fist!  The monkey!
This one here's a loop knot, otherwise known as the 'poop loop'.
I don't know how to tie me shoes. I haven't worn shoes for over 5,000 years!  But sometimes I like to wear this little sock over me ghostly tail.
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... You are it!
Thou wish is granted.
Ahh, minty.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and... You are it!
So be it.
Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner
Argh! Who be disturbing the Flying Dutchman's walk home from the convenience store? You even spilled me milk!
Your aunt Sally doesn't wear false teeth!
Because I dated her in high school!
I'm gonna ship you off...
Rawr!!
I am the Flying Dutchman!
Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?
Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
You're next!
Welcome back!
Welcome back!
So, are you gonna try that again?
How 'bout now?
Now listen.  Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever!  And, uhh , ever.
Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.
Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?
Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck!
Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
Get moving!
What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear!
Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!
Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.
All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal.
Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!
With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!
Get back on the ship.
Yes, but they're my dorks.
I've been thinking. Stop bouncing!  This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner!
Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen...  Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!
Ok, then...  Give it to me!
Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!
Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.
Four.
Ok...uhh, three. You get three wishes.
Okay, you got two wishes left.
That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish.  Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...
You are it!
Thou wish is granted.
Ahh, minty.
You are it!
So be it.
Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner
You are it!
Hey, I get a wish too. Fruit prevents scurvy!  Hey, get back here with that!
