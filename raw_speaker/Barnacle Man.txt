That's Barnacle Boy, I mean, man! I... Ohh...forget it, people. If you're not going to give me the respect I want as a hero, then maybe you'll give me respect as a villain. A villain who is...evil.
I am crossing over...to the dark side!
Nighty night, you old goat!
Barnacle Man!
Shh!
You might as well give up, Mermaid Man, because there are three of us and only one of you. You don't stand a chance.
Captain Magma!
Oh, there goes our toy deal.
Oh no, please, mercy!
We did it, we won! This day belongs to E.V.I.L.!  You've lost Mermaid Man, and the superhero and super-villain rules say you have to give in to my demands.
Number one, I want to be treated like a superhero, not a sidekick. Number two, I want to be called Barnacle Man. And number three...
I want an adult-sized Krabby Patty.
Need a hand, superpal?
Actually, it's pretty big. I'm not sure if I can finish the whole thing.
