Hey, get off my lawn! Party?  There ain't no party here! Go away!
Hush, Potty, can't you see I'm trying to keep out the riffraff?
Oh, of course it is! I was just fooling! Welcome! Say, you didn't bring SpongeBob with you, did you? I sure hope he got his invitation.
Ah well, come on in. Let me introduce you around. This here's Minnie Mermaid. She's cooling off on account of she's been dancing her scales off, isn't that right, Minnie, huh, takin' a little breakie poo?
Ha, ha, that's the spirit!
Huh, let's see, who else haven't you met? That's Longbeard the pirate. Hey, there Longbeard, long time no see!
Sorry about that, Neppy. That's Neptune. He's king of the sea.
You kids having fun?  He he.. whew! Hosting a party is hard work alright. That reminds me of a time when SpongeBob was hosting a party! Hey, you kids want to see that cartoon?  You do? Well then, launch the cartoon!
Ha, ha! Looks like it's smooth party sailing for SpongeBob so far. Now it's time for me to get my own party underway! Gather around, ye scurvy landlubbers, it's time to learn the peg legged dance o' happiness.  Oh, it's quite simple really, all you need is a peg leg and some patience. And my instructional video series, only $29.95.
It's a $40 value, Potty!  A $40 value! Now, it's very easy and loads of fun.
Band? What band?
A jolly idea, Potty. A little live musical get me shindig dug. Who'd you get? Barnacle Bill and the Seven Seas?
Seaweed Sally and her cackling turtle?
Oh, oh, I know: The First Mates.
Salt Water Sam, featuring the Brine Brothers.
Rusty hinges and the Boys from the Brig?
Well, who else is there?
Oh.. ha he huh?
But they're just a bunch of birds!
Potty, that's the worst sea shanty I've ever heard! I certainly hope it doesn't get any louder. Ooooooohh!
No, no, no! Stop the music!  Look boys, I know that you fellas sound good around the birdbath, but this here is basic cable! This is the big time. I'm afraid it's time for you to walk the plank.
No.  Go on, start jumping, or you'll be dealing with the business end of me sword! Ha ha ha...  No! I forgot that you're birds! Ahh!
Oh ho ho, I'm glad to see that old SpongeBob's party worked out. Now I gotta get me own party going! Ready for some real music, Potty?
Oh... scurvy ain't for the likes of me, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho... Oh! Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho, yo ho.. Oh, scurvy ain't for the likes of..
Thank you, Potty, I almost forgot... wait a minute, I don't play a flute, I play a fife.   Potty, no!  Wow, I can't believe I survived that one.  Potty, help me!
Aha! Great job, boys! Thanks for stopping by! Don't hit the porthole on the way out.  And thank you for stopping by! You've made this party a real fun time.
Oh! Ladies! Shiver me timbers! Welcome, girlies!  Huh! No!
It's Potty you're after!
Yee-ha! Hey kids! Now, you're probably wondering, "Hmm, what's Patchy doing in a cave?" good question, you little  Well, it's because today's SpongeBob takes place in prehistoric times  back when man struggled for survival  and dinosaurs ruled the Earth.  Isn't that right, Bronty? But I'm riding YOU now!  It's stuck.  Like I was saying, prehistoric times were the greatest.  It was a simpler time  with simpler pleasures!  Your clothes always match!  You can draw on the walls! And nobody yell at ya!  It was much easier to hit a baseball!  Oh yeah, prehistoric times were the best.  Hey kids! Are those pterodactyl wings I hear 'a flappin'? I think I know who that is! Please welcome the Potty-dactyl!
Potty! Why aren't you wearing your costume?  I stayed up all night making it!
What?!  That's not true! Don't mind him, folks. Why even SpongeBob SquarePants knows that prehistoric stuff is, what the kids say,  cool.
Yes he does.
He most certainly does.
Yes he does!
I know for a fact that he does!
Does.
Does.
Does.
Does! Uh, look, while we're arguing, why don't you folks go ahead and watch some prehistoric SpongeBob! Roll the cartoon! does.
I told you prehistoric times were fun! Hey! How's about I teach you kids how a caveman makes a fire with  two sticks?  Yeah Doesn't get any cooler than that, huh? Chalk one up for Patchy!  Rubbing  I guess this is a type of wood that doesn't burn.  Potty!
Well, I have something that you'll never find in your little  future: a real live caveman. Hmm  Hey, there he is! Come on in, little troglodyte fella. Come on  You see kids, I found him frozen in a block of ice and then I spent three days thawing him out with my mom's hair dryer. I call him Cavey.  Isn't he something? It's OK, Cavey.
Where do you keep getting all this stuff?
Potty!! You're ruining me caveman show!
Ahoy, glad you're back.  Let's watch the rest of SpongeBob B.C. while I get things straightened out around here. Whoa!  Or maybe not.
Now I know how Squidward feels
I think you know perfectly well, you little winged vermin. All I wanted was to show the nice people how great the cavemen were. But all they got was technology-induced chaos!
You got rid of the robot android cyborg?!
Potty, I guess I really misjudged you  What the-?!!
Well Potty, I guess you were right. The future is cool.
Ooh! What is it? A new loincloth?
An enlarged forehead?
Aww, what is it?  Potty!!!
Well, thanks for watching SpongeBob B.C. kids.  Bye!  Now he's tickling!  Cut it out, you rascal!
Wah!  Hot! Hot! Hot! Potty, don't you know this is Patchy private time?  Oh, hello! Dahh!  What are you all doing here?
But I haven't got the lost episode because I... well, I lost it!
But it is! It's lost and I have no idea where it is, so it's best if you forget all about old SpongeBob.
I don't believe I lost the Lost Episode.  I never lose anything.
Well, yeah, but...
Well, the eye, I...
And the h... oh, get out of here you blasted bird!  Hmm... if only I had a map to tell me where the Lost Episode is.
Hey... it's a map! It's a map to the Lost Episode of SpongeBob I lost!
We gotta go find it, Potty!  Oh, first I'll need me treasure hunting leg.  Come on, Potty! Ah! Times a-wastin'!
Ten paces past Mrs. Johnson's house.
Put 'em in a doggie bag, Mrs. Johnson. Can't right now, we're on a treasure hunt.
Walk five fathoms past Don's Import Store and Delicatessen.  Half a league to the forked tree.  Oh!  Now all that's left is... Huh?! The seven trials of monkey lagoon?!  Merciful Neptune. Only for SpongeBob. Only for SpongeBob!  Whoa!  Whoa! Whoa!  Ow!  Ahh... Ahh... Ah!  We made it! We survived the trials! Oh, I'm really gonna dig this lost episode!  Dig it, get it?
And I just got out of the shower.  Hey Potty, I think I hit something.  Clever... bury your treasure above the surface.
This is it!  I don't know what it means either.  But I got what I came for! Come on Potty, time's a-wastin'.  Yeah! Popcorn.  Soda.  Pickled garlic!  Potty, hit the remote!
This is gonna be great!  I can't believe it. More SpongeBob!  This is so exciting!  Here it comes!
That's it? That's the Lost Episode? That was just a bunch of cheap walk cycles!
Grrrrr...  SpongeBob betrayed us?!  I'm sorry I ever started this stupid fan club in the first place!  I'm gonna get rid of all my SpongeBob stuff! All of it! All of it!  All of it!  I'm gonna run away, that's what I'll do! Run away!
Really?  Hooray! Let's watch!
Hey,kids! Potty and I took jobs as fry cooks so we could be just like our hero SpongeBob SquarePants!
Potty, don't you have some dishes to wash?
Hey, kids! Say hello to my boss, Mr. Pirateson.
One order of scurvy fries, one large bilge water.
Oh, I'm sorry. Diet bilge water. Better get on it sir.  Owwwwwww!
Oh, Potty, you're just in time to see me new pirate patties. I call this one "Buried Treasure".
I call this one "Walk the Plank".
This'll blow out your old bird brain of yours. Behold! The Patchy Patty!
Potty the Parrot, you are never supported of me! I don't wanna be your friend anymore! I never wanna see you again!
You know kids this isn't the first time a perfect patty's come between two good friends.
It happened once in Bikini Bottom.
Here, take a look while I pull myself together.
I miss Potty. I remember the first time we met.  If I could only hear his voice.
Potty! You came back to apologize!
Hey, you can't tell me what to do you... Huh? Assistant manager? How did you become assistant manager?
Oh, here we go again with the fancy booklearnin'. Customers love me cookin. Why, we're almost out of doggie bags.
Oh Potty, what am I doing wrong?
Ahh, me patty's done.
Oh, Fine. I'll eat it!  Oh, for the crime of foaling me taste buds, I order you to walk the plank!  Ah. Oh well, I bet SpongeBob's first patty didn't go so well either.
Oooooh, I'll make a Potty Patty out of you!
Well, that's what gives it its special flavor.
Oh, I brush and shampoo them daily. Who's Patchy's little princess?  Owwwwwwwww! Mmmmmm! Don't do that!
What? Everytime?
What kind of a pirate wears a hairnet?
Well, you'll never know, Potty. I might get lucky. You hear that, ladies? Patchy's available. Huh?
That's it, you feathered snake! This time you gone too far!
Yes, Mr. Pirateson.  You kids watch the rest of the cartoon, while I watch Potty get fired.
Coming, Mr. Pirateson, sir.
Ohh, that Plankton never learns does he kids. As for me I decited to take some time off to catch up on me reading.
Hey, you got fired, too!
Well, at least I know they won't ever be able to replace me.
What? They let a smelly, hairy, flea bag like that serve food?
Shh!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Hey, watch it, I have a tomato allergy! Hey, watch the butt!
Let's go!  Hey, kids. Rush hour traffic here in Encino is really bad. A little music should calm my jangled nerve. At least my dash-in hi-fi still works.  Me ultra-rare Frampton Comes Alive 8-track destroyed!  And I'm gonna miss the new SpongeBob cartoon if this traffic doesn't move soon!  Who's calling? Yes, Patchy here. Start squawking.
Stuck on the 101. Be a dear and record it for me, will you?
You what?!
Potty, you know how important this cartoon is to me!  Do you mind? I'm trying to talk to my parrot!  Sorry, Potty. Just some land lubber.  Potty?  Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Guah. Dropped again.  Curse this traffic!  Oooooh!  Arrrrrrr, home at last. What the...?  Encino... it's gone. NO...!!!  You know, kids, this reminds Patchy of an old story. Another story of a lost city. Why don't you go check it out? Oh, Encino.
Well, bad news, kids. Encino's still lost.  Oh! But, at least I got me radio fixed!  Well, enjoy the rest of the show.
This is the end of patchy. No water, no food, and still no Encino. And here come the vultures the pick me bones!  Shiver me timbers! It's potty! I wonder what parrot tastes like... Come back here! Uh-oh. Here come the hallucinations.
But, Encino is gone.
Believe, believe.  Welcome to Encino! It's back!  SpongeBob was right! All I had to do was believe.
Ow! Ow! It was all a hallucination. Encino's still gone!  Oooooo, a sandwich. Potty, you're a lifesaver.  Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Oh, potty, you know I don't like mayo!  Here you want some? Go on. Take it. You know, I don't like the mayonnaise, you know. You know, when it gets above 130, 135, it gets kind of grody, you know.
Well, pretty good story, Eh, kids?  I found Encino.  But, it's all tiny. Somebody must have...
No, no, no, no! I want Encino full size again! There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
Beardy? Well, Look's like everything's back to the right size, eh, Potty?  Potty?
Ow! Well, kids, I'm a little busy right now, but, be sure to come back real soon for more of your old pal Patchy. Ow! And some more SpongeBob SquarePants. Potty, will you get off of me!
Yes. This is Patchy the Pirate for SpongeBob SquarePants. I believe he's expecting me. I sent him over 400 letters...this week.
That's okay. I can wait.  SpongeBob?!
Aw, poop deck. I was hoping I could ask SpongeBob to phone up some of his famous friends so he could ask them to be guests on my show.
Yeah.
Woo! Oh hey, when'll SpongeBob be here? Whe're's he? At lunch?  At an important meeting?
Getting his boat waxed?
What's he really like?
Does he come in everyday?
Does he dye his hair?
Huh?
Security, more shrimp cocktail in Casting, please. Thank you.
Yeah, good point.
Yeah. No. I mean...
I shall.  Let's see, Dawson, Richard. Rosario. Rosario Dawson! She'll bring a little class to the show.
Uh, hello, Rosario.
It's Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob
Fan Club. I'm throwing a little TV
show-tacular, and I need a little celebrity wind in my sail, so to speak.
I was wondering if you'd like to be my special guest.
Of course, silly. We'll be working closely together all day.
Well, back to the old Rolodex. Uh, Bo Derek. Bo Diddly. Eddie Deezen. Eddie Deezen?
Ooh. This will be good.
Ahoy, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.
This is Patchy the Pirate.
You know, I do get that a lot, but seriously, it's not Johnny Depp.
The one from Encino. It's Patchy, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club.
It's Patchy
What?
None of the above. I was wondering if you'd like to be a guest on the big TV special. That I am throwing for SpongeBob.
It would sure mean a lot to be personally if you'd be on my show, Triumph.
Oh.
Well, fine. Who needs you, you filthy mongrel?
Great! So, you'll be on my show?
Oh, yeah, well, I'll have you know, you are not the biggest star to tell me that. Hello? Hello?
Hey, LeBron, how's the Dribbling?
How would you, LeBron James, like to be a guest on the fan clubmongorical special for SpongeBob?
Oh, Come on! The season's hardly even started yet.
Oh, they won't care if you miss one game, will they?
Oh, contract  schmontract.  We have party gifts.
Oh!  This casting business is harder than 40 years of barnacle buildup.  Okay, time to get serious.
Ahoy, Tina.
Patchy... the pirate.
Hey, listen, us bad soul sistas have to stick  together, huh?
Great, 'cause I'm throwing a huge telestravaganza for SpongeBob SquarePants and I'd love it if you'd come down and sing a song for us.
Aren't you the modest one? Well, SpongeBob, for one, will be on the show.
Who?
That's right. The little sponge is the guest of honor.
Listen, Miss Turner, you let me handle the guests. You stick to your singing and dancing.
Who?
Hello? Hello, Tina? You'd better be good to me.
Hey, Will, it's Patchy the pirate,  president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club  in Encino, and I'm throwing a little TV special for him.
What?! You can't do that!
Doubt it. Who are your guests?
Hang on to your hat. Sir Quentin and Mr. Tinder. Ever heard of 'em?
Of course, silly.
20th anniversary...
Hey,  I went to Blackbeard Polytechnic with this guy. He has to be on my show, according to pirates' code.
Is this Captain Craig, son of Fergu?
How's me old Blackbeard College Roommate?
List, Fergulicious. I was hoping I could get you to appear on my SpongeBob Fan Club tenth year anniversary show tonight.
Oh, you have to. It's in  the pirates' code.
Argh!
Arrr!
Oh, no. I'm not gonna go there. 'Cause I see how it is, Mr. Big Shot, Mr. TV. No time for your old pirate school buddies anymore.
Oh, great. So, how's on your big fancy-schmancy TV show Tonight?
Robin Williams?!  Go to go, Fergo.
Thanks for the tip, Ferguson.
Mr. Williams. How are...?
So, are you-ho-ho, here for the show?
This way.
I never heard of him.  ...Go.
Keep up, Mr. Williams. Pagey, Pagey the Pirate
Oh, Mr. Williams, that's not for you.
You've signed all the releases and everything?
Oh, it's the part, that... We're on our way to the green room.
Don't you worry, Mr. Williams.
Oh, it's its a new way.
Oh, sure.
Oh, and Mr. Williams I...
It's okay.  I'll just wait out here.
Mr. Williams,  everything okay on the poop deck?
Okay.
Everything okay Mr. Williams?
All righty.
Time is money.  Everything all right in there?
I'm sorry, I don't want to be late for the show, Mr. Williams.
Go that way.
Go that way.
That way.
Oh, just a place I know of.
Oh, abduction?
Abduction?
Right this way, Mr. Williams.
The Green Room.
'Cause its green.  There you go, right there.  Sit down. I'm gonna to get more celebrities, okay?
Don't Try to escape! I mean... enjoy our hospitality.   Who else you got, Ferguson?!
 Ten years   of Sponge... 
What? Potty,   where are ya?
I can't hear you.
"Cue"? What does that mean?
What are you pointing at   me for?  You have a headache?   Anyhoo, can you believe it, kids? It's been ten years since I started the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club. And he's here in person. I'm finally gonna meet me idol. Let's bring him out now.   Nobody cares.   Without  further ado, please welcome SpongeBob SquarePants.  Without further ado, please welcome SpongeBob SquarePants.
What?! What do you mean he's not coming?! Ten years I've been presidentin' his fan club.  He never answered any of my letters.  He never showed up to any of my charity luncheons.  Now I throw him a television extravaganza, and he can't even be bothered to show up?!  Well, we'll just see about that!   You  want a piece of me, well, you're going to get one.  Think you can spurn my advances, eh? I've been a fan since the beginning. Ten...Oh!  Oh, you...
Hey!
there it is.  I'm coming for ya, SquarePants.
Well, kids, this was supposed to be the part of the show where SpongeBob and I were gonna watch old outtakes  and rejected scenes and talk about 'em.  But he never showed up! And now I'm stuck in the belly of a whale! Oh, well. We already paid for the airtime, so here they are.  Hello, children. You know, like any great work of art, SpongeBob did not just appear out of nowhere. He started out as a thought.  The he evolved into  a primitive rendering... And along the way  to becoming the sponge we all know and love,  he went through many different changes. And phases and phanges.  And pain can be very painful. For instance,  did you know that SpongeBob was not the first choice to star in the show?  Hard to believe, I know. Watch these opening themes, and you'll see why he was eventually picked.
Next!
No!
Ugh. Pretty cruddy, huh, kids? Here's a really old clip of SpongeBob. Back then, cartoons were called flickering funnies.
Oh, you.  You little scalawag.  Hey, kids. Just having some technical difficulties.  Oh! Oh. don't sneeze. don't sneeze.
Oh... Ooh...  Huh! There is is! SpongeBob's house! Oh, I finally get to meet me hero!  Whoo!
SpongeBob?
How'd I get here? Where's SpongeBob? Ah, who am I kidding? I'm never going to see SpongeBob.
I know. SpongeBob.
Merry Christmas, kids! I bet you're wondering why ol' Patchy has this mail truck. Well, this year, I wanted to be absolutely sure Santa got me letter. So I gave Mr. Mailman the day off.
Oh, Potty, you silly parrot. Everyone knows that the directions to the North Pole are in the lyrics of the song "Jingle Bells." Dashing through the snow, in a... Through the fields we go. La la la la la. Okay. So we're looking for some fields here.
Yeah, well, we ain't turnin' till we see some fields.
I don't see no fork.
While we wait for the truck to stop spinning, let's see what SpongeBob is up to this Christmas.
I can't believe we survived that horrifying car accident without a scratch.  Ow!  Aw, here's the problem. Oh, that's not good. Flat tire, huh? Looks as sad as an empty bag of beef. Brrr! It's cold up here. Why don't you kids at home go make a nice hot cup of cocoa while Potty builds me a fire?
Hello, kiddies. It's so cold, me eye patch cracked. There hasn't been any food or water, food or food for over 20 minutes. Boy, I could sure go for some buffalo wings right about now. Sounds good. Eh, Potty?  With a side of blue cheese dressing.
I'm sorry, Potty, I don't know what got into me. I'm just so hungry!
Why are you looking at me like that, bird?  What are you doing?
Santa's workshop? I'm here, Santa! I'm here!
Santa! There's only thing I wants for Christmas! And it's to meet me hero, SpongeBob SquarePants.
Yo ho ho, yo ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho ho.  Oh! Hi.  I'm Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club!  Hey, that's better!
That's right, Potty! It is Christmas.  And there ain't nothing better in the seven seas than a Bikini Bottom Christmas. It sure is a magical time of year.  Why, I'll bet old SpongeBob is gearing up for Santa Claus right now!
Not bad for a creature with no vertebrae.  And I'm sure our pal Patrick is doing his share of the decorating.  I too am also preparing for Christmas.  Hmm, unbaked cookie dough!  Mmm...
Potty! No!
Get out of here!
Potty!
Back off, you flying freak!
This here cookie dough is for the children, not for pesky parrots.  What's that? Three bells! Well, we all know what three bells means!
No, you silly livers!  No!
You, I'm ignoring.  No, it means it's time to open fan letters!
Thank you, Potty.  Yeah. Okay Potty, thank you!  Come on, give it, you birdbrain!  Quiet, infernal bird!  Hmm.  This letter comes to us from...
And he writes, "Dear SpongeBob, I am ten years old, and I was wondering if you like Christmas as much as I do. Sincerely yours..."
A very good question. But you know they didn't always celebrate Christmas in Bikini Bottom.
No sir, my fine feathered little neck pain.  There was a time when no one had even heard of Christmas in Bikini Bottom.  Hey! Who wants to hear the story of SpongeBob's very first Christmas?  Potty?!  You ate all me cookie dough!
Oh well! On with the show!
And so, Sandy wove the magical tale of gumdrops and pennywhistles. She told of toy-making elves and flying reindeer. But best of all, she told of the one they call, Santa Claus.
Is Squidward right? Can there be a Christmas under the sea? Stay tuned!  It's about time you got back! Now I can finish me story! So, SpongeBob was sending the last of the letters to Santa...
Dee dee, dee dee dee dee.  Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island!  Presents, ahoy!  Hooray!  Oh, a storm!  Yay! I mean yikes!  Oh, we're going down!  Trim the sails! Hoist the yardarms! Turn on the Weather Channel!
Oh, hi kids. Boy, that SpongeBob makes me as jolly as a roger. Well, I hope you enjoyed SpongeBob's Christmas tale. And I hope your Christmas is better than sunken treasure.  Aw... Potty left me a little Christmas present.  Arr, ye old mistletoe. And you know what that means.  Ah, time for somebody to kiss Patchy the Pirate!  Come on, who's it gonna be? Come on! Kiss the captain!
No! No, not you!  No, not you Potty! Get out of here! No, Potty! I don't wanna kiss you! No, we talked about this! Potty! No!
Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to me quarters. Why don't come on back on the galley, I'm cooking up a little treat for you today. It's call-in-and-vote time. You get to choose how our cartoon ends today, via the phone, or the Internet if your technologically inclined. Now this cartoon is different from most cartoons in that-
Well, If it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh... Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Were'd you go? Potty, you in here, buddy?
Get me out of here, you scurvy bird!  Now, what was I saying? Now this cartoon ain't like most of your "land-lobbing cartoons". This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to call the number their that's scrolling at the bottom of the screen...  No, not now! Don't call 'till I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because-  Your not gonna make this easy are ya. Quiet! Vast their! Be laze that ringing! Stop! Its driving me mad!
Well, that's our cartoon so far. Now its time for you to decide how it ends! Who will get the last wish? Will it be, Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good 'Ol SpongeBob.  My trusty crew, is eagerly awaiting your call. So, hoist your anchor of that couch, and make with the voting! This is your big chance, And we'll be right back to announce, the winner!  Ahoy children, I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls got your votes in, because its time for you to walk the plank!  Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time to announce the winner!  But first, let's look at the endings you didn't choose. According to our high tech counter ology, You didn't choose, Patrick.  But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him. OK! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the- oh gaw!
Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Molarchy! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh!  It appears you didn't vote for Squidward. I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either! But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Eeny-Minie-Mo finger landed on Squidward!
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because its time to announce, the winner! The envelope please Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well what do you know? The winner is, SpongeBob!  Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!
And now, the most requested ending! Hooray!
Hold on! Sorry about that kids! Its just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lobbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now your an official big time cartoon decision maker!  Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks Potty! Potty!
Ohhh! Oh, that's it folks! Right now I got a little employee management to take care of! Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage! Potty I'm not kidding!
OW!
