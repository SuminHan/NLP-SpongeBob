That... was your first lesson.
Just keep breathing.
Just... keep breathing.
You obviously didn't stare into the fire all night like your friends over there.
Those dudes are gonna make awesome surfers.
Uh...
These clouds. They can only mean one thing.
Yes. Every thousand years or so, the planets align in such a way that a perfect wave is formed.
The world's biggest, fastest, longest, gnarliest, most totally awesome, perfect wave. They call it.... the Big One.
It's probably the only wave big enough for you to ride all the way back to Bikini Bottom. And you'll have to catch it, or you'll be stuck here... forever.  The Big One is almost upon us.
Get ready, dudes. It's coming.
Little dude, I didn't teach you anything you didn't already know.
Wait. There's something I forgot to tell you. In return for its awesomeness, the Big One always demands a sacrifice. One of you... will not return.
Looking for this?
Little dude,... I was born to do this.
Just keep breathing.
