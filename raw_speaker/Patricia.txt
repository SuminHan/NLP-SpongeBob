Bye.
Uhh, thank you, Squidward.
Excuse me, Squidward.
Forty... thirty...
Mr. Krabs, you ordered two Krusty meals?
Okay.
No, that's the night SpongeBob and I are having a staring contest.
Well, I can't. SpongeBob and I will be flying submarines that night. I have to get back to Krusting the Krab.  Man, why are those two so nice to me? They were never this nice to Patrick. It's weird.
Persistent bunch.
No thanks, again!
I said no.  No.  No way.  No.  No.  NO!  What is it about me that makes those two so friendly? It must have something to do with this disguise. I can't wear this any longer.
Well I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I just can't live like this anymore. I'm tired of pretending to be someone I'm not.
I have an announcement to make. The entire day that I've worked here I've wanted to say...  Um-um-um-uh...  I've wanted to say that, uhh, th-that...  That I will eat any leftovers on your plate!
I'll be right there, sir.
That's the guy with the briefcase. The guy who's trying to run me out of town.
What can I get you, sir?
NO!
He's on to us.
Well, I guess I don't need this disguise anymore.
