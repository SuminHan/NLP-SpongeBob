That's all very wonderful, but do you mind telling me how you intend to pay for the damage to the bank?
Not so fast, Krabs. Looks like you have just enough in your bank account to cover the cost.
Umm, you're facing the wrong way, sir.
Will that be from your savings or your checking account, sir?
May I please see some identification?
Thank you.  Sir, we are showing a balance of $0.00 for both of your accounts.
Next!
