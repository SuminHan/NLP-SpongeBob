Okay.
No. I guess I'm just this idiot.
Why, it's beautiful.
Ah, it's a plus one.
It's not "ploos oh-nay." It says "plus one"!
Well, when you get an invitation to a party, sometimes they put "plus one" on it, to tell you it's okay to bring along a friend.
Well, no, you could go alone. It's just that everyone will laugh at you 'cause they think you're a friendless loser.
And then you just initial there and we're all set.
Not in the face!
Actually, I'm not a kidder. I'm much more of an introvert.
You are?
Yeah, I don't know. I'm just a regular guy. But in not being a mailman, I love going to fancy art galleries.
And eating delicious food.
Right? And if there's one thing I hate, it's...
Clarinets!
I mean what kind of maniac could enjoy the sound of a clarinet? That squeaky hollow kind of piercing howl from the very pits of Gehenna. Only a deluded blow-hog, with nothing to lose, could pick up a  clarinet and think "Yeah! This is for me! Let me inflict this pain on the world!".  Am I right, buddy? Heh. Uh.
Buddy?  Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why are you so darn opinionated, Norton? All you do with your searing and abnormal honesty is drive everyone away! When's Norton's time? When's Norton's time to shine?!
