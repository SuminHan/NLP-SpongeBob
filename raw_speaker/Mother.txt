What, what, what's all the yelling?
You just can't wait for me to die, can you?
Chocolate?
What, what are they selling?
What?
I can't hear you!
They're selling chocolate?
Chocolate. I remember when they first invented chocolate. Sweet, sweet chocolate.
I always hated it!
Live forever you say? I'll take one.
Come on, you lazy Mary!  Start rubbing me with that chocolate!
What? What did he say?
Well, no wonder. It's all old and dried out. Like that man right there.  Now put that thing where it belongs... in the garbage.
Will you sing the Krabby O' Mondays birthday song to my special little man?
It's okay, son. That's just SpongeBob ScaredyPants.
