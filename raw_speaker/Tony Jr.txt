Yeah, whatever.
Sure thing Teach!
Looks like it's my turn!  What goes around comes around!  Over and out!
So you just want me to ride around with this dude for awhile?
Whatever... Let's roll!
I said LET'S ROLL!
Just drive!
Relax man. You gotta relax.
No, I mean just relax man...
No, no, no. Not like that. You just gotta let go.
Be... cool...
Be... cool...
Not bad dude, not bad.
Ok Bro-Jangles! Catch you...  ...on the flipside!  What the!?
Yeah, what is it? Can't you see I'm walking here!?
Eager?
I can't teach you anything more at this square school, no offense SquarePants.
Well if you're really wanna learn more, you can come by my house laters!
Who is it?
Who?
Guy From School! Come on in!
Thanks! Lived here all my life! My mom and dad are out.
It means... you wanna see my dad's vintage speedboat collection?
And he took first place in this beauty surpassing speed records held by both Francis Baconskin Jr. and Smitty Tailpipe Rockama!
Pick your favorite!
Why sure you can! What the big-
Huh? The Batonia Classic! Excellent choice!  Want to take her for a spin?
You don't need a boating license for a raceboat SquarePants!
You're telling me!
I wouldn't if I were you! Remember it was you're nerves that made us almost crash before!
Just let go!  Phew...
Go faster SpongeBob!
Just let go! Of the brakes!
Now you're getting it!
AHHH!
Real cool SquarePants...
Yes!
SquarePants! I can't believe what I'm hearing here!
Ah... Look kid! Being cool includes accepting this challenge! Anything less would be an embarrassment!
What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you over that siren.
What's that? I couldn't hear you over that helicopter!
Sorry I couldn't hear you, my... my... MY DAD IS AFTER US!? What're we gonna do!?
Well just remember my advice, okay? All you got to do is let go... be cool... let go... be cool...
No, but I see where it's getting us next!
