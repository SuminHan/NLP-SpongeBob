You now stand in the most sacred place in all of Lameria.
I see you are an art lover, the sculpture of the Sphere Laser Dichotomy, it really holds the room together.
Not originally.  The Lamerians actually created us as a legion of janitor bots, and that's what we did until the great disaster.  But, when we realized that we were the only survivors, we took it upon ourselves to maintain the technology and customs of the once great civilization.  That's not to say it's been easy, it's been a couple of millennia.
You fools, what have you done? We told you, it  holds the room together.
Those two idiots.
Oh, what's the point. Our way of life has been destroyed, we no longer have a purpose.
Thank you, you have restored our dignity.
