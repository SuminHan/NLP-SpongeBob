Come along, sisters. Pay no mind to this crimson abomination!
Greetings. Although your establishment seems repugnant and foul in nature, it seems not to offend our sensitivities. It is for that reason, plus the fact that we have been stuck on a tour bus for several days, that my sisters and I would like to eat something here.
Well, Mister...um...
Mr. Krabs, you know the basic rules of behaving like a civilized bottom feeder. Perhaps your restaurant isn't quite the hive of degenerates it appears to be, and we had you figured all wrong.
Look at this wild hooligan. Running amok, singing, dancing. It's...  It's shamelessly disgusting. Avert your eyes. Young man, what has caused you to act like this? I must know!
Krabby Patty?
Well, anything this fun and delicious can be good. Why, what would this world be if everyone cavorted it in such a manner?
I am Ms. Gristlepuss. We are The United Organization Of Fish Against Things That Are Fun And Delicious. Or, TUOOFATAFAD. And we are going to ban these so called "Krabby Patties", and close your restaurant forever!
I would soon sprout legs and do the Watusi!
Thanks again, Al.
I just love that man.
