Oh, that's great. I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles.
Ooh, I've only got an hour for lunch.
Hey a wallet!  And there's 50 bucks in it. All right!
Gee, thanks, mister. Today must be my lucky day. I found a wallet with 50 bucks in it.
Ahh, too bad I forgot my umbrella.
Thanks for the roses, SpongeBob. Happy Valentine's Day.
Yes, I would like 2 Double Fried Kelp Fritters, 3 Krusty Krab Cream Filled Corals, and 4 Triple Fatty Krabby Patties. Is that too much?
Oh what?
An original Fiasco, you say?
No, but I do know how to open a cash register!
I don't know, but my money's on the one with the chrome back side.
Billions and billions?
Uh, ticket please.
What are you shrieking about?
"When I eat at the Krusty Krab, all I get is a dark, empty feeling inside!" P-Star7. Ouch!
I want one!
So...hungry...
No food... 3 days...
Yeah...
Oh. Krabby Patties, huh?
Yeah, yeah, sure. But where's the pizzazz?
Look at this place. I mean, what is the theme here? Underwater? It's boring!  Food! Water! Atmosphere!
