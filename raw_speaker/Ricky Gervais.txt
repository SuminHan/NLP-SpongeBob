Ten years ago, an unknown   pirate from Encino began a  decade long obsession  with TV's most beloved  an absorbent sponge. And today,  a mere ten years later, obviously,  ten years ago, I said that,  he has traveled all the way to a far off land known as, "Burbank."  To find Nicktoons Animation Studio  and meet his idol  face to face for the first time  in  ten years...it's ten years ago.  It's ten years ago.  Let's see what happens, yeah.
Wow, Patchy sure made a mess of things, didn't he? He's not much of a pirate either, really, come to think of it.  That's the problem.  Not like Blackbeard. Whoa, now there was a pirate.  Now Blackbeard  would have been able to get the real A-listers  on his TV special.  Yeah, your Bruce Willises and your Gwyneth Paltrows  and Ricky Gervaises.  Let's not forget him. Brilliant.  He wouldn't even have to shanghai them.  They would have  shown up on set out of respect.  and fear.  Back then, pirates were serious business.  Patchy's kinda  giving pirates a bad name, really,  if I'm being brutally honest.  Oh, well, thanks for watching, kiddies. We'll see you at the 20th anniversary.  That's 10 years from now. Starting now.
