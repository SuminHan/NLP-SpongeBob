HALT! Did someone say 'Mad Snail Disease'? Is that what all this is about?
Funny you should ask. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Doctor Gill Gilliam. S.D.E. and S.E.
Snail disease expert and snail expert. I'm sorry to break this to you all, but that 'mad snail disease' you're talking about doesn't exist.
That's right. No such thing. It's an old urban legend. A myth.
Of course not. No one is. It's just mass hysteria.
Those are only moderately untrimmed. All the supposed symptoms are just common ailments.
Hmmm... mm-hmm. Ahh! The problem's right here. He's got a little splinter in his foot.  I'm sure this was the cause of his distemper making for serious grouchy snailitis.
