Great! My wife's trying to grow a beard!
Naw, dang nematodes!
Why's he doing that?
Why's he doing that?
Ghosts!
Are my pants too tight, dear?
Yeah. But wasn't she wearing a hat?
My leg! My leg.
Talk about no talent.
Hey, guys, wait up. Huh? What's this?  That's kind of nice. Hey guys, come check this out.
Where is that awful song coming from?
To the radio station!
Who's responsible for that song on the radio?
Let's get 'em, boys!
You know, It's not that bad.
It's worth every penny.
Oh yeah, but the real genius is the composer!  Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!
Nice job!
Yeah, let's get out of here, as soon as I finish this delicious Krabby Patty!
Ah!
Sure son. Now you have a furry friend to give your pet without getting lonely.  And now Daddy can go on his business trips guilt-free.
I can't eat like this.
My leg!
So?
Cutsies? What's a cutsie?
Yeah, that's amazing.
My leg!
Huh, huh... Huh?
No... no!
Hey, who you calling slowpoke? You sidey!
A horn.
It's a jar of seeds.
Hmm. Three?
Say, "Fricassee."
I've had it and I'm not gonna take it anymore! ()
Rev up those fryers, cause I am sure hungry for one--   Help! Help!  My leg!
Hey everyone! The Drastic Radicals are tearing it up on Sand Mountain!
Hey, man, I'd like to hold onto my face, thank you!
We're eating here!
Hey, my Krabby Patty is just a bun! And the two buns... are also buns. Stale buns.
There he goes!
My leg!
Hey! Creepy squirrel! What's with all the eavesdropping?
"You will soon injure your legs?!"  My legs! I was looking for an excuse to get out of jury duty.  Thanks fortune cookie!
"A yellow sponge will serve you salmonella?!"
"You will live forever if you eat at the Chum Bucket?!"
He really knows how to complain.
Absolutely not, son. Your brain is your body's most important organ, not a toy.
Oh, Brainy, you're back!
Hey, watch it, lady!
How about a mint?
Hurry it up, will ya? Were hungry over here. Look at us. My kids haven't eaten in three days and I'm dying. That's not how you're supposed to flip it.
Food! Food! Ah.
I'll have two, please.
Oh, the creamy delicious horror.
Not at all, boy.
That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?
A ding-a-ling.
My eyes!
My eyes!
A Krabby Patty.
My leg!
Hey, Tom!
Nah, I'm going to the Shell Shack. They've got a talking dog!
Hey, everyone, listen! The talking dog at the Shell Shack is singing! Come on!
Hey! Where's Santa?
Thanks for the lies, Mr. Fairytale! Let's go waste our time somewhere else.
Hey, Santa, where's my present?
Oh, brother, this guy stinks!
Forks?! Come on!
I think she should buy both.
Hey, class is over.
Hey, buddy! What the heck is that?
No, not that!  That!
Could I try some?
Amazing! I've got to tell someone about this. Hey all you people! Hey all you people! Hey all you people, won't you listen to me? I just had a sandwich, no ordinary sandwich, a sandwich filled with jellyfish jelly! Hey, man, you've got to try this sandwich! It's no ordinary sandwich! It's the tastiest sandwich in the sea!  Yeah... Thank you!
Sir, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten! I'm going to come back here for lunch everyday for the rest of my life!  Hey, buddy, you alright?
He ate my wheelbarrow!
I'm so hungry!
My leg!
My leg!
Hey!
Sir? I'll give you one million dollars for that hat!
Yeah, you want that all at once?
Excuse me, sir, can I get a napkin?
To my tail fin. I'll get it myself.
