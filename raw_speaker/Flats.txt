Well, I like to kick people's butts.
Hi, SpongeBob. I'm going to kick your butt.
No. I mean it.
Hey, that story really speaks to me.
It says now, I'm gonna kick your butt twice as hard.
Dad, what're you doing?
What did I tell you about talking to strangers?
Yeah, except you forgot the part where I kick your butt!
What? Where am I?
Wow, I'm touched. I'll have to remember that when I'm kicking your butt.  Those flowers for me?
It's butt-kicking time!
Let's do it!
Are you ready?
