Eugene?
What are you doing with my bloomers?
Go to your room, mister. You're grounded for the rest of the night!
Eugene, lights out!
Hello, Eugene.
I just wanted to see my favorite son.
Well, I did see the prettiest hat in town today.
[stops screaming]Am I really that pretty?
Hello?  I'm hanging up.
Oh, you're that giant robot?
How did you know I wanted a hat? Have you been spying on me?
Well, how about the Krusty Krab? Tonight at 8:00?
Isn't it nice, Eugene? It's just the one I wanted.
Where did you get this old thing?
You can take this one back to the trash heap.
Thank ye for your concern for my finances, but me new boyfriend bought me this hat.
I don't know. I'm meeting him here, tonight.
Oh, my, you're a tiny thing, but awfully cute. Tell me about yourself.
Never heard of it.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Well...
Eugene!
Eugene, you put me boyfriend down, this instant!
Come, Plankton. I'm sorry me son had to spoil our romantic evening.
Eugene!
What did I tell ye about interfering in me life?
For your information, Eugene, he hasn't asked me once about the formula. I doubt that he even knows that I know it.
I forbid ye to interfere in me private business. Go to your office, now!
Oh, Sheldon.
I'm flattered by your offer, really I am, but I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment.
Now, now, Plankton, it's not what ye think.
The formula? Is that what this whole thing was about?
There you go, son. Your outfit's all finished. It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth.
I'm right here!
Boring!  I want to see some body parts!
Why, hello there!
Oh, dear! My poor old heart.
You should all be ashamed! And if you're gonna talk like sailors, then you're gonna work like sailors!
I guess you three scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade! Ah-ga-ga-ga-ga!  Yeeeoww! My  foot!
What? It's Old Man Jenkins and his jalopy.
