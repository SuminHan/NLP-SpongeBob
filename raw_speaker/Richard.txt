Hello, did somebody say "lawyer"?  Richard A. Bottomfeeder, Attorney at Law. I couldn't help but notice that despicable display.
Actually, I won't charge you a dime unless we win.
In fact, I think we should counter sue for everything Plankton owns.
Does that happen a lot?
Oh, this is going to be a slam-dunk...
Wracked...with pain...can't move.
Looks like you're going to have to handle this one, son.
Everything you need to win  is in this here case.
Uh huh. Everything but a suit.
