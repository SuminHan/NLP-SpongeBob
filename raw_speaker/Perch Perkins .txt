Hey, all you bottom-feeders. If you've already eaten, well, you might wanna make room for seconds, because we are tasting Bikini Bottom's sensational, new, upscale eatery, Le Chum Bucket. Look at all those classy diners! What's on the menu? It's called chum fricassee. Earlier, I spoke to head chef Squidward Tentacles. He shared with us why it's such a frica-success.
