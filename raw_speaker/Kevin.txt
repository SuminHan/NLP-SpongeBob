Bamboo? I only use composite materials in my net handle.
Next question.
Hi. What is your question?
Whatever. Next question, please.
Hello, loser. All right, you, way in the back.
Does anyone here have an actual...?
You're too kind.  Security!
Why don't you go jump off a building?
Punch yourself in the face.  Doesn't that hurt you?
That was the best!  This guy's great! We have got to bring this guy jellyfishing with us!
Look, I won't let the guy join the club. I just want to see how many times he can get stung before he goes running home like a baby.
Hey kid, how would you like to try out for the Jellyspotters?
Ah, nothing like driving through Jellyfish Fields with the top down, eh, Jellyspotters?
I hope you didn't forget our nets.
Hold it!  Before you become a Jellyspotter, you have to pass a rigorous test.
Quiet!, Shh!  Your first test: catch a jellyfish.
Uh, that doesn't count.  Ouch!
I meant two jellyfish!
That's not what I meant. I meant 20 jellyfish!
Ooh-ooh-ow! Ooh! Ow!
Jellyspotters allow jellyfish to eat jelly off their face.
How does it feel?
Not for long.
Will you cut that out?!
No! I have many more tests for you to take!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No!
Okay, SquarePants, it is your turn to get zapped! I mean... are you ready for your final test?
You'd better be, because we're going to capture a queen jellyfish.
Oh, don't worry. We can't do it without you!
Well, then you've probably never used a queen jellyfish call. Why don't you try it out?
I'll bet you have.
Oh, don't worry, we'll be right behind this bush.  Who's got my sting ointment?
That's right! You should have seen the look on your face when we zapped you!
Did you think we'd  let you into the Jellyspotters?
So were they.
You looked so dumb with your dorky jellyfish call!  Loser, loser, loser loser loser!
Loooooser!  Ah-ha-ha-ha!  Cnidaria rex!
Kissyface!
I think he's gone. One of you go out and check.
Don't look at me! I was just in this for the fashion!  It's hopeless! We're trapped! We're trapped!  Help me, mommy! Help me! I want my blankie! I want my blankie!
I can't believe it! How did you know?
Well, SquarePants, that was impressive, but you're still not in the club because you didn't catch a queen jellyfish.  Wait, what are you doing?  Aaah!
It wasn't...
