Okay, SpongeBob, my treedome is a highly technical facility and there are many facets to its operation. SpongeBob, are you getting all this?
Here's a comprehensive list of "do"s and "don't"s to follow.
That's to save paper. You'll need this special reading scope.
Now pay attention as I clue you in on some of your more elaborate responsibilities. This majestic structure is my kelp greenhouse. Its functions are complete automated, so all you have to do...
...is check this thermometer right here and make sure the temperature is normal.
And this is the robot warehouse. It's where I keep all my robots.
This part's easy. All's you gotta do is come in here and count every single one of these robots and make sure none of them's gone missing. You seem to be doing a good job paying attention, SpongeBob.
Oh! Why, thank you, SpongeBob!
This here is my worm incubator. They're not set to hatch for weeks, but I just thought I'd show it to you anyway. And last but not least is my collection of rare and fragile artifacts that has to be cleaned twice daily. Now are you sure you can handle all that, SpongeBob?
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
Okay.
