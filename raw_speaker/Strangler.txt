Heh, what're you gonna do, call the police?
Bodyguard, huh? I might be able to help you out.
Heh heh, he doesn't look so tough.
Huh? Uh-oh. Uhh, there's too many witnesses around here.  Listen, kid. I could be your bodyguard. Here's my card.
Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man.  Or that baby.
Huh? Uhh, that's mine.
Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley...
Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected.  Perfect.
Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick.
Whatever gets us to your house quicker.
Can we just go to your house?!
All right, enough of the sappy talk! Open the door so I can strangle you... I mean, uhh, choke you... I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe... gah, I mean...
Thanks.
