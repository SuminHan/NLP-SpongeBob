That was Kelpy G. Taking you on a trip that is out of this ocean. Hope you fellow Kelpheads got your tickets early 'cause his concert tonight at High Tide Stadium is, sorry, sold out.
This goes out to all those sad sacks without a ticket to tonights concert. We're giving away the last two tickets to one lucky caller.
Hey, you are lucky loser number one. Please, try again. Hey, you are lucky loser number five. Please, try again. Hey, you are lucky loser number nine. Please, try again. Twenty-two. Try again. Twenty-seven. Sixty-five.
Hello! You're winning caller number 102.
Not only have you won two front row seats, but you and a friend will go backstage to meet Kelpy G himself.
