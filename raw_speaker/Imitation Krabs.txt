Mr. Squidward...
That's right, I am Krabs.
Ha, ha, ha.
Hey, why don't you take the rest of the day off?
That's just my metal suit. I made it to protect the formula.
Look, a jellyfish.
Never mind that. I need to talk to you.
Never mind. I need you to tell me...
Yoinks!
Nothing stands between me and that secret formula now.  Ouch!
Hello SpongeBob, it is me, Mr. Krabs.  In the flesh.  Standing right in front of you.  With no one else around.
I thought we might discuss the Krabby Patty secret formula.
What? Why, yes it is.  I must get this shirt cleaned. Alright, now tell me the secret formula.
Oh yes. Here, let's shake.
Uh, right, why don't you start?
Formula time?
Yum yum, this spaghetti sure is good. Belch!
Okay, now let's hear that formula.
Now why can't you tell me the formula?!
Gasp!
Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. Remember: Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formuoli.
Don't listen to him. He's obviously a robot.
Who are you calling steam-driven...?
9:30 A.M.
99!
Thank you, SpongeDupe.
Yoinks.
