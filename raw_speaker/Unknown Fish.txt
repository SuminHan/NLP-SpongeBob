The commotion, my dear Krabs, is regarding the hygiene standards of your eating establishment, which would appear to be inadequate.
Is that what you consider clean and disease-free, Krabby? I say we ramshack this greasy disease shack! Who's with me?
Let us apprehend that careless contaminator!!!
I supersede all of you! For I have an exotic accent.
In the light of today's events, that notion is crass and offensive.  I'll take two, please.
