SpongeBob?
Well, if you mean from beyond the kitchen table, yes. You're just in time. I've baked a fresh batch of gingerbread men.
Oh, Blackjack just called and left a message for you. He couldn't make it because he's got some loose ends to tie up.
And if you don't hurry, you'll miss out on all the fun.  And when it's all done, he'll need help cleaning up the mess.
Hooligans!
This is disgusting!
SpongeBob!
Come in and sit for a while.  Have a cookie, SpongeBob!
Now, who wants to lick the spoon?
...and then we drove all the way home with all the windows down in the freezing cold.
Hop in my car, I'll drop you off.
SpongeBob, you forgot your kissy-kissy!
Oh, hello, SpongeBob. What a nice surprise. Come here and give your Granny her kissy-kissy.
Oh, you are absolutely right.
You will definitely not be treated like a baby around here anymore ever again.
Well, I'm glad that's settled.  But what am I going to do with all these fresh baked cookies?
And don't forget the cookie-eating hat!
Well, look who's here. It's my big old adult grandson.
Oh, oh, no roughhousing with a full tummy.  Who's the baby?
Here's a fresh batch of cookies.
More cookies!
Oh, you don't want this baby food. How about a big piece of steamed coral?
Storytime!
You'll enjoy this, Patrick. It's a wonderful story about a magical sea leprechaun.  Oh, SpongeBob, you wouldn't be interested in this baby book.  Here's the technical manual on routine active maintenance.
Hold still, hold still.  All better?
How about I give you a present?
No, Patrick, it's a sweater?
With love in every stitch.
Oh, I almost forgot.  Here's some office supplies. I didn't wrap them. I knew you wouldn't mind.  Uh-oh, three o'clock, time for adults to go to work. Bye-bye, SpongeBob.
No, no, no, that wouldn't be the adult thing to do.
Okay, thanks for stopping by, SpongeBob.
Come again if you get the chance.
Toodleloo.
I know how busy you are.
Shh, he's asleep.
Take it easy, SpongeBob.  SpongeBob. SpongeBob!  You don't have to be a baby to get ol' Grandma's love.
Of course not.  No matter how grown-up you get, you'll always be my little baby boo.  And remember, you can kiss your grandma and still be an adult.  Here you go.
No problem.
