It  him!
Aren't you the esteemed Squilliam Fancyson the Third, who we all came here to see perform tonight?
Oh, dear. Well, that's too bad.
Because I'm head matron at an esteemed musical college in town and thought if you  Squilliam Fancyson, I would offer you the high-paying and prestigious opportunity to come there and teach your very own music class.
Yes.
But didn't you just say a minute ago that your name was Squidward Q. Tentacles?
Well, that's a relief. I mean, what kind of a moron would go to their worst enemy's music recital?
Well, good evening, Professor Squilliam.
Ooh, they're so strange.
It's true, we're onto your little ruse!
The  Squilliam, as we all know, has a large, bushy unibrow just at the base of his forehead.
