Hello!
Stand at attention, Mr. Krabs!  I want you to tell me the meaning of this!
This is the navy, son! We don't cut the crusts off! We eat the crusts and throw the rest away!
I'm telling you for the last time! You're gonna have to stop making your food so delicious!
Well, you better figure it out! I need my men  wide-eyed and hungry, Krabs! We've got a cargo-hold full of suntan lotion! And...
Chafed!
So, tonight's meal is gonna be terrible! You understand, me?!
The worst you've ever made!
The kind of slop that will put some steel in their spines!
Either that or I'll throw you in the brig!
What's all this "huzzahing" about?!
Attention!  Looks like slop alright. But what's this?
Cherries jubilee?!
Flaming?! What are you trying to pull, you lubber? This looks like regular cherries jubilee!
Stand down, Krabs! I'll have you on irons!
We're not outfitted for battle, Krabs! There's no ammunition! The cannons are ornamental at best!  Ornamental at best!
What you're suggesting is mutiny!
I can't do it. I'm weak.
My personality!
