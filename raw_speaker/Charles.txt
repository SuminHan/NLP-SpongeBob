That's a good boy, Foofie. Look at your luxurious mane. Every self-respecting snail has one.
Oh, yes. How could I forget? Accessories! Your diamond-studded leash?
Of course, there's the cherry on the beauty cake: the glossy painted shell! And last but, not least, well maintained oral hygiene. Just look at your pearly whites!
Anyway, we best run along, Foofs. Your pedicure is in half an hour.
Come, now, Foof. Put your tail up, up, up.
My boy, don't seem to get it do you? There's only one way to prove your pet's beauty. By winning the pet contest. But I wouldn't bother, seeing as how Foofie and I have won in the past five years!  Oh, well, enough mingling with the common folk. Let's go win our medal, Foof.
Oh, why, thank you, sir.
What a hideous display. At least I know you would never behave like all these heathens, right, Foofie?
Foofie?
Foofie!
Foofie, what have you done?
What's this about? Does anyone speak snail?
