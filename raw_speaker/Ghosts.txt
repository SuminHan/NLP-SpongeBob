Yo-ho-ho, yo-hoooooooooooo!
Oh, we're the ghouls of the briny deep! Under the waves we like to creep. Creeping in coffins and spider webs as ghostly pillows beneath our heads. Oh, we're the ghouls of the briny deep. Under the waves we like to creep. We have black shrouds that look quite neat, but we don't own shoes, cause we have no feet. Ha-ha-ha!  We like to haunt and frighten and scare till you jump right out of your underwear. We like to eat eyes and brains and drink our grog from rusty drains. We don't keep animals like cutesy snails!
Our favorite pet's, the cat-o-nine-tails!
