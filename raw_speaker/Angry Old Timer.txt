Play your toys into my yard, will ya? Well, they're mine now!
Hey!
What are you sneak thieves doing into my house? Them brains violated my air space and I'm keepin' them! I'm callin' the cops!
Bring it on, Slimmy Whiskers! All twenty-threes can do your bees knees with one nickel, sister!
I'm sorry, Squirrel Lady! I just couldn't take watching all the kids have fun in the air while I'm stuck here with this crotchety cane on the ground!
Look out my dears below! Take a ride on the love copter!
