That's me! Dead Eye Plankton!
Well, what are you looking at?!
Get up you two! I'm here for my... money, Krabs  .
That's the idea!  I thought we were all clear on that.
I'll be back at high noon tomorrow for the deed!
WHO SAID THAT?!  Well, last time I checked, this town was Dead Eye Gulch! Not Yokelburg!  Yokelburg...  Who are you anyway?
Sheriff!  'Round these parts we call them coffin jockeys!
That must be a new record for running off a sheriff.
Where do you get these guys?  All right, kid. I'm going to make it simple for you. I'm a villain, got it?
And this town ain't big enough for the both of us! Understand?
So, vamoose! Or we're going to have to settle this western-style at high noon, savvy?
You have no idea what I'm talking about?
(sighs)  And stay out! Hey, only three seconds off my record!  What are you hayseeds looking at?  Get out of here!
I love this town!
Great idea!  Okay, let's see,  personal possessions, clothes off your backs, that should about do it! Look, I'm just going to drop off all my new stuff at the bank. I'll be back at high noon to rub my victory in your face with a little dance. Uh huh, waa-waa! Uh huh, waa-waa!
That's right! And when I take the deed to your saloon Krabs, I'll own every building in town! And you'll all have to work for me the rest of your miserable lives!  Swallowed a bug! I hate that. It totally ruins an evil laugh. Yee-how!
Oh, I am terrified.
So, fry cook, you're back! And all alone.
So, it's come to this. Mano y mano.
Well, well, well, look at the time! High noon!  Ow!  I hate all of you!
You can't do this!
Ah! Ouch! Ooh!
I have a lot of money!
History will vindicate me!
Curses!
Help me!
That's me, Dead Eye Plankton.
