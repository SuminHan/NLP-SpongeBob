Yeah, who's calling me?
Oh, really? Well, I'm president of the SpongeBob Fan Club, Tarzana chapter, and I'm throwing a TV show, too,  so get in line.
Can't I? Well, guess what. I'm doing it. You'd better wrap your mind around it because guess what.  My show's also gonna be a lot better.
You name it, we've go it: Hollywood stars, musical people, singers, jugglers, a guy who does things with knifes.  Do you have that,  huh? Who do you have?
What?! The world's fifth best ventriloquist and his wooden sidekick?
No way!  No!  Okay, you win this time, but just you wait for the 20th. 'Cause I will come at you harder and faster.
