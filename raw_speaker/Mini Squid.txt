Hello, Squidward.  Squidward! It's me, Mini Squid!
Hello, Squidward.
Wondrous weather we're having, eh, Squidward, old pal?
SpongeBob made a replacement you: me. So when you you don't want to play, SpongeBob will play with me-you.
Yeah.
Three words. Movie title.  "12 Angry Jellyfish".
Of course, I am. I love to work!
Sorry, sir. Can I take your order?
Well, thank you very much.
Okay, SpongeBob. Always happy to help.
Okay, who ordered the Krabby Patty, and who ordered the Krabby Patty?
Hey, everybody! I'm Squidward and I love to dance.
Well, gosh, okay.
Everybody dance!
Yep, those were the days.
