No problem! As long as it's not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that.
Of course! I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors.
Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow to check out the house. See you then!
Oh my! The house is even more beautiful in person!  Hello Mr...  Uh... Mr. Tentacles?
It's funny, I pictured you being much taller.
Now if you want the sale to go through, you've got to tell me all the positive things about your house.
Uhh... well, you didn't mention that on the phone.
Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested...
Oh my, this painting is very nice.
Who's that?!
You're both Squidward?
Okay, I really don't want to hear another one.
I really don't want to hear more, thank you.
Who are you?
What kind of fool do you take me for?! He's Squidward, he's Squidward, you're Squidward?! I'm Squidward! Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?
I'm outta here.
I wouldn't sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on earth!
Stop! Stop!
Never!
