Thank you, Prof. Lonnie, here's a flash: I can read!
Look at that kid go!
Clam it Donnie, this kid is bad to the bone, we gotta get him to join our crew.
Hey there, killer! My name is Sharkface, don't let the teeth intimidate ya.
Well, hey there, SpongePants. You ain't a square as you look  You are one poppin' peripheral!
Oh let me introduce you to my fellas here.  Here's my main man, Lonnie!
Keepin' it cooler than a sea cucumber is Ronnie.
And that decked out righteous brother, is the one, the only, Donnie!
And we are...
Well, we've seen you doing your stuff inside there, and I have to say, you got skills Sponge-o.
We could use a fella like you in our crew, ever since we lost, Jonnie!
Shut it.
Hey look, we got a hole in our crew and we need somebody to fill it, how would you like to join the Sharks?
Of course you do.
Alright let's bail on this joint, cruise the neighborhood.
Aw, don't worry about them Bettys, it's a waste of time.
I told you not to worry, but you keep on worrying.
That guy's looney.
We practically own the place!
Slow down, this is our spot. Sponge. Huh?  The Pods.
We're gonna be there! And we're no jellies!
Your right Sponge, we got a showdown to get ready for.
Forget the cops, it's the Pods we need to take down, and we can do that because we got you on our side.
Do not shrimp out on us Sponge-o. The showdown is at the playground, tonight! so were gonna see you there, right?
Don't disappoint us Sponge.
That was a total accident, that's how we lost, Jonnie.  Jonnie thought he could do a quadruple pirouette, he lost control he fell down,  he scratched up the floor pretty bad, he won't be able to dance in days, maybe even a week!
We would never do such a thing!
It's all over, nobody can defeat, Internal Affairs.
