Thank you, Bob. This week, I visited
This week, I reviewed The Krusty Krab restaurant, a local burger joint that's second to none; or should I say second to "run," since this critic wanted to make like a banana and peel out the minute he saw how drab this Krab really was.
Barbara, once I stuck my beak through that door, my appetite flew South for the winter. I mean, I'm not "kidding" when I saw this restaurant smells like the rear-end of a goat.
You could find livelier help in a graveyard and I'm not just "coffin."  The management stunk so bad, I had to get my sweater dry cleaned on the way home... with me  it.
However, at the end of my visit, I chowed down on a meal that titillated my taste buds and gratified my gullet. That Sponge behind the grill is no square when it comes to cooking.  If Krabs really wanted to soak up the dough, he'd sponge it up, he'd sponge it out, he'd oversponge it. You can never have too much Sponge.
We have, your honor. We the jury find the defendant, Eugene A. Krabs, guilty of all charges.
