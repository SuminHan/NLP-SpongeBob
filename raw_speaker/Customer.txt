I'll take 20!
What can I do for you boys?
Really?
Small world. What's the matter with you guys?
Well, some guys have all the luck.
I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning, I break my legs, and every afternoon, I break my arms.
At night,  I lay awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.
Oh, no...
Ow...
Ow...!
Well, there is one thing... as you can imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars.
Such nice boys,  it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! HA HA HA!
Thanks, uh...  Oh.
Well, you really should be wearing a name tag so I can thank you properly.
No.
Boo! You stink!
One Monster Krabby Patty, please.
One krabby patty, please.
I'll have one KelpShake, please.
I'd like that table over by the window.
Perhaps this will speed up the process.
Five bucks if I get the table now.
Wait, just one more?
Of course!
I want one Krabby Patty.
Can I get a Krabby Patty Combo?
How about a Double Krabby?
Can I get a Triple Patty with soda?
Yeah! Amazing isn't it?
He's got a point. Let's get out of here.
Excuse me, can I have a refill on my soda?
Oww! Oh, my foot! Oh, my foot!  Oww! My back!  My face!
Oh, I could never do that. He gets far too lonely and upset when he's left alone.  Sorry, buddy, I guess I can't buy you that Krabby Patty you wanted. Let's just go home.
Uh, you charged me three times.
Loose change!
1 Krabby Patty please?
Yeah, I like to order...
Uh, so I like to order...
I would like a Krabby Patty.!
Why don't you want a Krabby Patty?
Just give me a patty, man.
We want our patties, man.
Krabby Patties again? Sigh if only there were something else... Hey, whatcha got there Frank?
Hey! I'd like to request a wiener!
Thanks! 12 inches of deliciousness!
No, what?
Thanks!
With extra cheese. To go!
Money! Yay!
I'll have 2 Krabby Patties.
Do you...need a break or something?
Of course I have! That's where I'm going. If you'll get out of my way.
But I'm hungry now!  Ha-ha!  Okay, already!
Weirdos.  What the?  Eat at the Krusty Krab? I'm disgusted! Yet, strangely..hungry.
Boy! I can't wait to have one of your renowned shakes Sir Frostymug!
Hey, I'm trying to walk here!
Boy, these Krabby Patties are delicious.
That thumbs-up really touched my heart.
Poor kid.
I'd like to place an order for two.
That's me: The man of your dreams. []
Huh?
This is the worst service we've ever had! We're going to the Chum Bucket!
Thanks.
Hey, they're getting away!
Please tell me there's something soft below me.
Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing garbage and recycling!
All right. All secondary characters, come with me.
Ugh... what is in these things?
