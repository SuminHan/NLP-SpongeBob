Sanitation police! This is a raid. Step away from the refuse.
Thanks for the information, citizen.
Do your duty, Sergeant.
This residence is now comdemned.
Condemned means this house is unfit to live in. You'll have to vacate the home immediately.
Anything that is a threat to public health must be condemned. Sargeant.
I'll request a commendation for you.
Right after we condemn your house!
Yes! It's as filthy as your neighbor's.
You can evacuate the premises or throw away your junk.
Thank you for the attempt, ma'am.
Which way did he go?
Hey, look.
