Hellooo!
The same. You wouldn't happen to be watching House Fancy, would you?
Well Squiddy, I enjoy our chat, but my catered lunch awaits. And you know how hard being fabulous is on an empty stomach!
Oh I'm dreadfully sorry, Nicky dear. Well, toodle loo Squidward.  Enjoy the program.
Hello, peasants.
Why thank you, Nick.
Oh, Nicky.
I bid you welcome, to my foyer.
It certainly is, Nicky.
It sure is! It's a gilded door knob.
Absolutely imported.
Of course.
Isn't it?
Well, of all this gushing perfectly deserved.  And now, I'd like to present to you my most favorite room, in the house  It's all custom. Ah, look at this, it's my jewel-encrusted toilet paper holder.
Come, let me show you the roof!
Watch your step.  This may take a while. Just sit back and relax.
I brought some soap.  All ashore. Welcome, to my roof top garden! Romantic grotto, sparkling berry mineral soda waterfall, and my personal favorite, a 134-foot-long sculpture of my unibrow!
If you look closely, you'll notice that it's made entirely out of gilded door knobs.
What?
I have the fanciest ring?
Oh.  Hello? Oh yeah, hang on.  It's for you.
Go ahead, say it.
Huh?
Thank you.  Thank you.  Ah.
Well, don't just stand there! Get the sand out of your leotard and dance for me, nitwit.  Dance!  Not like that, kelp for brains! You call that dancing? Do it like this!  Here I go!  Who put you on the planet? Ugh!! Now, do it exactly as I did, and don't stop till you get it right!  And I don't care how long it takes!
Of course they can!
Stuck doing community service eh? Court ordered?
Oooh! Maybe if you clean up Bikini Bottom they'll build a statue of you! Oh wait! They've already built one... of me!  I cleaned up all of Bikini Bottom in one week.
Ooh! Let me help you out  There! That should get you started. Tah-tah!
Great job SpongeBob, you even captured his smell. The scent of failure.  My glorious statue!
It was.
Man Ray is great.
Sounds like you've got a dying animal to attend to, eh ol' chum?
I hear you're playing the cash register now.
It's big and valuable. I'm the leader of a big fancy band now, and we're supposed to play the Bubble Bowl next week.
That's right. I'm living your dreams Squidward. The problem is, I'm busy next week and can't make it. So, I was hoping you and your band could cover for us.
I knew it! You don't even have a band! Well, I'll just let you get back to the service industry now.
Good luck next Tuesday. I hope the audience brings lots of... ibuprofen!
Oh I just came to watch you blow it. So, where's your band?
Then who's that?
Well, Squiddy, this is exactly how I pictured your band would look.
So, I just took my private yacht across my private lake to my private heliport. It's the only way off my private island.
On your lunch break, eh, Squiddy?
Oh, just succeeding in everything you've failed in.
Oh, is that so? Let's hear what you've accomplished since high school, Squiddy.
Hold it, don't tell me. You're a cashier!
Squidward, I had no idea you were such a success.
And I would be honored if you would allow me to come to your restaurant tonight.
In fact, we'll all come. My treat!
Hello, Squiddy!  We're all ready to be dazzled by your five-star restaurant.
Explain what? That you, Squidward Tentacles, voted most likely to suck eggs in high school,  or tried to pass off a lousy burger stand at the five-star...  ...restaurant!?  Hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina...
Mmm... this is fantastic!
Alright, I admit it. Everything is fabulous. The food, the atmosphere! Everything's flawless!
Uhh, "Squidward Tentacles..."
Oh, eh, "Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest..."
"Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest restaurant in Bikini Bottom... and he does not suck eggs."  Squidward, I must tell you...  Thank you. What really won me over was your brilliant waiter. It's as if all he knows is fine dining... and breathing. I must know your name.
Yes, your name, son.
No, your name.
Well, Squiddy, I'm waiting.
Squidward, I understand. I have a confession to make myself. I made everything up about my life. I have no yachts, jets, or anything. I was only trying to impress you. The horrible, sad truth is, I'm a cashier too!
Of course not! I'm filthy stinking rich! Come on, everyone. Let's all take a ride in my balloon/casino!
