90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.
Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days!
Next.
You're done. You know, next contestant. You didn't make the cut, sorry, Mac.
Hey!
Uh, what about number 52 over there?
Well, let me see.  Why, yes, he is a single dancer.
All rise. Eugene Krabs.
As punishment for committing the crime of grand theft, I sentence you to give away Krabby Patties for free, all day tomorrow.
All right, let's see. Uh-huh. Decent Stalk Length. Oh, good hinge action. Ah, Foofie. Excellent bow stretch. Well-defined eyelid capillaries. Foofie is looking as good as ever, Charles.
Okay, let's have a look-see, shall we? Ah, yes, good spacing on the larynx. Nice gastric chamber. All within breed description.
Now, if we can just check the undercarriage.
Well, I think we can all agree that this years groomers cup goes to... SpongeBob and his wonderful pet!
What are you talking about? The snail didn't win, I was referring to your other pet. He's so adorable.
Attention penny pinchers!
It's time to award the trophy  for this year's Cheapest Crab!
And the nominees are: Eugene Krabs! In: "Sign of the Times!"
Next up is Buford Bargain Bottom in: "Convenience Store Caper!"
And Dwight T. Wad in: "Tying Up Loose Ends!"
Well, that's highly unconventional, but okay. We will now hear a testimony from a Krusty Krab employee!
We've heard enough.  Disqualified!
Preposterous! This is all mine!
You took the entire hotel room?
That is the stingiest display I've ever seen. I declare you the new winner!  See ye next year!
Are you ready, Mr. Squidward?
