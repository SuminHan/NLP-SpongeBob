Sour Note?
Mr. Superawesomeness, take him down.
Uhh, Maybe we should have picked a better superpower for you, Patrick.
All right, team. Time for hands in the middle!
Great job, guys, we did it!
Sandy? Is that you?
Hmm. It looks like Burger Beard forgot the first rule of mobile fry-cooking: Always batten down your grease traps.
Whoa!  HE'S AFTER THE BOOK! Sandy, use your squirrel powers!
Oh, she's never gonna make it!  Huh? Everyone lean!
The book! Sour Note!
All right, Burger Beard, prepare to be teamworked!
Uh, I don't get it.
Oh. Get him, The Rodent!
Patrick, I should have never doubted your powers!
Mr. Krabs!
Uh-oh.  Huh?
Patrick!
Patrick?
I'm... I'm seeing a bright light.
Much. Thank you. But the discomfort I feel in my eyes is nothing compared to the shame I feel for letting down the Patty. For letting down Bikini Bottom.
No, Patrick,  blew it, as a team.
Plankton?
He's getting away!
Yes, we can, Patrick. But this time there's one more hand to go in the middle.  Plankton?
Especially when that something is the Krabby Patty. Okay, everybody, let's get back to Bikini Bottom and...  Oh, no! I don't have the page!
It must be back on Pelican Island!
Thanks. Squidward!
Come on, it's time to go back and open up The Krusty Krab!
