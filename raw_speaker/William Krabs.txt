Business is good today!
Charge him double for his drinks.
What brings you to Dead Eye Gulch, stranger?
Wonderful! You're hired.  Hey everybody! Meet our new sheriff!
No offense, kid. But your chili tastes terrible.
No, in a terrible way. Look, we already gave you the badge. And the law of the west says: no take backs!
Shshshshshsh! So that means, you're the new sheriff!
Uh, he's at Boot Hill.
Because Old Dead Tree Hill was totally full.
That no-good goon wants my saloon! And me I.O.U's due tomorrow noon! If we don't get some help here real soon...
What? How am I supposed to keep the deed to me saloon if you keep taking all me mortgage payments? I'm going broke, here!
Oh, yeah.
'Cause without a sheriff, Dead Eye won't stop until he has the clothes off our backs!
So, that's it.
And me money! Me beautiful, beautiful money!
Could you get to the point? We're freezing!
Well, I think we all know the answer.
No offense, kid. But your advice is as terrible as your chili.
We're right behind you boy! WAY WAY behind you!
Can I try?
Thank you sheriff SpongeBuck for saving our town. And for stepping on that little varmint.
We melted down Plankton's gold and made a statue in your honor.
Sorry about the whole tricking you into being sheriff thing. And to make it up to you, I've got a new badge for you. If you'll take it.
