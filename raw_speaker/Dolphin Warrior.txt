You fools!
I am an ancient warrior from long ago. The last of my kind who ruled over the ocean from before the dawn of time. But, alas, my people were wiped out by the same volcano that plagues you now.
I survived, because I was the only one who knew how to stop it!
You must make... A SACRIFICE!
A sacrifice must be made of the most miserable person.
