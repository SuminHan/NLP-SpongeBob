I'm Busy. Hurry up.
Oh. Don't give me that Patchy stuff. Come on, Depp, I know it's you. Drop the pirate thing.
Come on. Who is this? The pirate from the cereal box or the litter box.
Oh, the president. Well, your mother must be so proud.
Listen, Scratchy.
You know, Catchy, maybe you should consider wearing two eye patches. That way, you won't be able to see what's become of your life.
So, what are you tell me, what are you selling, besides your dignity and self-respect?
Sorry, Poop-Leg Pete. I'm a big star. I don't do basic cable. I'm on a major network. Kind of.
Oh, it would mean a lot. Well, why didn't you say so? That changes everything.
You know, I'd love to be on your show. I'd love it as much as I love pulling ticks off my butt.
Okay, Captain Loser. Send me a script.
Sure, of course. I'm sure that it's a great script. Three, two, one. For me to poop on!
