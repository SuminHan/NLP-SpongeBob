Hey! Hey! Heeeeeeeyyyyy! I'm yelling over here!
Well, I'd like to take you up on your offer to make the Chum Bucket a success!
But, but that's my chum-fueled antennae massager!
Anyone can come in and redecorate, pal, but you still haven't proven how you're gonna make chum edible!
You're making chum pudding?
Secret recipe, you say, huh?  What's in it?
Who took my blue blanky? Huh? This is the secret stuff? Doesn't look very promising.
A star.
Ha-ha-ha! That's right, Krabs! Now, we have a secret formula, and it's in a bottle, and you can't have it! Ha-ha!
Secret!!!!
Isn't it obvious?
That's right, Plankton! My robotic Patrick has lured you and that delicious patty into my fiendish hands! Now hand it over!
Maybe I can't, but the Pat-Bot 3000 can. Behold! A hydraulic metal claw to crush your bones! A titanium tipped ripping saw to cut your flesh! And a paddle ball! Made from rubber and wood! And a staple. Anyways, get him!
Yes! You can run but,you can't hide SquarePants! How do you like that huh? Take that!
Here comes the paddle ball! I've got you right where I want you!
Now give me the patty! Huh?
Well, at least I still have the pickle. Well, this stinks.
