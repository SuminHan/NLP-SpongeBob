Hold it! No one beyond this point!
No can do big guy! Too dangerous!
Thank you little boy!
Mr. Eugene Krabs?
A ticket?  Now why would I write you a ticket? Huh? Oh, I know! How about for turning the whole town into a parking lot!
Relax man, that's just my order. I want two Krabby Patties and Kelp Fries to go! I don't wait in lines!
You're welcome. Just hope the Mayor doesn't find out about this mess. He's the one you need to worry about!  Mayor.
That was easy...
Except the law!
Come along, Plankton. It's back to jail for you!
Just move along.
Well, gentlemen, I believe our porter is really none other than international fugitive Orin J. Ruffy.  You're not.
International fugitive Orin J. Ruffy.
Fugitive Orin J. Ruffy.
Orin J. Ruffy.
Hold it right there, Mr. Tentacles!
Here! Just read this!
A well thought out and organized list of complaints!
FYI, you don't have to live here, you know!
Eighty-six those patties, Krabs. We just got a call about two ghouls burying a stiff over by Shallow Grave Road.
