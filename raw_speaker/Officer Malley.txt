You're gonna do time, Strangler. Hard time.
Yeah. We got him chained up real good. He'll never get away.
Yep, he got away.
Yeah, give us a call if you see him again... tattletale.
Stop right where you are! I'm afraid we're going to have to arrest the two of you!
For not being at the Krusty Krab to whip us up a couple of dee-licious Krabby Patties!
What's the holdup back there?
Well buckle up and we'll drive real smooth-like.
Is that boy ok?
Take that, you zombie!
Good police work, officer Nancy. Hey, this guy's not a zombie. He's just an ordinary health inspector.
This'll fix ya!  Now let's get that one.
Yeah! That guy had no front license plate! Let's get him!
Freeze! Your joyride's over, punk.
Why would you go to jail? You already did your time.
