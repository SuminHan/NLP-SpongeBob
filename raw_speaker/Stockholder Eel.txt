: Gentlemen, please.
: Exactly. I like you, young man. Everybody scoot down and so he can sit next to me. And I wont intimidate him at all by my terrifyingly long soap opera activity. As this junior executive so eloquently put it, Where exactly are we?
: I need a straight answer, not a bunch of meaningless charts! What do you give a disappointed stockholder to make him feel better?
: Alright, hold it! Now all of you just hold it right there! Its easy to laugh and judge. Keep a man with scholar when you hear an idea that stands out because its so unusual.  So, everybody, just stop and think for a minute about what your colleague is really trying to say because I want to be the one to tell him. Thats the silliest thing Ive ever heard.
: Yes, maybe I was too hasty about that.  Well, you're definitely giving a new meaning to the word meaningless.
:  Yes.
: I dont know who you are, but you better not be an impostor. Do you know what happens to impostors in conference room 4-B?
:  Mister, this is the last straw!  Now, Im just going to give you just 18 more chances to prove yourself.
: Jenkins!
: Mustache.
: You know, kid. We need somebody like you around here.
: For me to fire!
