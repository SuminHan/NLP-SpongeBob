Excuse me. Are we in any kind of peril?
Three cheers for Squidward!
Hip, hip...
What should we do with this tyrant, Captain Squidward?
Well, I guess any man who invented the Hatty Patty can't be all bad. Okay, let's get him out.
Hey, it's Captain Squidward's fault that we lost the man who invented the Hatty Patty!
But we're still stuck in this rip current!
We're alive! Captain Squidward steered us out of the rip current!
This neighborhood's crazy! I wonder if there are any good places to eat.
Captain!
Well, that was anti-climatic.
A tuba?
Well, that was anti-climatic.
Squidward Tentacles. Apparently he's a clarinet player.
