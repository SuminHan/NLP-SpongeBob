Go ahead.  Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Yeah, so?
Uhh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting.  Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?
Uhh, that won't be necessary. Go ahead.
How tough are ya?
Sure.
Get outta here. This place is too tough for you, little man.
Listen, kid. I think you'd be more comfortable over at that place.
Oh, no, sorry, I was actually pointing at the place next to it.
Yeah. Unless you think you're tough enough to fight me.
You were sayin'?  Go ahead, buddy.
Would you get outta here?
Not much. Say, haven't I seen you before?
Nice try, kid. I know it's you.
Aha!
Ah, you can go in. Sorry about that!  What do you want?
Alright, now it's a party! Oh, yeah, check out the new ink.
Yeah. Hey, what about that one?
Can you make it dance?
Hmmm, wait a minute.  Go ahead in.
Nice try, little man.
Hold it, you two  that's enough, you're both plenty tough, go ahead in.
I saw you runnin'. When you get in a real fight, then we'll talk.
Whoa, whoa, little man. You still can't go in.
Oh yeah?
Wow.
Hmmm... what about that guy?
Wow! You destroyed that guy without even touchin' him.
I never thought I'd say this, but go ahead in.
