One Krabby Patty please.
Ohh, but I-
I-
I-
Please I-
I brought exact change...
Oh dear. Seems I'm just one short.
Oh, But it's all I have. Please...
Ohhh pleasssseeee.
Pleasse, Oh, pleaaasee...
You haven't seen the last of me!!!!
Here I am.  Right where you told me to meet you.
My goodness! This has to be the most kind, most generous, most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for-
Eye of newt and frozen sharkskin slab, I hereby curse the Krusty Krab!
Give me one good reason why I should lift the curse.
I said: give me a good reason.
Oh, I like a man who begs.
I will lift the curse, provided you two complete a dangerous task.
Bring me the sacred gold doubloon from the throat of the Giant Golden Eel!
Finally.  Clean free.
There ya' go, the curse is lifted.
You think I'm gonna waste good spells on a bottom-feeder like you? Have a nice day.
