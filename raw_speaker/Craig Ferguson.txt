Hello.
Oh, hey, Patchy the Pirate.
You know, I'm good, I'm good, Patchy. Listen, it would be great to go plunging down memory rapids with you, but I'm kind of busy right now.
Uh, no. No, that's not going to work for me.
Arr!
Arrghh!
Grrr!
That's right, Patchy. I got my own network TV show now.
Actually, we've got a real A-lister tonight. Robin Williams in on.
Where's my bagel?! Bagel!
