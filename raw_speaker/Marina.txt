Hi, Pearl.
Uh, I can't, I have to work at Hot-Dog on a String today. Brad called in sick, so I'm in charge of stringing the dogs. Totally lame.
Ugh.
You should meet the manager, I guess. He's in his office.
Mr. Pepalino, there's someone here for a job.
Hey, Pearl. Over here.
Pearl, you can not be serious.
Hey, girls. I smell moth balls.
Love the shoes, Pearl.
What are you gonna do about it, granny?
It smells like pills and bed pans. Whoa!
It's... so...boring.
Okay, okay, We get it.
We will stop being mean, I promise. Just let us go.
Listen, Pearl. We didn't mean to hurt your feeling or anything.
We just, like, think it's weird that you're, like, a grandma now or whatever. We don't really get it.
