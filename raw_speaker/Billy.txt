Ah, I'm out of here!
Meep.

Stop!
Hello, Handsome.
Hey mommy, who's that weird guy in the car over there!
Aren't you gonna write your name on the board like most professors do?
Well, you know, it just seems like teachers usually write their names on the board the first day of class.
Okay.
Okay, I-I guess.
Okay, so what about the Krabby Kola?
Okay, well then can I just make sure I get those Krabby Fries with extra Krabby Sauce?
Okay, thanks for the directions.
Hey, is that guy still flopping?
Doesn't that get old?
Me too, i'm out.
Sort of the same thing, really.
That, I'd pay to see!
Meep.
Meow.
What are we gonna do?
Under control? Half the city is on fire! You call THAT under control? Huh? Do ya?  The end is near, Mayor.
But, this thing's made out of rusty old paper clips and cardboard!
Deal!
Look at that guy dressed as a hot dog, Mommy.
Look Mommy! It's a guy dressed as a Krabby Patty!
...and they were never heard from again.
Hurry up!  Ha, ha, it's working! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ...
Can I get a Krabby Patty and a large kelp shake, please?  OK, How much do I owe ya?
Mommy, look! Somebody left this toy tractor here.
Ohh, mom.
Yes, get him!
I want my birthday cake!
Cake, cake!
I want my birthday cake!
I want my cake! I want my cake!

If you don't get me my birthday cake, I'll set off all these fireworks!
Gosh, no one ever cared enough about me to explain that. It's like you're my real father.  May I hug you?
Why, father? Why?
Birthday cake!
Hi, Daddy!
Okay, Daddy!
Hah, Daddy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three.
Those guys are dorks.
