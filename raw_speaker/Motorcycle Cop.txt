Sir, I'm going to need to see your license for that, um...
Hmm, I suppose you're right. Carry on, citizen.
I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the boat, ma'am. Do you know why I pulled you over?
What? No. Your vehicle has been outlawed, ma'am.
Now that everyone drives bubble boats, real boats have been deemed too sharp and pointy to be street legal.
Give me that! Bubble boats are too unstable. They've been declared illegal. Everyone back to your regular boats!
