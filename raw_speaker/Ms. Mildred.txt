Oh, my, are you the high-class caterers I hired for an extraordinarily large sum of money?
I do not have time for this tomfoolery. I have a mansion full of very high-class guests waiting for a high-class catering. Are you they or are you nay?
But where are your tuxedos?
Very nice. Here is your payment.
Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs, we seem to be having some problems with the food service.
Oh, my.
Stop it, everyone! You're ruining my par  Oh, no, you did not!
Come back here!
My party!
