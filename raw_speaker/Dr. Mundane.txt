Agnes, please turn down that radio.
I'm Dr. Beige Mundane. You must be Patrick Star. What seems to be the problem?
Let's take a look in your mouth. Open wide, please.
Mm-hmm. I see the problem. Your friend here still has a baby tooth.
Yes.  And the pain is coming from your adult tooth trying to push your baby tooth out of the way.
It's the natural way of things.  If you want the pain to go away, then I need to extract the tooth.
I'm done.
That's it.
