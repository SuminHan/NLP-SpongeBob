I'll take a Double Triple Bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim.
SquarePants.  I hear talk you make a mean Krabby Patty.
Yep.
This is pretty good. Only one thing. You forgot the pickles!
The best there is? I don't think so. You lose!
I believe you owe me two bucks.
Your guarantee.
No.
Afraid not.
I hear SquarePants is back!
I thought I ran you out of town.
Give me the regular. And this time, don't forget the pickles.
Hmm... ...Still no pickles!  See?  You failed again, SpongeBob "Loser"Pants!
And... there's my ride!
Help! Save me!  SAVE ME!
Coming Down.
Thanks, buddy!
You may not like what P-Star7 has to say, but you have to agree that he keeps it "real". He's a true hero for our troubled times.
His vituperative hyperbole has certainly diminished your credibility.
You're right. I should have put it on the bulletin board instead.  Signed, HandsomeLad42.
And the board is never wrong.
"Close your mouth when you eat!"?
Oh, sure you are. P-Star7 has your number alright.
