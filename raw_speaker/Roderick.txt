Hello, worthless students. I'm your new instructor.  No one's ever failed my class... that's lived through it. I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives. Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot. You will drive out of this school in style. Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket. Everyone will follow the rules of the class. First rule: No talking.
Second Rule: no eating in my class. Would anyone care for a bon-bon.
Pick your favorite.  How's it taste?
No eating in my classroom!  Now, if anyone else is man enough to stay in this class...  Looks like you're the man, Sponge.
Do you wanna learn how to drive or what?
What do you think you're doing?
You're not ready to drive yet until you learn that first.  This is  most grueling driving course ever devised. You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it. You'll start out crawling it.
Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. Hut two.
Keep your eyes on the road, cadet.
I'm ashamed of you, cadet.  Tripped up by a wee pebble.  What are you suppose to be learning in my class?
Affirmative. But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl. Then you learn to walk and then you learn to run. But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl.  I want you to crawl!
Now get out there!  Every good boater needs to know his vehicle inside and out.  Here, go take that boat apart.  I'm impressed, son. Put it back together again!
Are you sure?
Jumpin' jellyfish...
How'd you do? Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian... HOW YOU DID!
Not quite.  Now do it blindfolded.
Congratulations. You're ready to get behind the wheel.
Let's see what I taught you, laddy.
Nice driving. Now parallel park up ahead.  Very good.  Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr. Fits what you've learn.
Excellent work, cadet. What's next?
Step 3?
What? You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on. That's illegal.
Drive, boy! Drive!
Mayday! Mayday! You're off course.
The brake son!
I'm gonna stop this thing. Tell my wife I love her.  Come get some!
