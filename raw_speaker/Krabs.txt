Squidward, I'll be back in one hour. I'm going on my lunch break.  Squidward?
Cucumbers. Squirting me. Flying stuff!  Jackpot.  Surely Patrick could spare a few morsels. After all, it's for a worthy cause. Me beloved Pearl.  Don't worry Pearl, Daddy found you some vittles!  Bottom feeders.  Pearl! I brought you some--  cereal.
Ooh-hoo-hoo, foo-foo-foo-food. Gotta find foo-hoo-hoo food!
Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food! Food!  Food.  Not food.  Hanging cured meats. Exotic spices. A breadbox overflowing with baguettes. Yummy stuff everywhere! I'll start with the fridge.  Candied sea yams, pickled urchins, anemone pies, a bucket of kelp slaw.... Et cetera. Ooh, more et cetera.
S-sack?
It's, uh... I'm, uh, practicing to be "Santy Claws"  for the holidays.
Thanks again, officer!
Okay, Pearly, I got some vittles for ya!
I was afraid you were gonna say that.
I wasn't stealing food!
SpongeBob, I'm sorry, I had no other choice. See
G-g-good idea, SpongeBob. That sounds just perfect.
Squidward, wait, you can't.
Because if you do, I'll fire ya.  No, if I go to prison, who's gonna feed Pearl?
Hold it! I'll... I'll...
Oh, SpongeBob, what am I gonna do?
It's not that, boy. Those nerves died years ago. It's me dear daughter, Pearl.
She's going through one of them growth spurts, and I can't find a way to feed her.
Hold on, boy. I said I was trying to feed me daughter, not completely obliterate me inventory.
SpongeBob, hurry it up!
You've been saying that for the last--
Whew! Boy, I'm glad that's over. And it only cost me one Krabby Patty. Say, what was that secret ingredient you used in there, anyways, boy?
Eh?
No SpongeBob, you're right. But, that's a big job, a job that only 2 volunteer employees can do for no extra pay.
Hmm... Nothing's coming out.
Legal?
Hmm..
Plankton 'as had a line of customers... all mornin'!
I've got you now, you slippery demon!  You're putting up a good fight, yes you are.
I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash.  It's the mighty Moby Dollar!  Did you see her boy? I got her! Here she comes!  There she blows!
Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
I did it!  I finally did it!
No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!
No!
Oh SpongeBob...
You're fired!
SpongeBob!
Vroom. Vroom.
