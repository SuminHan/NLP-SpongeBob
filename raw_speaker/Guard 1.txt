Alright, Mrs. Puff, it seems like this heat's gone to your head. If you're gonna talk to rocks, I guess it's time for you to go on kitchen duty.
Talking to inanimate objects again, huh, Puff? Get back to your cell. No more kitchen time for you.
That's just raw material used to make coat hangers. You need some rest.
Whoa. They don't pay me enough to do this job.
What's all the hubbub, Puff?
What the barnacle is going on?
What are you talking about, Puff?
Let's face it, Puff, you've gone off the deep end.  Get in there, you! You need a nice long stay in solitary confinement!
