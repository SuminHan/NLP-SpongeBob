Hungry? I've been asleep for 79 years. Which means my last meal was 79 years ago. Yes, I'm hungry.

Mmm! Now that's a sandwich!
I want dessert! [Plankton parachutes down]
Hey, a chocolate clair! [to audience] Now that looks like dessert to me!
You know, we sea monsters have made great strides in the fields of science and literature.
