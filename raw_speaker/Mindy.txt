Daddy!  You're free to go.
Why do you have to be so mean?
Father, I wish you'd try a little love and compassion instead of these harsh punishments.
Your crown?
It covers your bald spot.
I'm gonna be bald?!
Dad, your "crown"...
Daddy, please. I think you're overreacting.
Daddy, stop it! Can't you get through one day without executing someone?
Where's your love and compassion?  Look at this little guy. He's willing to risk his life to find your crown and save his boss.
Please, Father? At least let him try. What have you got to lose? Might I remind you of your special problem?
Listen, you guys, the road to Shell City is really dangerous. There's crooks, killers and monsters everywhere. And what's worse, there's a giant Cyclops  who guards the outskirts of the city and preys on innocent sea creatures. Don't let him catch you, because if he does, he'll take you back to his lair, and you'll never be seen again.
Here, take this.
It's a magical bag of winds. I stole them from my father.
Once you find the crown, open the bag of winds and you'll be blown back home.
I'm coming. Good luck, SpongeBob.
Oh, I'm gonna be queen of the sea one day. I've learned the names of all the sea creatures.
That's easy. You're Patrick Star.
I gotta go. I believe in you guys.
