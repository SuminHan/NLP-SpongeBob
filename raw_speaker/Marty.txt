Son! You recognized us this time!
You never were a bright one.  Well, aren't you gonna show us inside?
Oh, let me lead the way so we don't get lost.  Huh? Hold hands now!  Okay, we're almost there! Let go on three. One... two... three!
Wow, son! You put the drinks  something this time! Ah, son, you must've been working all night to put these together for us.
Hello there!
Put 'er there.
That's unhealthy.
Does he always do that after he eats?
Uh, Patrick, I think your friend might be broken.
Whoa! Is he gonna be okay?
The boy wears make-up?
Wow, how'd you train him to do that?
Amazing! Three minutes in the kitchen and our son has taught him to talk in complete sentences.  Oh, good work, son!
Hoho, son! You taught him math too!
you taught him to sing!  Oh, now he's short-circuiting! You must have taught him a little too much.
You know, son, I've always known that when it comes to brightness, well, you're about a three-watt. But this guy! He's a wet match in a dark cave. He makes phone operators seem smart!  But more importantly, son, he's shown me what a sharp, quick-witted boy you've become.  Ha! I feel like I'm really meeting you for the first time. Isn't that right, Janet?
Oh, that's right, honey. We don't have a son.
