Hey, SpongeBob's back!
Why are we giving this guy all our stuff?
I want patties, now.
You fool. You've falled into my trap. Now you're mine, SpongeBob the strong.
Hello.
No thanks.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Hey, thanks again, guys. Good luck with the restaurant!
You- you did it!  Do you realize what you've done?
You have freed the city. Citzens of New Kelp, come out of the shadows, 'cause CheeseBoy kicked the Bubble Poppin' gang right out of town!
Yeah. Now what do I do?
Actually, I'd say the show is doing just fine.  At least according to our latest ratings.  This is actually a lot by public access standards. Everyone is working out except for you...  ...you...  ...you...  ...and you!
This is it, son, The Chum Bucket.
No, we're not lost. I promised my boy I'd take him to the Chum Bucket today.
Wow, look at that order window! It's completely covered in grime and filth.
Smell that air!
I think the Chum Bucket is the high point of our tour.
That's right. We're visiting the most disgusting places in bikini bottom. And so far, you're number one. Farewell, you filthy little fella.
So What do ya say we try the city dump next?
Hey, don't you kids want your candy?
This is control station to engine five. Do you copy?
Kid, let me talk to the engineer.
The guy driving the train.
Oh, no.  The train's headed straight for the rest home.  And that means...
It means that train's coming right through that--  Beware the twisted trestles, kid!
That's that.
Uh, it works good when I eat stuff.
Uh, okay.
Really?
Next!
Sorry, only two per car. You'll have to wait for the next car.  Any single riders come to the front!
I also!
Why don't you watch where you're going?!
Excuse me? Could on of you show me how to use this multimeter?
Thanks.
Hey! You!
What? OW!
Ow! OW!
Ow! Ow!
Oh...hey, man! Wha-wha-what was that for? I was trying to give you back your groceries you dropped!
Hey, you stink!
Your water, Serena.
Popcorn! Peanuts!
Snake Eyes...  We love you!
I heard that.
Pineapple.
Yes that is.
My helmet!
I couldn't afford a present this year, so I got you this box.
