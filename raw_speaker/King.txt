Woe is me. Woe is me. Woe is me. What to do? What to do?
Oh, just the same ol' thing dear daughter. It's that wretched wizard Planktonamor. His insidious dragon's destroyed half the kingdom. Soon, there'll be no citizens to tax. Not one of me best knights have been able to defeat him.
Well don't just stand there, send 'em in.
How dare you bark at me in that tone, knave! I am the feared ruler of this kingdom and will be addressed as such.
And why have you brought this fool back into me throne room?
Ohh, alright, alright. But this is your last chance, fool.
Guards, send these slanderers to the guillotine.
That's because you're witches who were sent by Planktonamor to destroy me.
Ok, I'm through playing around. Guards!
What prophecy?
How long has that been there?
How dare you defile my house, demon!  Princess Pearl! I'm coming Pearl. Prepare to meet thy maker, foul beast.
Pearl!  Can no one stop this madness?  You two, my apologies.  Most noble and valiant warriors.
May Neptune grant you safety on your perilous journey to the evil wizard's castle to which no one has escaped alive.
Well, of course, you're the chosen ones. Huh, what's this? A lost piece of the prophecy? Hmmm
Actually, it says I'm supposed to kick you out of here.
On second thought, you better go with 'em. They could use the entertainment.
Good luck strange ones!
Thou must hand over thy village and thy throne or thy daughter shall be dipped into a cauldron of lava?! Pearl!!
Order up!  Hmmm, I doth wonder if I could sell these, uhh, Krabby Patties.
Ahem!  Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play!  Oh do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
I came here here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
Ahem!
Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
