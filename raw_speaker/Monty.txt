Hello, there.
Good day, sir.
Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners. My name is Monty P. Moneybags.
The one and only.
I'm on a shopping spree. Buying art for my new museum.
I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection.
Because, it's an art collection.
More like: Belongs in the Trash.
Maybe I should be... huh? What is that?
Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship. This is the work of a true genius. Hello? What this? This is the only flaw.  Ah, that's more like it. I simply must find the artist responsible. He shall have fame.
Fortune.
Anything his heart desires.
I can see it now. Your name in the world's most prestigious museums. I'm gonna make you, immortal!! Now, uh, help me get this in the car.
Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. You can whip up another one.
Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks.
I'm here for the... what the? Who is responsible for this?
You, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived!
