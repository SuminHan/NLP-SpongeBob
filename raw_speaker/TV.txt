In his office space, Mr. Normal, at least that's what it says on his name tag works at a steady and monotonous pace just as all the other normals do. Take note of how they communicate with each other.
At the end of the day Mr. Normal packs his things and goes home to merrily start the cycle again in the morning.
Hey, you! Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy! "Oh, I'm a little peanut worm." Are you too much of a wimp to work out? Are you a weakling built like a sponge? Well, now you too can have muscles.
With Anchor arms!  They slip on like a glove. Just add air.  How big do you want 'em?  Normal?  Veiny? And for the ladies...  ...hairy.  I was a wimp before Anchor arms. Now, I'm a jerk and everybody loves me. So order now, wimp!
Yeah, shopping's weird. Did you ever go into the seafood aisle and say Who eats this stuff?"
We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of .
