Chocolate bars, eh?
Ha! A couple of mediocre salesmen if you ask me. That's no way to carry your merchandise!
No, no no no, WRONG. You guys wanna be good salesmen, right?
Well,  no self respecting candy bar salesman would be caught dead without one of these!
It's a candy bar bag, you knuckle-head! It's specially designed to cradle each candy bar in velvet-lined comfort!
BUT, I'm wasting my time.  You don't need these bags.
So long, boys! Happy hunting!  Suckers...
Yes?
I... don't recall. But it looks to me like you fellas have got a lot of bags there. You two lady killers are too smart to be without one of my patented Candy Bar Bag Carrying Bags.
