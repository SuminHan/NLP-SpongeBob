Yes, oh, it's absolutely...
Sorry, yellow box, Patrick has to make a personal appearance at the mall.
Would you buy it, though?
He loves it.
It's just past the solid gold gym. Take a right at the zoo.
He can find the kitchen by himself. The press needs some photos of you with your new mascot friends.
Excuse me, yellow box, Mr. Star is not to be disturbed. He's very, very busy right now.
You're a star. You have no friends.
Okay, and here. And here. Okay, and then sign here. And again here.
Come on, Mr. Star. You've got an 11:00 eyeball waxing.
