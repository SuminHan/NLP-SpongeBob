Behold! We are the Greek Chorus! We narrate this epic tale of stupidity!
Behold Neptune, god of the sea,  with his mighty trident, a weapon so powerful,  nothing is beyond its user's reach! Behold the Kraken!  Gross monster.
Behold Neptune triumphant!  What an awesome dude!  Behold this idiot and beware, for trident trouble comes!
See?
No! And it is not a spatula.
The sponge has angered the trident.  Trouble comes.
Magic, magic, magic.
Whoa, slow your roll! Only Neptune, true ruler of the sea, can control the trident.
No, you'll only make it worse!
See?
You really don't. How do you not get that by now?
We told you so.
Too long away from its true master, the trident has run wild.
