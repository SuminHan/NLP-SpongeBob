Aha!  "Booby Traps"?  Oh. There you are, my lovely.  What's that? Take the book? I don't mind if I do.  At last, it is mine. Finally, you are mine.  All right. Let's do this. Bare Knuckles.  Bring it on, skinny. You don't scare me.
Is that all you got?!  Man, this is way overdue.  Once upon a time, under the sea, there was a little town called,  "Bikini Bottom."  In this town, there was a place called, [A CGI Krabby Patty is shown.][The scene cuts to the Kitchen of The Krusty Krab. The grill, counter next to the grill, and fryer are shown. Here, seven Krabby Patties are being grilled and fries are being cooked.][The scene shows a different angle of the same scene, where the fryer is the focus of the shot.][The scene shows a counter with a dispenser of ketchup, a stack of tomato slices, two tomatoes, a cut tomato with a slice, a jar of pickles, a head of lettuce with a few pieces cut off, a stack of onion slices, a pile of puns, a bag of potatoes, two whole onions, and a cut onion.][The scene cuts to a medium shot of the kitchen. Spat starts to descend into the shot.][SpongeBob pops in and his Krusty Krab hat and spatula fall to his head and hand, respectively.]
Hold it. Just hold it.
Stop!   There's only one thing worse than talking birds, and that would be... Singing Birds!
Come closer. Let me tell you the tale.
Not  close!  All right. Here we go.  Now, SpongeBob loved his job as a fry cook more than anything.  And that is saying a lot. Because he loved everything!  He loved his pet snail, Gary.  He loved his best friend, Patrick.   He loved blowing bubbles...  ...and jellyfishing.
He loved making Krabby Patties for the folks in Bikini Bottom.. ...just as much as they loved eating them.  "Why," you may ask, "do they love this greasy meal sandwich so much? Why did they eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner...  "...despite the doctor's warnings?"
Ah, it was a secret.  No one was sure what was in those patties that made them so delicious. And frankly, no one cared, except for Plankton.
Plankton owned a restaurant right across the street from the Krusty Krab, where no one ate...  ...because the food was really bad!
Plankton had made it his life's work to steal the recipe.
But SpongeBob was always there to protect it. But today...  ...things would be different.
And so, Bikini Bottom became an apocalyptic cesspool forevermore. The end!
Oh, of course it is. I'll show you. Just turn around.
The end!
And so, it would seem that our heroes have accomplished all they had set out to do.
Oh, no. That's not the end.
Land ho!
Yeah! All right, you feathered rats, time to shove off!
Well, I can't have you pooping all over my restaurant, can I?
Oh, it . But it is also...  A-ha! My very own food truck.
Uh, you know, a restaurant on wheels.
No! Are you trying to scare away my customers?
No problem. You guys like a little snack while you wait?
Who wants some hot wings?
Which one of you is next?
Boo!
How did you get here? You cannot breathe air.
Wait! Wait.  That's not in the book.
There's no magical dolphin in this story.
The story of how Bikini Bottom was brought to its knees when its beloved Krabby Patty formula was stolen by me, Burger Beard.
Well, let me see. It looks like, um, Burger Beard becomes the richest food truck proprietor in all of the land.
That was easy. I simply rewrote the story and...  Poof!
Watch this.  The brave and handsome Burger Beard banished...  our poor heroes to be stranded on Pelican Island!  The end!
But... I banished you.
Hey, hey, wait! Hold on! Hold on! Wait! Wait! Customers!
Let's see you get out of this one!
NO! My book!
There she blows.
Oh no, you don't.
Come here.
I'm going to scrub my armpits with you.
Duh.
Ha! It's all MINE!
This will make you feel a little butter.
!
Why don't you get going, little fella, before you hurt yourself?
Come on. Team up with me. We'll be rich and powerful! Huh?
Oh, Kyle... How can I say no to you?  Are you ready, kids?!
Uh, what did you say? There's sand in my ears and I can't hear you!
