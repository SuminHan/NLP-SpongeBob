My, you're such a gentleman.
My date was supposed to bring me to the bank...  ...but he stood me up!
My knight in shining exoskeleton!
Cashina. You're very sweet.
I'd love to...
This food is so delicious. Oop! You don't suppose it has a secret formula.  I don't suppose  know anything about secrets... or formulas.
Yeeeess...?
Oh, Eugene. This is all moving so fast...
Be gentle!
Pearl, I... love your rouge.  How chic!
Well, Pearl, I love your shoes.
Oh, uh... heh...  I have some cream for that.
Well, Pearl, since I'm seeing your father, I hope we can learn to understand each other.
No. I think I should do this alone.
...and I was all, "You call this a mugging?" And then I suplexed him until he gave me my purse back!
Yes! Yes!
Eugene, you have everything I've ever wanted with a man: An exoskeleton, freakishly long eyestalks, and the secret krabby patty formula.
Oh no, what about the bouquet?
Eugene, I don't want there to be any secrets between us.
Not those kinds of secrets.
I want you to tell me... (scheming smile face) the secret Krabby Patty formula!
The secret formula... is locked away in your heart. Unlock your heart for me, Eugene. Let me in
