And this is Lord Reginald.
We are the board of directors of Tree Dome Enterprises Limited, and we are here to ascertain if Miss Cheek's inventions are up to snuff.
Quite. And whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?
Where is Miss Cheeks?
This is where our research money went?
Yes, how do we know this contraption works?
Lord Reginald, are you all right?
Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick, what is the meaning of this?
Lord Reginald, are you all right?
We shall commence closure of this establishment immediately.
We are departing, Dr. Marmalade.
Try it again.
Well, Miss Cheeks, I must say you have exceeded expectations.
I expect great things out of you, Miss Cheeks. Great things.
