Citizens of New Kelp City. I don't know much about politics or balanced budgets or how to be a "leader". I'm not exactly sure what a mayor is, but I do know this, while I am wearing the mayor's hat it will always be safe to blow bubbles on the streets of new kelp or my name isn't CheeseHead BrownPants.
What's that?
Oh, this is a surprise.
No, surprised at seeing a talking weasel.
Sorry, Sandy. But I'd probably remember another underwater, talking weasel.
I have no idea how that got there. All I remember is hitting my head, blowing some bubbles and now, poof, I'm mayor.
Uh, sorry, weasel girl, I can't leave. These people need my leadership. In fact I'm late for a meeting.
Nope.
I was a fry cook before?
