Charmed.
An automatic back scratcher, hair comber, nose picker, ukulele tuner. Yes, well I've heard that claim before.
Me?  Are you sure this is safe?
Oh, I say, this is splendid.  Oh, absolutely splendid. What's this?  Oh, marvelous. This machine has evacuated my nostrils of unwanted residue in a manner most pleasant.
Oh, I say, now it's feeding me delicious pudding!
Now it's tuning my ukulele!  Ouch! Ooh! I say, was that necessary?  You, sir, are impertinent.  Oh, dear.
Ouch.
I seem to have ruptured my pomposity.
Oh! It is! It is! It's the banana peeler we have been searching 117 years for!
It may be the extreme head trauma I've suffered, but I am going to offer you a 20-year contract with a substantial pay raise.
Perhaps you could put your talents toward that automatic poop-throwing machine that's eluded us for so long.
