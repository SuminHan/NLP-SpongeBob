Hey there, home-dads.
Welcome to our remote island.
That's right, kemosabay. Island. Although, we sometimes refer to it as an... island.
The ocean works in mysterious ways.
Mysterious waves.
Oh, we've been here since we dropped out of junior college. This is Awesome Eddie, Big G...
Chip, and Silent Stan.
And I'm Twitch.
What?
Guano.
Yo, you're miles from the tourist track now, dude.
Go!
Well, dudes, I give up.
These ho-dads are impossible to teach.  Especially the one on the end over there.
He reminded us that there is one dude who could possibly teach you. If you can find him.
His name  is Jack Kahuna Laguna. Or JKL, for short.
We say that legend says that JKL was last seen up-river at the Kahmamoku Cove, where every wave is perfect.
No problem. And just keep following the river straight up until you hit Kahmamoku Cove. Can't miss it.
Well, we don't know cause we've never ever been there.
Yeah, interpret that any way you want.
Grab a guitar, dude! Let's party!
Hey there, home dads.
Welcome to...
..Kimoswabey, Island. Although we are prefer to as... Island.
..ways.
Mysterious waves.
This is Awesome Eddy...
