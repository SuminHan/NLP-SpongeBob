Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs! Your secret formula is finally mine!
You'll never catch me, Krabs, not after I switch into maximum overdrive!  Hi-ya!  I knew I should have gotten the turbo.  Hear me Krabs! You'll take this Krabby Patty from me when you pry it from my cold, dead...
Oh, uhh, it says,  'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.'  How interesting.
Can I have the secret formula?
Okay.
Pretty please?
AH-HAH!
That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!
...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far.
Curse you,  Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
You just wait, Krabs! Next time I'll... ah, who am I kidding? At least I can go home to a wife who understands.
I don't want to talk about it.
Leave me alone.
And she's off, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm a failure!
Henchmen?
I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language!  Felicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles! Who will join me!?
I don't get it. No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me.
That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea.  The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny!  Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand!  But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds!  They're here! Welcome, brethren!
I've been away from home longer than I thought.
Uh...
Alright! I get it! I mean, uh, come inside. Make yourself at home.  I'd like you to meet my computer wife, Karen.
Yes, that's my first name.
Will you please-!
All right, as I was saying...  Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name.
Good. Ahem, to continue.  Only you can bring honor...  ...and dignity...  ...back to the Plankton name.  For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for...  Aha!  Okay, that's enough!  Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula. What do you think?
Well, what do you want?
Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink!  Victory, thy name is Plankton!
Attention Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking.
I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab!
What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs!
GRASS?!?
You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula.
Silence!  I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys?  That's it, a little to the left...
Hot dog!  Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine!  Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!
Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family.
Begging won't help.
Eye.
I don't care. Drum roll please!  Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good.  The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!
...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!
...A cup of love...!
...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...!  ...Plankton?!
Open 24 hours, eh? I knew he couldn't resist staying open later than me.  My evil plan is working perfectly. He'll run his employees into the ground, and when SpongeBob's mind finally cracks from exhaustion, I'll get him to tell me the secret Krabby Patty formula.  Why aren't you laughing?
Drats! He's not collapsing from exhaustion, but with a little more pressure, the Sponge will crack like an egg , and I'll be there to feast on the goo of his shattered psyche.
Come on!
Eh...no.
Come in, Mr. SquarePants. Please have a seat on the couch.  Now...  Let's unload all that harmful information in your little yellow head.
Hope, hope? When I get my hands on that formula, there won't be any hope for any of you.  Yeah, I mean: you'll be cured in no time.
Let's start with a simple exercise.
I want you to close your eyes.  Tighter  Tighter  Too tight! Now, tell me what you see?
Good, and what are they made of?
No, I mean ingredients. What are the stinking ingredients?
Wait, where'd you get that piano?  We're trying something else. I'm going to say a word and I want you to say the first word that pops into your head. Ready?
Work.
Spatula.
Bun.
See, the key is to say something different than what I say.
Potato
Tomato
I've laid out some words on cards here. These words are common kitchen ingredients. I want you to arrange them in any order you choose. It could be a poem or a secret formula. I don't knowoh yes! A secret formula. Good, let's do that.
Oh, o.k.  I'll be over here, then.
Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you.
No, hypnosis.
Now, keep your eyes on this watch.  When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3.  I can't believe it worked. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awake and tell me the formula.  Hey, wake up!  Hmm, what else is loud and obnoxious?  Why won't you wake up?!
Wake up!
But what about the formula.
No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work. You're still sick! Very, very sick!
And so passes another sleepless night, haunted by my inability to steal even a single Krabby Patty.
Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife.
Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen?  I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula...
Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?
Oh, the pain! I can't feel my arms and legs! I think they're broken. I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering.
Well...if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence.
See you in court, Krabs! Uh, I mean...  oh the pain! The deep-frying pain!
I'll give you one last chance. I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula.
Oww, oww! My wittle arm!
Oww! My other arm!
Yes, your honor. I'll try.  I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today.  I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell.
Then came the fateful day that I paid an innocent visit to the deathtrap known as the Krusty Krab.
Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor  that had been intentionally  covered with a viscous fluid.
Ahem! Are you quite finished?  Now where was I, oh yeah. But the worst part is...my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed.  I'm...I'm sorry Gram-Gram...sorry.  Thank you for your kind attention.  Suckers.
Mr. Krabs, can you identify this item?
Do you own one?
No more questions.
To, you know. Say hello to my once good friend, Mr. Krabs. What?
Uhh...uhh...uhh  I can't take it! Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!  Yippee! Finally it's mine!
Huh? No, no, no!
No, no, no, no!
Oh, good, the lunch rush. Now that my ChumBot has dropped you into my clutches, you'll be forced to eat at the Chum Bucket.
C'mon, it's a standard marketing technique.
Hey!
Karen?! You think I'm a twerp?
Everything I do is always wrong in your eyes.
Fine, I'm wrong and you're right.
Why did I ever install that nagging software?
Why did I ever buy that computer wife? I need a real woman--not a girl in a cold-hearted shell.  Such beauty. She's an angel; and no wires. I've never felt like this before. I don't even know her name and yet she's stolen my heart.
You're a W.I.F.E.. Wired Integratred Female Electroencephlagraph.
Why don't you have an 'off' switch?
And now to woo that beloved creature.
Hmmm, I guess she's not a poetry fan. [heart] Poetry, love notes--nothing's working. Perhaps something personal.
Oh, yeah...I am smooth.  Just dial the number and ask her to dinner. C'mon, you can do this.
Wait! This is your secret admirer.
No. I program the robot. Did you enjoy the gift I sent you?
It was...just a lucky guess. I've admired you from afar for far too long, my angel. We must meet face-to-face.
Sounds wonderful. I'll be the tall fellow wearing a red carnation. Until tonight, my dear.
I've reservations for two, tonight.
Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!
Is my tie on straight?
Hello, my dear. I must say you look ravishing tonight.
Well, I'm in the food service business. I'm a bit of a restaurateur. I'm the founder and owner of the Chum Bucket.
It's across the street.
It's on the back of the phone book! Come on! I paid a lotta money for that ad!  Never mind, Never mind. I'd like to hear about you.
Krabs!
"Mommy?"
This delectable creature is your mother?
Boyfriend?
You heard the lady. Let me go.
That's more like it.
Eugene.
I'm serious, Eugene. I've changed my ways. And all it took was the love of a beautiful woman.
What are you talking about?
Your mother knows the Krabby Patty formula?
Not family, eh? I can fix that.
Somebody call heaven because I think an angel's gone missing.
Oh, Mrs. Krabs.
Attention, attention everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. Mrs. Krabs, in full view of this restaurant, I ask you for your hand in holy matrimony.
Would you marry me?
Gasp![actually says the word]
Too late Krabsy. We're going to be married. And you're gonna be my new son!  Huh? What's this, honey bunch?
What is this? There's somebody else, isn't there?
I don't believe this! You led me on!
I don't want to hear your lies! You owe me for leading me on like this! Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even.
No, no, not really. I mean, not at first. I mean uh...honey bunch? Uh-oh.  Oh, well, 'tis better to loved and lost then never to be loved at all!
So, you decided to come crawling back to me, huh?
Nothing, dear.
Psst...  I, Man Ray, have returned from the murky depths to seek my revenge and banish your souls to the nether regions. Their defenses are strong, but they are no match for my Man Ray ray.
SpongeBob, this role was made for me.
I thought Sandy was the boom operator.
All right, SpongeBob, but you're squandering my talents.
Give it back!
This is humiliating. I'm not good at this boom thing.
I have presented you with a monetary offering as custom dictates. My wish, ne my command, is to be taller. Just a little? Just big enough to crush my enemies, like the vermin they are!
Morning, SpongeBob. Krabs. Beautiful day.
I surrender!
There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?
Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!
Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it.  Let me show you something.  Look at this place!
What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?
Well, there he is.  That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into...  this!
No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up.
I'm serious, Krabs. Soon the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum.
Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career.
Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items.
Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop.
Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe.
Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed.  Those were the days, huh Eugene?
But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.
Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways.
Thanks, but no.
Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine.
Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.
GET OUT!!
What's this?  Hey, Krabs!
You forgot something.  Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy.
Coming, coming.  Yo.
Eugene?
Hey.
Yes. I'm still here.
Sure.
So, what's this about, Krabs?
Yes. Yes, I would like that very much.  I guess I won.
Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you.
Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me.
Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts.
I can't believe you would even think...
You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt.
You sure?  Life is good, Krabs.
Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo!  I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked! I should've been a politician.
Pardon me, I've done nothing wrong.
Holy Moley, how'd that happen?
Really?! Wait a minute! That's my job!  Blast it! It's bad enough I have to compete with this joker. Now there's this?! KelpShakes.
No, not another secret. And if there's a secret, I want to know about it!
They're multiplying. Why, they're on every corner.
They're everywhere.
Just stick to the plan.
Let's do this thing.
My eye, my eye, my eye!
Of course I do.
You better believe it. This high-powered mechanical bio-arm I invented should pry those restaurant doors open nice and easy.  What the barnacles? Come on, you piece of garbage.  Ouch! Uncle! Uncle!
Krabs, pipe down. You're gonna soil our plans if you wake up the watchdog.
Now we have to fix the roof. [winks]
Keep her going, Krabs. At this rate, we'll have the Kelpshake's recipe faster than you can say...
Let's beat it!
Wait, you forgotten...  I'm throwing in the towel, Krabs! All these convoluted plans are getting us nowhere. And to top it all off, I'm the only one that's taking the heat!
I don't see you on the front lines. Sure, let me do all the work, while you just sit back like the fat gorilla you are!!
It's easy. Just smile and hand the cashier the money.
Good luck.
Release your grip, man. Do it!
Oh, believe it, Krabs. Now let's get to the lab and find out what this stuff is made of.  What's the secret ingredient, Karen?
You? What about me? If anyone, I deserve to make a buck of selling this stuff.
Not if I can help it.  Ow.
Really? Let me try that.  Actually, there is a bit of a pungent aftertaste.
Well, don't be selfish.  Oh yeah.
Krabs, we're all out of juice.
Look at us!
I don't know about you, [Plankton takes out a mini helicopter propeller] but I'm going back to what I do best. Stealing your recipe.
Come to papa.
It's good to be home.
I love being hated.
Surprise!
Happy Birthday Krabs!
You'll rue the day we were born, Krabs. I'll be back.  Oh, barnacles.
Goo!
Yeah. You can buy things with it.
Valuable customers coming through.
Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipper burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.
Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school!
Gently. Gently.
There you are, sir.
Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.
I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds!
Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world!  And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!
Stop! You're gonna bust it!
I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?
Oh, either one will do.
Lies!
Very touching, but completely false.
Why don't you tell them the truth?
Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory.
But what about satisfying the customers?
Gimme that!
This isn't about money, Eugene.
You'll regret this one day!  Ouch.  Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.
It was only our third date.
Now that's a handsome looking burger.
What's that music?
Well, he is old.
Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.
You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.
Stop, you're gonna...  You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget!
I think not, Rag Boy.
Get out of my face!
Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.
Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir.
Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think!
I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop till I do!
You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me.
My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.
It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?
I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy.
Now, Karen!  Back off, Rag Boy.
Go, Karen!
Excuse me?  Do you have anything in a size negative five?
Would you stop making all that racket?
Whew! Gosh, it's hot.  AAAAAAAAH!
Whew. Huh?
Secret mission, eh?  Don't you think I know what you're up to? You want to eat at the Chum Bucket without your boss knowing. Karen, we've got a customer!  I'll let you two look over the menu.
Could I interest you in a raspberry iced tea?
Or perhaps a bran muffin?
Prune Danish?  What the...?  Destroy my lab, will ya, Krabs? Well, if it's war you want, it's war you'll get!
Oh, I will. We'll see if you have any customers left after I pump up the volume.
Do your worst, Krabs!
Pointy-headed projectile on the port side!
I win! I always win!
No, SpongeBob, I always...
No, you idiot.
I almost had it 37 times, and you know it!
You've got the easy part. I'd like to see you do my job.
Ha! The usual wager?
Here you go, Eugene.  One a-dollar.
That's right. run, Krabs. For I have found your Achilles heel. I'll freeze you out of business and I'll do it using your thermostat!  What the--? Oh, no. Code red! Abandon ship!  No matter. In four to six hours, I will have my revenge.
That crusty old barnacle might keep me from the secret formula, but I'd like to see him serve a Krabby Patty when I'm done with this place.  Into every life, a little rain must fall, Krabs. its just business.  Well, maybe it is personal.  I'm touching your thermostat! I'm touching your thermostat!
I knew you'd be too stubborn to turn the heat up. Let's see how long you keep those customers when you give them the cold shoulder.
Yes, flee that frozen wasteland. Warmth and joy have left your lives.  Hey, buddy. you want to eat The Chum Bucket?  Fine! At least Krabs' place is deserted. Hey! The customers are coming back.  I don't understand. What's bringing them back?  What the--?
No! How is this possible? I freeze this place solid and he turns it into an ice rink. He's making more money than ever.
Well, if it isn't the wind beneath my wings.
I'll be right back.
I did it. I finally got a Krabby Patty.
Hey, SpongeBob. long time, no see. What've you been up to? How was your weekend?
Fascinating. Well, got to go.
Better luck next time, SpongeBob.
Uh-oh.  Whoa!
Yes, I'm going to make it.
On the contrary, It is I who has you.
Run, you fools. Run!  It's working. I'm actually going to get a Krabby Patty.  Come on, get out of the way! You're blocking the exit.  No! No!
I'm not giving up yet, Krabs. I've still got my secret weapon.  The thermostat!
That's right, Krabs. It was I who froze The Krusty Krab.  See?
You see, Krabs. you can't defeat me.
Oh, brother. Just look at this place. Might as well be a mausoleum. Abysmal. Oh, well. at least it's structurally sound.  Forget this! I'm sick of not having any business.
Okay, I get it. I get it. It's time to give this place a complete overhaul.  Whoa! Whoa!  I shouldn't have to subject myself to such menial labor.  Ah! This is a job for an imbecile!  Or two imbeciles.  Excuse me, gentlemen. I am sorry to bother you, but I'm having a bit of trouble with my abode. You see, I would like to paint The Chum Bucket to please my wife. But alas, I am too small and feeble.
Okay, boys. Karen wants this place to really sparkle. I was thinking it could use a little more pizzazz.
Oh, I know. Why don't you paint the entire Chum Bucket?
Oh, yes. I need you artistic vision. You, wouldn't want to disappoint my Karen, now would you?
Well, hop to it, lads.
Amazing. I didn't have to trick the tall one.  My plan is falling right into place. With those three boobs preoccupied, stealing the formula will be a snap!
Let me show you something, SpongeBob.  I sure wish I could offer you a cold drink for all your hard work. But alas, my pipes are rusted shut.
Yes. If only there was some way I couldWhere'd he go?
Secret formula, here I come.
Perfect. Huh?  No! No! No! It's all wrong! Don't you know a thing about art? Gimme that brush!  Yes, yes, and yes.
Yeah, I think they're so cozy. Now that's what you call art.
I can't wait to see Krabs' face when he discovers that I've absconded with The Krabby Patty secret formula.
SpongeBob, how do you expect me to see out of a window that high?
See, SpongeBob. Patrick's using the old noggin. He knows I'll actually want to see out the window.
Can't you two do anything right?! I give you one simple task after another andJust forget it. It was foolish of me to think this plan would ever work when nothing else in my life is panned out. Telemarketinglife guardingcreative writingall such bitter failures.
Really?
Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while.
I just need to sneak past Krabs, and I'm home-free.  Where could that stingy crab be?  Still don't see him.  The safe! I'm in the clear, baby!  It's beautiful.  No, no tears. Not yet.  There's work to be done.  Ha-ha! At long last!  And the secret formula isone bottle of molting lotion, take passport photo, get new safe . This isn't the secret formula! It's a to do list!  Huh? What happened to The Krusty Krab? Huh? What happened to The Chum Bucket?!  Curses! This isn't what I meant by renovation.
Well, steal is such a strong word.
...restaurant, bug. I think we've been through this one before. Allow me to do the honors.
Don't nag me, Karen. I've had a long day.
Ha!
Krabs!
How'd you know it was me?
Hmmm... perhaps a peppershaker was a bit obvious.
AAHH!
Never! Never! I'll never get Krabs' formula! Mr. Krabs is too stupid and is too powerful! If only there were a way to render him helpless!
Hey, I resent that!
Something about that woman reminds me of my mother. That's it! Finally, victory will be mine! I'll turn Eugene Krabs into a powerlessbaby.
I've done it! Nothing can stop me now! My goo goo gas will transform Krabs into a tiny helpless infant!  The key to the Krusty Krab. This is easier than I hoped.  He's a little bigger than I imagined.  Ow! Ow! Ow!
Hello! If you're done making a total fool out of yourself, I could use some help with this lock.
Yes, my plan is working perfectly, now that I've turned Krabs into a helpless baby, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine! Hello.
Fools, you'll never hold me! Your primitive shackles are no match for my genius.  I'm free! Free!
and then that blasted sponge called the cops! That's just not cricket.  Now I'll never be a tyrannical overlord.
Not sure.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Now you're just talking gibberish. What I really need is to spray Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob.
I don't wanna hear all your loony schemes, Karen. I've got work to do!
Hands in the air!
That's right, SpongeBob, I'm back! And you won't stop me this time.  What? SpongeBob's a baby but Krabs is back to normal  It seems the second dose acts as an antidote! [he is turned back into a baby again] One squirt equals baby, two squirts equals adult!  Or is it three squirts for baby and four squirts for adult.  Barnacles, I've run out of gas!
Krabs! Nice diaper.  Come on, come on!  I've got it!
Peek-a-boo!
This!  What's the matter, baby? Are you gonna cry?  What the heck happened to you? This isn't baby gas! It's senior citizen spray!
Out of my way, Methuselah! You're old and useless.
I'm getting old listening to this. Let's try this again!
This baby gas is worthless! At least you're way too old to stop me from stealing a Krabby Patty!
It'll take more time to explain than you have left.
Victory is mine!
That was almost too easy.  No! I demand you geezers release me!
What?
1 squirt equals baby, carry over the 2 plus the square root of SpongeBob. Of course! The final ingredient I'm lacking! It's so simple yet so evil! And I know just where to get it.
Excuse me, what aisle did you get that from?
No, that thing! The ugly drippy smelly thing.
Ow ow ow!  Baby powder? This could be just what I need! Hey buddy, is this made of real or artificial babies?  Ow ow ow ow!  That powdered baby did the trick! Now my baby gas can't possibly fail!
What is it now, Karen?
That's an excellent idea. And I know just the guinea pig!
Karen! Speak to me!  It worked!
Everyone say your ABCs!  Now when you turn into babies,  you stay babies! Hey, Krabs, catch!
My moment of triumph!  What the...?  Oh, gross! I command you to stop drooling on me!
Put me down!  Ow! Stop it! I'm an adult!
Yeow!  Huh? I don't believe it! Krabby Patty Formula! He's teething on it!  Give it here, you big stupid baby!  Ow.  I've got it! Just like taking candy from a baby! Get it, Krabs? I'm taking candy from   Hey! What are you doing?  Uh-oh.  Ahem!  Mama's evil little genius needs a
Ha, ha ha. Such a valiant desire - hehehe. The lost weapons of Atlantis - the most advanced of all time. As soon as this dopey song is done I plan to make them miiiiine!
They're gone. Now to get to those weapons...  Trapped! Ok, what do I have to work with here? What's this? Owners manual!? Looks like I found my escape route!  Owe!
These Atlanteans leave a room full of the most advanced weaponry unguarded? No wonder they got lost.  Oh, my! There will be no one to stop me this time!
Cower to me fools! I have commandeered the most powerful weapon in the Atlantean arsenal! Now bow before the new king of Atlantis and prepare to taste my wrath!  Yeah! Huh? Uh, uh I mean, uh, prepare to taste my wrath!  Oh, you!  Prepare to taste my wrath!
Ice cream? It shoots ice cream?!?  Oversized ice cream maker!  Yah! Ouch! Ow!
I'll destroy all of you--
You haven't seen the last of me! When I get out of here I'll hunt you all down like a pack of--  Hey! Can't you read?  No flash photography!
Krabs calls that a commercial? Who'd fall for that schlock?  Say... Something is going on over there.
Never trust kids, Squidward. Never trust kids.
Stupid kid. Wait a minute, what's this?  Karen?  My own wife?!  Oh, how Krabs mocks me.
What's that? A souvenir from your boyfriend Krabs?
Wha...?!  Thanks, babe. You're too good to me.  A Mermaid Man action figure...And a Barnacle Boy eraser?!  Look at me. I'm Barnacle Boy. Look at me. I'm Mermaid Man.  Krabs!  Sure! Why didn't I think of this before? If Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy can build Krabs up, they can tear him down, too.  Ding dong.  Hello, boys.
I'm Down Here, Fellas!
Oh, Professor Plankton, Door-to-door salesman.  My card.
, you two look like a couple of ladies' men, am I right?  I knew it! Just look at that heroic chin.  Those chiseled features.  That bra.  But what's this? Dandruff?
You sure do.  See?
Ew!  Couple of studs like you can't go around like this. Lucky for you, Dr. Plankton's come prepared with "Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo". A little of this stuff and the ladies will be breakin' down your door.
Wise decision, gentlemen.  Hey, what do we have here? You fellas look a little peaked.  Hmm, this shouldn't be. I wonder.  Say, this isn't Professor Plankton's Dandruff Control Shampoo! It's Professor Plankton's  Mind Control Shampoo!  With conditioner. Time to prepare for your next role, fellas, as my zombies!
Oh, boy! Everyone in Bikini Bottom showed up! This is gonna be so sweet.
Ooh! This is too easy. Now just tell everyone that...
They're terrible! You hate Krabby Patties.
Oh, for crying out loud!  Tell them you hate Krabby Patties!
...let it be known that I, Mermaid Man prefer the delicious food available at the Chum Bucket.
Yes. Yes!   It's working.
Oh, no. Those infernal Krabby Patties. Their grease-fried deliciousness could be enough to free Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
I did it! I did it! Look at all these customers.  In your face, Krabs. Yes!
Food? Oh, yeah. Never thought I'd get this far.
Hey, everyone, I made Chummy Joes!
A traveling restaurant, eh? It's not fair! I had that idea years ago! No matter. If Mr. Krabs wants to play dirty, then Plankton's ready for his turn to take his turn.
Those nincompoops are better salesmen than I suspected.
Hello, little boy. Would you like a chum burger?
Um, no.
No.
Ah, come on, kid. You asked me that already. Now quit wasting my time!
I'm Plankton, you old hag. And your son smells like boogers.
I think it's time for you to lose some weight, fatty. That's what this is.
Someone should put you in a box floating down the river, Grandma!
You people are crazy. I'm getting out of here.  What the? [People start throwing rocks] No! Controls malfunctioning! [people continue to throw rocks]
Yes! Yes!
Now that those two are out of the picture, all of the customers will come running to me. [literally] This calls for drastic-er-est measures! [Plankton goes into the abyss] Okay, you bums, time for the second course; Chum Charges!
Yes! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the Krusty Krab! I sunk the...  Ah, who needs that old Rust Bucket anyhow.
Don't give another penny to those fast-food phonies. That's right, they stole my idea. My, my, my... [the end of the periscope breaks off, he falls down and rolls into some wet mud]
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You- You've got it all wrong, see... Hey!
Happy day, Karen! That fool Krabs changed the name of his restaurant to the closed Krab! Everyone will think it's closed, and come eat here instead! He'll be ruined by tomorrow!  What an idiot!
What?
Banned? Then that means, my day of reckoning has come at last! I won, I tell you! I've won! And what better way than by default?
Oh, out to celebrate.  Don't wait up for me!
Excuse me, gents! But what's with all the hullabaloo?
Krabby Patty?!
What are you talking about, you gargantuan buffoon?
Curse you!
So, Mr. Krabs is operating under the table, huh? Well, two can play at that game!
Being a ruthless mastermind sure takes a lot outta here.
Cops, I need you!
Darn it! Argh! Once again, so close and yet so far! When am I gonna- oh!
Oh dear.
Good morning, Mr. SquarePants!
I can't believe it! That fool Krabs hiring the blood relative of his best worker!  Well, that's the end of me.
Ha-ha! Those fools will never find me now!  Oh come on, baby. You know how long I've been in stir.
After everything I've done for you.
Well, that's just great.  Hey! It's my old guitar. I used to play it, when I was in that band, as a kid. Man, those were good times.  Okay everybody! One two one two three!  You know, I don't think I've had any good times.
He's singing about the Krabby Patty. If I could just get him to explain that song, I'll have the Krabby Patty formula!
Hi, SpongeBob.
That's a real nice song.
But could you explain those "wee" parts?
Gahh!  Are you out of your mind? Er, I mean, that was a delightful song you were singing.
Oh, that's terrible. Krabs shouldn't stifle a true artist like you! Go ahead and sing your patty song uncensored!
What, me? I'm not trying to steal the patty formula!
What band? I don't have a band.
Songs?  Yes! And you can teach me your Krabby Patty songs!
Sure, whatever.
Hmm? Uh yea, great.
Greetings, fellow band-mates.
T-shirts.
Uh, if you guys don't like the name, uh
Yes, perfect, now all we need are the lyrics. You know something personal. Maybe a secret you know, or a favorite recipe, hmm?
Stop it!
The best kind of lyrics are the ones that are deep and revealing. Something only you know  Secret recipe.
It's my uh recording equipment.
Just take a seat here, and I'll strap you in.  Now just relax and let the equipment do its job. let's see what's locked in his subconscious.
Nope
The Krabby Patty Formula's gotta be in here somewhere.  What's going-  I'm a failure.
At the Krusty Krab?
When nobody's there?
Oh, no, it's the cops. I can't let them see me!
Why? Uh, cops are autograph hounds. Yeah, they're always after me.
You will never speak of this to anyone. (Scene skips to in front of the Krusty Krab.) Come on, come on, hurry up.
Give me that, you incompetent fool.  Yes, the Krabby Patty Formula is mine! Uh, I mean, we'll have a great time!  Now where does Krabs keep that formula?
Uh I'm ready?
What, no, I was in it for the music, man!
Well, at least I'm back to my old cell.
But I liked my old cell.
I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation...  ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes.  First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience.
You may win this time. She-hah-kazeek!  Well, this stinks.
Get ready Krabs,  for the surprise of your life!
Greetings, citizens of Bikini Bottom. Behold my imperial Chum Coliseum!  I vow to introduce to this fair city, culture, in the form of hand to hand grappling!  I intend to enrich your lives culturally, by exhibiting the moist spectacle of gladiators in mortal conflict!  My corporate underwriters told me to mention that it's free!  Come one! Come all! Remember, kids love gladiators.
Oh, Karen, even though you're just a frigid machine, your circuits must be welling up with emotion at my latest achievement.
This will prove to be my greatest evil scheme ever!
I can still feel the burns, which is why I removed all molten liquid from this maneuver. And it's why this time, I will be the one with all the customers. And Krabs will be the pathetic one, in an empty restaurant, stuck with a computer for a wife.  Uh, sorry, honey.
Welcome one and all, to the first bi-annual big arena of annihilation!
Brought to you by yours truly. So without further ado, let the mauling begin!
Now, release the opponent.
Enough dilly-dallying. Send out the blood sausages!
That pink dimwit doesn't stand a chance with those sausages around his throat! As soon as the smell of sausage hits that ravenous lionfish's nostrils, he'll be all over Patrick like mold on a shower curtain!
This is ridiculous! I order a simple brutal mauling for my denizens, and I get a circus act! Time for phase 2!  Chum on a stick! Get your fresh chum right here! Some chum for you miss?
Here, take this one. It's fresh and warm, like my hospitality.
Just ten dollars please.
You don't get this kind of entertainment with a Krabby Patty, do you?
Ten dollars, or the fight's off!
Here you are. I'm sure I've made a satisfied customer of you all ready.
Oh, just the usual ingredients. Some jellyfish squeezings, whale blubber, sea horse snout, and a sprinkle of anchor rust.
Now, I've been waiting for 20 years to have the amount of customers Krabs sees everyday! And I won't let that be ruined because the show's "boring", or the food's "inedible." So sit down, enjoy the show and buy some chum!
Chum on a stick. Get your chum.  What the?  Oh great! Now how am I going to entertain the masses?  Hey watch where you're...  Oh dear!  Phew. Good thing I thought ahead, with that escape door. Try and catch me now, you prissy feline!  NO! Nice kitty. Want some chum?
Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win!
Argh! I can't take it!
Yes, and after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that...that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser.
Wh-what did you say?
A customer?  Our special today is chum...  ...balaya.
Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?
What?
You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?
That naive cube! How long must I suffer this?
Elaborate.
Take the Krabby Patty?
Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.
What happens after we eat 'em?
And?
Stingers?  All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win!
What's that?
F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you-
Never! That's completely idiotic!
N is for anywhere, anytime at all!
Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?
Well, I like it. Let's do it again!
And after that we frolicked through the flowers and then we...
Well, the really fun part was when we...
The what?
You can't rush these things, you know.
What are you talking about?
What?
SpongeBuddy! Yoohoo!
Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.
Thanks for that, friend.
It's not what you think.
I... I don't see anything.
Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay? I couldn't help it!
How long what?
All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship!  And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!
No, not really. Being evil is too much fun!
What are we eating this time, Karen?
Oh, you mean the "secret recipe" I came up with?
What was me?
Is this a joke?
Uh, no.
Sorry, I really have nothing for you.
Okay, you caught me.
Yes, it is a Krabby Patty.
But, it's my version of a Krabby Patty.  After thousands of failed attempts to steal the recipe, I learned all but one ingredient needed to make Krabby Patties. The most important ingredient, the secret ingredient. Over the years, I've methodically gone through almost every letter of the alphabet. Right now I'm on the R's. And I've gotten up to raw sewage.
Try it, tell me what you think.
What is going on here?!
Same as always, look! Empty again.
I don't know anymore.
What's the point? I haven't had a customer in years!
Away with you! Can't you see that I'm self-loathing here?
What?
You're kidding right?
Uh, okay if you insist.  Oh no, please don't sue me.  I can't believe someone actually enjoys my Chum.
Did you see that? I didn't even have to threaten his life! He loved it!
Well it's simple, finally someone came in who has good taste. And he's coming back tomorrow! Excuse me Karen, but I've gotta whip up some more.  Now, I wait. I wait until he returns.  I wait. I wait. I wait. I wait.
Huh? Nat? Hello? Huh? What?  Uh, it's closing time. I should have known it was too good to be true.
Well hello, Nat.
You certainly did, didn't you?
Well, it's your lucky day, Nat. I happen to have a quite delectable one, right here.
Is it okay?
You bet 'ya.
Oh, well, you know.
What? You're coming back again?
Oh my, this is amazing! At last, I've got my revenge!
Don't bother. There's no need.
I'm just saying, I no longer need to conquer you, Krabs. I've got my own winning recipe now.
But of course loyal customer.  I'll see you later, loser. Much later!
Nat, back all ready? That's the fifth time today. Not that I'm surprised. Karen. babe, get Nat here another plate of that sweet Chum.
Say, Nat, do you have any friends?
Would you hurry up with that Chum, Karen?!
And that doesn't look like Karen.
What have you done with Karen, you brute?!
What do you think Krabs, baby? This time I caught you trying to steal my secret formula! Ironic, isn't it?
Ouch, double irony!
Good thing I sprang for the dual spoon installation.
That's right, Krabs! And you're going to have to keep looking when my customer comes in and pays me for my Chum!
Back for more of my delicious Chum, I see!
Ha-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-huh?
What's the deal, Karen?
All this time, I never had one regular customer?
I should have known! Why would anyone ever eat my slop?
What? It's just obvious that i'm a complete failure, and wasted of a lower life form! Oh, woe is me!
: Oh, Karen! I think this is it! The Chum Stick that's finally gonna drive Krabs out of business!
: Why? I haven't done anything.
:  "Plankton's Chum Made of Your Chums? The Chum Bucket serves your friends in more ways than one?"  What?!?  Who's to blame for this? Who?!?
: I lost my restaurant because of you! And I thought  was evil...
Oh, come on Karen, please!
There's nothing wrong with Chum Bucket fare. Why look! Here's a fresh batch of a delicious new chum sauce. It's called Spicy Chum Surprise.   Delectable!
Sorry, no time for your senseless chatter. I've got a customer to attend to!
We don't serve Krabby Kola, we carry Bucket Bubbler and Chum Cherry Blast.
Uggghhhh! How many times must I say it!? We don't carry Krabby Fries, we don't carry Krabby Kola, we don't carry Krabby Sauce, and we don't carry Krabby Patties!!! So if you want any of those things you're gonna have to go to the Krusty Krab which is located directly across the street!"
Any time. What is wrong with people?!
Honestly, I don't think anyone in Bikini Bottom would know a decent meal if it looked them right in the eye and said, "Hello! I'm a decent meal, wonderful to meet you! Please pay money for me and then put me in your mouth so your old pal Plankton doesn't lose everything he's spent his entire life working for!"
You know Karen, sometimes I wonder if you're here to help me run the Chum Bucket or just to make me feel like I'm two inches tall.
Oh come on! When we first met, you were little more than a jumbled mass of diodes and wires. I made you what you are today!  Literally! So don't think you couldn't be replaced in a heartbeat! Ow!
My eye is burning and I don't know why!
Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me. Now where was I!?
Oh yeah! I don't need you! I can make a whole army of computers that might actually help me steal the formula!
I'll show you woman!
Oh Karen!
Could you come here for a moment?
Feast your, uh, screen on this.
Ha ha ha, that, my dear, is a T-119A Compumatic, the finest of its kind.
Good morning T-119A.
They're supposed to do that. Next, Behold! The Noxious Enterprises Super SPU-31 Liquid-Cooled Mobile Processing Unit, a mind staggering combination of both power! And refinement.
And now Karen, the piesta  resistance.  Have you ever witnessed such marvelous machinery?
I can see how someone of your level of technical knowledge would think that Karen, but in actuality what you are looking at is... oh, right.
Okay here we go!!! Are you going to make me get the picture down again!!!???
You see! Plenty of reason to be using a hair dryer.
Because you were the one that said...
Dear Neptune!
Karen, do something! Quick! They're tearing each other apart! Just press a button or something!
Not that one!
You know Karen, with you around, I'm beginning to wonder how I'm still alive.
That's right! Now it's all clear! It's you that's been holding me back! In fact, if it weren't for your constant stifling, I'd have the whole world running for the safety of their mommies!!
Well maybe I could iron out a few bugs, but then you'll see just how much I need you!  Karen? What's this?  It's words on paper. It says: Dear Plankton, I've logged onto another network. I just can't go into sleep mode at night knowing that you'll continue blaming me for all of your failures. Anyway, you're a grown single celled organism, and allowed to make your own syntax errors. Nice knowing you, Karen. "Dah! who needs her!? Not me! I'm going to steal that Krabby Patty formula from Mr. Krabs once and for all. And then we'll see who's made the error.  Ow!  P.S., don't forget to blink. Oh yeah.
Okay team, listen up. We're on our own now so we don't have anything holding us back. Now I know you all look upon me kindly since I am your creator, but the last thing the Chum Bucket needs is, if were going to be victorious, is a bunch of soft, uh, software. Does everybody understand?
I said, does everybody understand!?!?!?
All right, then let's do this! T-119A to position!  SPU-31 to position! Command Module to position!
Heh heh heh. Now let's see Krabs stop this. I'll show him. I'll show them all!!!
Hey! Krabs, I wanna see you.
I'm here for the secret formula you twit! Now I want you to go in there and tell Krabs that if he doesn't turn over the formula to me, that he'll be subjected to utter annihilation at my... Are you getting this?
Uuhhhh, moron! Okay, I'll make it simple: Krabs give me secret formula or I bring big boom boom to the Krusty Krab. Got it?
Uhhh! Forget it!  Bring on the Boom Boom!
Hey, what gives?
Oh curse you cruel fate. Once again, you've left me covered in the sticky goo of my own folly. Only this time, I'm all alone.
Karen! You've come back to me!
Oh, I knew you couldn't stay away, I knew it!
What you gonna do, machines these days, right? Umm, listen sweetie, I'm sorry about what I said. Truth is, I could never replace you honey-bunch. Lets go home hun?
Hey, I could whip us up a little dinner, what do ya say?
Or we could go out!
Okay, Karen. Which one's better?
Oh, thanks for the help. Ya know, details like this can be very important to the customers.
Well, uh.....  ...like those customers, who just pulled up.  Well, hello, gentlemen, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Would you like seating inside or outside?
For the Chum Bucket! Where you can enjoy a nice helping of chum.  Oh, boy this is so...  ...good. The chum is.
Look, are you gonna eat or not!?!?!
Now what was I saying? Oh right . I'm tired of the Krusty Krab taking all of my buisness! We're doomed, Karen! Doomed, I tell you!
What would that be?
Advertising?  I can't believe it took me so long to come up with this
Now let's see, Q no... P no...Ah, here it is, L! There, it's perfect! CHUM IS METABOLIC FUEL!. You really did it this time ol' Planky. Oh yeah, who's a genius. Have you seen this, seen this, seen my genius, genius, genius, genius.
Hello sir, and welcome to the Chum Bucket! Er, sir?
Sir, your head, it's on fire.  THE DRINK, USE THE DRINK!
Friend? I didn't even know y-
Uh, I'm sorry
Whatever.
OK, Freakshow, you just wait. In a few minutes this sign will attract more than you can count.
Zero
Okay so it may take a little longer than a few minutes.
What the? This says "Chum is Fum." You've changed my sign to "Chum is Fum?" That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Apparently, dumb sells chum. And I believe I've just found our Advertising Director.
Next!
Excuse me, would you like a free sample?
No? How 'bout your little friend? Hi SpongeBob!
Sure you do. LOOK OUT! SHE'S GONNA BLOW!!!
Ah hehehehehehe  Chum is fum! Ah he he!
I'm gonna see how our advertising guru is doing.  What brilliant slogans have you come up with this week Patrick?
Gah! You're supposed to be coming up with witty catchphrases to keep that rabble out there happy!  Chum is Fum...We kinda got that one already.
Agh. Oh well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Keep up the good work...I guess...
HEY EVERYONE! CHUM IS FUM!
Hey Karen, check this out!
You see, every time I make a sale the sound goes there, Watch!
Karen, babe, you don't need help when you have a catchy slogan like mine.
Hmmmm....
PATRICK!
We're having a board meeting here! We need ideas!
NO! That's not it you FOOL! We need a new slogan! You need to come up with another genius catchphrase like "Chum is Fum" but different.
Here's your Chum Bucket Supreme, enjoy! Patrick my boy, you really earned that promotion!
Nothing can stop me now!
You fellas look hungry, here you go!
But you're my whole marketing department.
Check? You want money for those stupid catchphrases? Anybody can sell to my idiot customers  They're buffoons, morons, they'll buy anything I sell them. They're the dumbest of the dumb,  the stupidest of the stupid,  they're dummies, dweebs and doodoo dunderheads. I can keep that rabble right where I want 'em! Huh?
Is it too late for sorry?  D'OH!
The aroma you speak of, Karen, my computer wife, is the stench of failure!
And now the smell of defeat so deeply penetrates my soul that my very skin is permeated with its foul stench.  Thanks for asking.
Hey! What are you?
Stop that at once! You!
I command you to!
Oh no!
Although I do look ravishing, it's not enough to mask the ugliness I feel inside!
Special day?
Really? I accomplished something? What is it?
What?
Enough with the riddles, woman! Just tell me what this proud moment in my life is!
Oh, that.  Yippee.
The Krabby Patty formula!?  How did you get it!?
What??? Sorry. I wasn't listening.  Well, you can tell me later.
Wha? SpongeBob?? Ahh...there's nothing wrong. Don't worry.  I'm...fine.
Oh, it's nothing. It's just that today is my wedding anniversary.
Uh, I didn't buy Karen anything.
What? Like a kidney?
My what?
My loove?
Loop?
Lump.
L...
...uhh...
...vvv...
Llll...uhhh...vuh!
Well we like to take long walks on the beach, and, uh, we like to talk about our dreams. Our dreams of conquering all of Bikini Bottom and become supreme overlords of all creation...  ...and to trample our enemies beneath our feet.
Well, she's a Mark-2 Surplus Unevec with 256 Gigs of RAM and uh, and there's the cutest little mole on her CPU, and the way she processes data... Eh-eh oooh mama!
Uhh... well, uhh  she does make a lot of beeping sounds.
Now that you mention it she does go ding, at least once a day.
Who me? I can't sing.
Me me me me me me me... ...Me me me me me...
...me me meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  EEEEEEEEEEEEEE  EEEEEEEEE  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  EEEEEEEEEEE....
EEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whew!
Ready? But what do I sing?
Why are you so obsessed with my internal organs?
I don't think I'm ready.
No, I'm just nervous. I don't know what flying insects have to do with it.
Karen?
Oh, I have it. It's right here in my kidney... I mean, heart!  Me me me meeee...me me meee... Oh my Karen. Oh my Karen. Oh...my computer wife, Karen. Put down those punch cards. Put down those punch cards. And listen to my ode. Oh my Karen. Oh my Karen. Oh...my computer wife, Karen. What compares to. What compares to uh... uh... eee... uh... umm...  Aha! Your beautiful diodes! Oh my Karen. Oh my Karen. Oh...my computer wife, Karen. I was blinded. Yes I was blinded. I was blinded by the light of your cathode ray. Oh, I built you.  Yes, I built you. I built you in the, uh....  Um... In the shape of a cube. Oh my Karen. Oh my Karen. You'll never know how much I love your vacuum tubes
You really liked it?
I l...l...love you too!  So? Can I have my present now?
Yes! You porous kitchen utensil! By helping me woo my computer wife, you've just doomed the Krusty Krab!
Get your hand off my wife!
Oh No! You unpluged the coffee maker, SpongeBob.
Here it Comes!
That's Fantastic. Where's that formula?
Karen, what's wrong? Have you sprung a leak?
But you're shorting out.
Yes!
No!
E-M-I-L-P? What's E-M-I-L-P?!
Oh No.
It's a conspiracy, I tell you! A thousand and three times I've almost had that recipe, and a thousand and three times I've been launched by that Krabs! He celebrates eleventy-seven years of success,  I'm left with four score and forty fortnights of failure!  I give up, Karen. Krabs has won!
Oh, yeah? You try getting launched.
Ow!
Splat.
Karen?!
It's just no use!
You really think so?
Oh, Karen.
I am.
Yes, Ma'am!
Thank Neptune that's over.  Uh-oh.
SpongeBob!  Why must you always ruin my plans?
Uh, I didn't, uh... Okay fine. You caught me. You happy now?
Oh, you couldn't possibly bore me.
What? You just went in a circle. Why didn't you just stay in the Krusty Krab?
Yes? Go on.
Wait!  Wait! Hold on!
My pen is out of ink.  Okay, okay, go ahead.
There's no one here. The Krusty Krab is empty. I've won!  The Krabby formula is mine.  It took eleventy-seven years, but I got it!  Oh, no.  No!  Oh, nuts.
Hey, Krabs. uh, happy eleventy-seventh?
Please, Krabs, no! I can't take it anymore! No more launching, please?!
You know, this isn't so bad. Everyone looks like little ants from up here. Wait. Help.
Did you see that?
So, everything, that means I know where it is!
Ugh, what kind of wife...? We'll just see about that.
I knew this baby would come in handy.
Turn on the navigation system, honey! Let's get this show on the road!
Heh, heh, heh, at this rate, we'll have the formula before you can say...
Barnacles! Now what?
Well, let's just dig deeper and go around it!
Shh! Can't you see I'm concentrating?  Yes! You see what happens when you let me make my own decisions? Now, maybe we'll get somewh-   What happened?
The majesty! I've never seen such beauty.
It's just a shame no one else can see it!
Karen, please! I'm trying to process my emotions! ...Karen! I think I know how to push Krabs out of business we'll lure customers underground with this gorgeous scenery!
Man, I'm good!  Cave dwellers!  Back! That's better. From now on, you shall be my minions servants to follow my every order! I decree this kingdom to be called the Chum Caverns! And may the people of Bikini Bottom shudder in awe of its Majesty! Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Oh, I'll take that!  Eat your blackened, twisted, money-grubbing heart out, Krabs!  I'm even profiting off of your most loyal ally! I'm running out of space for this stuff! Got an empty safe I can borrow, Krabs?  But seriously, this is getting really heavy.
Another order of Chumballs!  Huh?
Krabs? What are you doing here?
Krabs, you can't just slither down here and steal all my customers! It's unethical!
Sea turtles! He called it! He always was good with legal jargon.  Alright, Krabs, if you think it's fair to undercut my business, then I'm gonna undercut you!
Heh, heh, heh! How does it feel, Krabs? Being in the hole, so to speak. Not well, I'd imagine. Now hold still so I can bury you.
Fine, Krabs, have it your way!
This is all your fault! I oughta boil and butter you for this!
Ha! There may be no way out for you, Krabs, but you needn't worry about me! My diminutive stature allows me to slip through rubble with ease.
I can't make it. We're doomed!
...Nearing the end...
You're right, Krabs. Let's bury the hatchet now and forever!
No more skulduggery of any kind.
I'm way ahead of you, Krabs!
I am, and I will!
What? We're still working together, come on! You're helping me steal your formula!
Aha! Now time to get that formula!
Oh, please. I can cause far more collateral damage than that!  Karen, where'd you put my death ray?
And eat at the Chum Bucket or perish!
All the way from the bakery. But it will all be worth it when I finally get the Krabby Patty.
Here we go...
Perfect, he's headed for the front door. Now it's time to make my exit.
Oh no! What's happening?
Eeeew!  No water! Can't breathe!
What's going on? Where am I?
What in Neptune's ocean is that repulsive thing?!
Sandy Cheeks? But where's her fur?
Wow! Wait a minute, that's it! I think I found out how to get the Krabby Patty formula once and for all!
Hope you like long showers, squirrel!
Our ticket to the Krabby Patty formula, that's what that is!
As serious as a shark attack.
Okay, Karen, wish me luck!
Heh heh. This is going to work like a charm.
Watch where you're standin', coral brains!
No, Sandy is herself. No reason to be sus-pic-ious in any way, y'all.
That was close. I gotta perfect that Texas drawl.
Uh, what are y-y'all talkin' about, SpongeBob? It's your old pal, in the livin' fur.
Please don't put your finger on it.
Lemme stop you there, SquarePants. I'd be much obliged to know how y'all make one of them there patties.
Yeah, but this is yer old buddy Sandy Cheeks.  Why, you and me are as closer 'n two catfish in a skillet.
Curse you, Krabs...!
An' approximately how long do you cook a patty?
283 seconds. I can't believe I'm getting all this straight from the source. How could this get any easier?
Yee-haw!
Oh-ho ho, man! That secret formula is as good as mine.
Okay, I'll stand on thata' side for a better view.
There it is.
That's nice. That's interestin'.
Almost there...
What, nothin'!
Aaugh! This is getting so tedious!
Gah!
try it again! I'm makin' my move!
It's finally mine! Time to kick this baby into four-paw drive!
Only from my cold, dead feelers!
My eye! This condiment is highly irritating to my eye!
Eh, that's the life.
Hey, I was watching that!
It is not! Business is just slow.
You? You're just a computer. I'm the evil genius around here.
Looks like this failure has a customer. Hello. Are you lost?
Really?
Your tour?
Groan.
You're right. I'm such a failure.
Yes.
Yes.
Right. Why didn't I think of that before?
Wow, that's a pretty good idea. Whoa! Um, Karen? Whoa!
Mmph!
And just how am I supposed to attach it to Krabs' brain?
No! Wait!
There he is!  Get out of the way! This is it!  Move it! Ha, ha! You're mine!
No!
Ugh. great.
Thanks to your brilliant aim, honey, I'm stuck inside that fool of a fry cook.
It worked! I can see everything SpongeBob sees.
Oh Boy! He's gonna make a Krabby Patty in front Of my eyes!
Heh, heh, special sauce. Wait, soap is the special sauce?
That's it! I'm going somewhere else. [plugs back SpongeBob's eye plugs]
Let me see what I can tune in here. Hmm.
Huh?
Here it comes.
Ow! I hate my life!
Enough with these petty carnal senses. If I'm going to get the Krabby Patty recipe, the brain!  Honk!  Ugh!  Hi, friend.  Superficial Greetings? What kind of idiot--  Personal Opinions? Knock-knock Jokes? No, no, no, no! This is all useless! I'm gonna have to go in deeper.  Ugh.  Where am I?
Ew. That's disgusting. Now, where do morons keep all their secrets?  Nope.  Doesn't this kid have any secrets Aha!  The library, where he keeps records of his every thought. All of his deepest, juiciest secrets.   In convenient alphabetical order. Look at that. "Sounds that make Squidward upset"?
"Patrick's favorite places to be scratched"?
Aagh, all of these secrets are lame! Wait a minute. What's this?  The secret recipe isn't in the brain? It's located in the heart. How cheesy.  Ugh. Uh.  The Krabby Patty recipe. Yes, yes, yes! Here it is!  My mouth is watering.  My taste buds are tingling. Mm, mm. oh, yeah. It feels so good. I can feel it all the way to my finger....stumps. All of the ingredients coming together in perfect harmony. And it's all mine!  Hwuh. Okay, that was weird. Like I was saying, the Krabby Patty recipe is the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab. Hwuh. What's happening to me?  It's all warm and fuzzy! It's ---  It's ---  It's beautiful!  All of the delicious ingredients living in perfect harmony.
I sure did.
Karen, wouldn't that be stealing?
The Krabby Patty recipe is the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab.
The What?
Louse what up?
Wyaagh!  What the?  This is the most bizarre precipitation I've ever slipped and fallen in.  Eeeaugh! It reeks!  But it tastes delicious!  Darn it, I almost had an idea!  Oh, I do. I do have an idea! !
Coming dear.
Next Chumstomer, please.  Well, Well, Eugene Krabs!
Sorry to disappoint, Krabs, but I've done no such thing. I'm simply using a gift somebody left me to make my chum taste good.
Sheh! It's almost like I got a personal visit from the Flavor Fairy!
Wha?
Next Chumstomer in line, please!  Hello?
Well, well, well, now I do see what Krabs meant when he said two could play that game. But he's a bigger fool than he realizes if he thinks old Plankton it gonna take this one lying down!  Uhhh... Meh
Yummy Bunz huh? Well you're gonna have to try a lot harder than that Krabs, once the hungry public hears about MY newest creation.
You're right! And it's packed with flavor!
Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?
Uh, Officer! Officer I would just like to state for the record that umm,  this was all his idea! All of it!
Well I'm taking a bath.
I can't.
I really can't come outside!
Because I'm already outside, you bumbling barnacles! Open your eyes for cryin' out loud!
Now what's this all about, anyway?
All right, so I've been stealing your mail for the past five years, big whoop.
Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle.
Forget it. Even if I wanted to the Shelly Superhighway from being built, it would be impossible.
Because the whole city has already approved it! See for yourself, through this conveniently-timed flashback.
Seems as though the ayes have it. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got superhighway preparations to be attending to. Toodles!
People of Bikini Bottom- Today marks the new- STOP MURMURING!!  Thank you. And as I was saying, today marks the beginning of a new-  SHUT UP!!!!!!  As I was saying, today marks a new beginning for Bikini Bottom!  Now, its time to pave our way down the road to success!  Ah, I love the smell of hot tar in the morning! Yeah, baby!  Hey, you there! are you trying to get yourself crushed!?
Well, then; Your wish is my command, Sponge!
Uh lower, a little lower, yeah, that's it!  Now who could that be during my hour of triumph?  How appropriate.
Oh sure!  Let me just wind my watch!
Cause I'm gonna love every minute of this!  Did you hear that?
Karen, is that you??
WAIT! I'M COMIN' WITH YOU! [before Plankton can escape, the jellyfish grab him]NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! [jellyfish sting him] NOT THE EYE,' NOT THE EYE!!!!
Good effort, SpongeFool, but you can't destroy my highway, it's indestructable!
Wait! I didn't count on all of you working together!
My highway! Stop, you can't do this!
Ha ha ha ha! Enjoy, Eugene!
You will be re-re-doing it when I'm through with you!
Another dud huh?
No need to get worked up with this Krabs, just give me the secret formula and off I go.
Well I constrict you to reconsider.
Oh well, I have other ways of getting it when I need where is the formula Krabs?
Still not going to talk 'ay' Krabs?  OK Krabs, I see you're still not going to crack but I don't think your underling is of the same metal.
Well, we'll see what Mr. Feather has to say about that.
Clever, behind the painting ay Krabs?
Say what am I smelling? you got something burning?
Bl bl blubber?
Ahhhhh! Call off your daughter Krabs! Call her off!
Stay back whale! I'm pippy to what you do to organisms like me. I've seen those documentaries!
Don't say it!
Krabs had a whale!
I hear that mocking tone in your voice Karen, and I don't appreciate it! Don't you remember what happened to my ancestors at the hands of those beasts?
That should keep her out!
Holy, protozoa!  Karen! she's here! She got in!
There's a whale in the laboratory!
See for yourself!
I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!
Karen! Karen--!
Yes, Karen. I can hear you. Could you please bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me.
Hey! Get me out of here!
Grand-Dad?
Gastric acid?  No!  I can't take it! Oh, this is driving me crazy!
What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale!  That's it. I'm done. The 4:15 bus should be here any time now.
Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?
Forget it kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.
Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!
What, do you have mud in your ears? Take a hike!
What difference does it make? There's no point ever since I've been tortured by that blasted whale.
Really?
So, you're saying that this whole time it was Krabs masquerading as a whale!?  Why that conniving bottomfeeder!
No, of course not.
No, no. Thank YOU!
Oh, is that so.
You don't scare me, Krabs.
The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!
See for yourself.  Enjoy the show!
Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, doesn't it scaredy pants? I feel wonderful!
Why?
Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here!
What?
Im kind of busy right now.
Yea, uh Id love to help, but I really got to go.  Ouch.
: Oh, Grandma, you know I always have more pudding for you!
: You once told me that this was your favorite flavor growing up as a child.
: Uh, no, chocolate. Open up!  You can let go of the spoon now, Grandma. There. Oops, looks like you've got a little on your face. Here, let me.  There you are. There you are, darling.
: Well, Grandma, that's the sweetest, most tender...
:  Now, where were we?  Grandma, don't forget your teeth.
: Ooh. Uh, uh, now, now, Grandma, just relax. There, there.  That's perfect!   Why didn't I think of this before? No one can say "No" to a helpless little grandma! Excuse me, Sonny, I'd simply love one of your Krabby what's-it's, but my delicate digestive system has special needs, and I'll need to see a complete list of ingredients. You wouldn't want me to be up all night with painful bloating, would you?
: Thanks, Sonny! I'm just going to take it home; I left my bifocals there.
:  Why, SpongeBob. Don't you recognize me?
: It's me, your dear old great-grammyma!
: I want to know all about your lifeyour job, where the secret formula is...  I mean...
: It was certainly interesting, but I'd like to hear about your more affairs, like where you work, for instance.
: Never let it be said that I didn't suffer for my occupation.
: Oh, I had the most horrible dream of my life! I was dressed up as...! Holy mother of Neptune, it's true.
: Uh, sounds delightful. Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
: Actually, SpongeBob, I said I wanted to seelife, remember?
: I want to know all about your lifeyour job, where the secret formula is...  I mean...
: Well, uh...
: Why, yes! Heh, heh, heh, heh... What I meant to say was, "More, please."
: Nope.
:
: No, I'm getting hungry. I can feel my own stomach acids eating away at my organs.
: Would I? Uh, yeah, I would. Uh, SpongeBob, would you mind terribly if we used the rear entrance? I'm a little shy around new people.
: Antenna... What?! No, I...!
:
: Never mind. Just get me into the
:
: Okay. I'll be standing right here when you get back, and not off somewhere snooping around for the secret formula or anything.
: Nothing, go ahead! Let's see how this decoy floats your boat. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
: SpongeBob, SpongeBob, up here!
: Oh! I'm all right, but I've been ground to a pulp. If only there was a nice, cool, safe place nearby, like a nearby, where I could rest and recover.
: Why he?
Oh, I feel better already.
: Sweet dreams, indeed, fool. Only this dream is about to become a nightmare, forHa, ha, ha, ha, ha...!I'm just going to savour this moment, because for once in my lifefor once in my lifeI feel
: B-But-But-But I...Grandma, I can...
: Grandma, I can explain!
Vermin? You take that back!
Owwwww!
EEEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!!
What stupid question do you want the answer to? Idiots.
The Main Drain? What are you to bothering me for? I mean I-I don't know where the Main Drain is. It's a myth anyway, it doesn't exist.
Krabs?! Why that- Well, he was just telling you a fish tail. There's no such thing as a Drain at the bottom of the sea. So go on, scram, shoe, get outta here!
Why on earth would Krabs tell those two blunderers about the Main Drain?
We were the two ding-a-lings who pulled that plug.
We just didn't want you to make the same mistake we made.
Come on, Krabs, don't you have any respect for tradition?
Ow.
This is too easy. Karen, I'm off on a business trip. Don't up wait for me, baby.
Wait! Wait for me!  Barnacles, I knew I should have sprung for a taxi! Curse you public transport! Why I oughta--  Oh, now they're on time.
Looks like it's starting to roll my way for a change. And nothing dares stand in my way!  Uh-oh.  I knew I'd make it?
Oh, come on, I just got here. I couldn't have stolen ityet.
You calling me a liar?
Oh, drat.
I told you I wasn't lying.
Oh brother.
Okay, butler, you may have hoodwinked the sponge, but I ain't no pushover!
Anyway, since you didn't steal the key, then you'd obviously submit to a search of your cabin.
Aha, that's how you stole it! Give it to me. Give me the key.
Uh, I-I mean, give SpongeBob back the key.
Me, three.
Here, maybe I can help.
Yeah, have a better look.  And thanks for the key!
Looks like you've got a lot on your mind.
Over here, choo-choo heads.
It's too easy.
Hee hee hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha.  Come to papa!  At last, my day of triumph has come! Again.
What? B-b-but how?
I can explain, Eugene. I, uh, I was just keeping it warm for you. Yeah.
Checkmate, Krabs!  Ow.
Yes! Now the Chum Bucket is the only restaurant in town!  Nuts.
Curse that Krabs and his cheering crowds! Big whoop-- a stupid time capsule.
There it is! The one element that can turn this lonesome bucket of steel into a bustling world famous eatery!
Jackpot! And now to  the secret recipe.  Careful. Careful.
Secret recipe, where are you? Aha!
Finally, the Krabby Patty secret recipe!
Quiet, Karen. Just bring me more prunes.
Okay, now what's he saying?
What? I thought you said you read lips!
Okay, now what's he saying?
A fresh batch ofooh, this is good. This is really good!
Okay, now what'd he say?
I said, "What'd he say?"
I have no idea, that's why I'm asking you what he said!
I know that! Wait... oh, he said, "What?".
Healthy and Clean, Fresh Batch of Krabby Patties? Ooh, I think I smell a plan!
Good morning sir! My name is Sheldon R. Shellcleaner, owner and operator of Super Shell Cleaner Vacations Unlimited. Can I ask you a question? Are you tire of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of...
Look I'll just cut to the chase. Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?
Of course you do! That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer. Where not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here! At Club Shell! A perfect resort for snails. Don't try to pinch yourself this could be...
...all yours! Now I know what your thinking but I got you covered!  A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge of course.
have a pleasant stay! Bon Voyage!  If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch! Then I can copy the formula, and destroy Krabs once and for all!
Wha...?
Ugh...
Curses! Oh, I mean... meow?
I've never felt better! Uh, I mean... meow!
No I'm not.
Pet hospital! But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?! I mean, meow!
Meow?
Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.
Please! No more!
Whew! I'm glad that's over.
If I could just have a...  Krabby Patty before I go...
But what?
Oh, boy...
Yes!
Yes, Spongefool come back with the formula and victory will be mine!
Uh, mommy?
Good day, sir. I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare.  Whoa, hold on there, fido!  I'm going! I'm going!
Finally! The day has come!
No! It's the day I steal the Krabby Patty secret formula from Krabs!
Because today I have completed my greatest invention. Behold!
This is no ordinary vegetable steamer, Karen, my computer wife. It's my latest invention! And isn't she a beauty. Meow.
Sweetie, you're going to help me achieve my defined purpose, aren't you? And steal the Krabby Patty recipe! Muhahahahaha!  It's ready!  Oh, boy. he says.  Whew! Man, is it hot in here.
It worked! In this new gaseous form, I will be able to silently squeeze through the cracks of the Krusty Krab. Ehahahahaha!
Hehehehe!
Finally, the moment has come!  No, No, No!  NNNOOOOO!!!
Hey! Cut it out!
Of course it's me, you moron.
Huh? Wait!
Eh? Did you say transporter?  Interesting.  Hey! Maybe if I combine this device with my own invention, the Krabby Patty formula will be mine! I mean, I think I have the right parts in my lab, eh?
Is that good?
Um... I guess.
Haha, yes.
Do you really like it?
Oh, just plug it into that doohickey over there
No, not that doohickey. THIS doohickey! Just plug your teleporter into my device, and with our combined power we shall conquer the world!
Heh. Yes, that's what I meant.
Yes, that's right. And don't let the door hit you on the way out!
What! He'll just get in the way!
A test monkey?  I've never had a test monkey before!  There is some mad scientist in you after all! Muhahahaha!  Ok, we really have to work on your evil laugh.
Rodger!  Urgh! Just a sec.
Oh, boy. Try again!
Ok. Let her rip!
Shut it down.
Shall we activate it together?
Two!
Fire!  Ow.
Yes! My plan worked! And now I have no further use for you two goody goodies!  Using your technology, I can teleport myself directly to the Krusty Krab and the Krabby Patty formula [singing in high voice] will be mine! [laughs evilly]
Fools! I played them like a 32 bit synthesizer! Muhahaha! Now where's that formula?  The formula is gone?
Hahaha! You failed! I've finally stolen a Krabby Patty!
Aren'tcha gonna try and take it back from me?
Wow, you must've snapped Krabs.  The Krabby Patty formula is finally mine!  What happened?
Aw, man (says pouting). I stole the Krabby Patty fair and square.
Hey!
Ooo... Krabs and I are bitter enemies!
Forget it, SpongeBob. Nothin' will make me friend with Eugene Krabs.  What is that delicious smell!?
No, not that. It's coming from this way.  Aha. That delectable odor is coming from that shack.  Must know more.
Another restaurant. Looks like Krabs has some real competition, huh. Interesting.
That was fantastic!  Forget the Krabby formula. I must have the Flabby Patty recipe.
Get used to it, Krabs. Your Krabby Patty is old news. Once I steal the Flabby Patty recipe your customers will be eating at the Chum Bucket.
Hey, stealin' recipes it my shtick. You haven't got a chance against me.
Bet ya don't!
Won't!
You're a loser Krabs.
Sweet Flabby Patty, here I come!
I've so got the drop on that dunderhead Krabs.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Ow! Owuhhh.
Look what that skin flint did to my antennae.
You'll be hearin' from my lawyer is what you'll be hearin'!
Stand aside, restaurant critic coming through!
I'm a restaurant critic, so I get cutsies.
I get to cut in line, so move aside. Move aside!  What is this world coming to when a fake restaurant critic can't get cutsies?
That fool Krabs, he blew it again!  Now to steal the recipe.  Aha! There it is, and it isn't even guarded.  Huh?
I did better than you, Eugene!
Yeah, I don't see that workin' out.
I agree.  This is a horrible idea.
Why am I on the bottom?
Not so fast, Krabs!  Hahahaha!
Oh, no you don't!
Yeah, you like that!
We co-op-er-a-ted.
One tablespoon listening. Two tablespoons...understanding? Mix ingredients thoroughly. Fold in warm heart. Sounds like a recipe for cannibalism.
Now, now, Krabs, SpongeBob has taught us important life lessons, such as, oh, how to fall out of an airplane for instance.
In fact, I think it's time we repay him, don't you?
We should do this more often, Krabs.
Now I'll be able to get a Krabby Patty the simplest way possible: By ordering one!  Ahem! I would like to order one Krabby Patty please! Uh, extra Secret Formula!  Hello!? Is this stupid thing on!?
Hey. Hey! Go around! Go around!
Chum Nuggets here! Going fast! Get 'em while they're cold! Get 'em while they're running! Looks like Krabs' drive thru is really paying off, for me!  Oh no...not again. .
Watch where you going old man! This is the second time!
Chum Nuggets...get them before  my arm falls off...
Zap!  I see you.  Zap!
I see you. Zap!
I see you...  Zap!  Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty.  Crush!  Lick, lick!
Here kitty, kitty, kitty.
Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot!  Yeah! Huh?  Yow!
Waaaaaah!  Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh?  No! No! No! Not the face!
SpongeBob!
Take a hike!
You don't stand a chance, Krabs! Karen and I--I mean, my worm and I, are gonna whip your tail fin!  Right, worm?
And with the prize money, I'll topple your restaurant and empire once and for all!
Alone at last! Now there's nothing between me and the secret formula! Hahahahaha!
Hehehehe!  Locked?! Ugh.[takes out cutter]Good thing I brought this along.[tries to cut safe, but the cutter slides to the ceiling with Plankton, spins 3 circles, makes two holes in ceiling, falls off, cuts off Plankton's antennae, and rolls away]I'm gonna need something with more firepower.
Hehehehe!  Yooooouch!  So the safe isn't[???]of flame, eh? It seems as though I'll have to get a little more DESTRUCTIVE!  Ahem! I meant DESTRUCTIVE!
Fire in the hole!  Rats.
Secret formula, you are mine!
Perhaps I misjudged the skill on that one.  That does it! Listen up safe, I will steal your content, even if I have to tear you apart.  Bit by bit.  Molecule by molecule.  Atom by atom!  Uh-oh.
Surely, the safe couldn't survive nuclear detonation. Come to papa!
Keep your pants on out there! I'll get your Krabby Patty just as soon as I get this bottle open.
Krabs! Why aren't you frozen under the barren tundra?
Well it would have happened if I could've dislodge this stupid cork!
Hahaha! I got it now, Krabsy.
: Uh... well I'm sure my loving wife is not a party to this angry mob. You-you've gotta help me here Karen!
Babe don't blow an on amp over this, c'mon!
Yowza! Ow! That hurt on so many levels... Okay, I give up. You win again, Krabs.
Okay Eugene. I'll just sign the surrender treaty first.  Oops, here I go. Hahahaha! Looks like I've out smarted you again aye fools?
I'd be delighted to see you try! Ooooooh, you're so close.  So long suckers!
Hehehe!
That's right Krabs and if you're thinking of busting out, mind the giant vat of fry grease beneath you.
Got any dipping sauce? A little taste of your own medicine aye crab cakes?
I better go while the going's good.
I can practically taste those Krabby Patties now!
Well I suppose dear old dad was right. I should have minored in business administration.
Morons!
He's still doing it, Karen. He's Karen?
The skinny one. He's been ranting and raving in front of the Krusty Krab for the past half-hour, waving his arms and jumping around like an animal. Oh, he stopped now. He's just broken down on the ground, crying. Karen, Karen, for the first time, it's hit me!
No, computer-brain. The skinny one may have been the gateway to the secret formula all along. As a veteran employee, he must know the secret formula, too.
Too late!
Down here! I am just an innocent passerby who felt the need to stop and tell you what a magnificent garden you have.
Yes.
You do?
Well, that's not exactly why I
I hope you don't mind me painting on your property, but the light here, it's simply transcendent this time of day.
Yes, itnot buying that one either, huh?
Hey, buddy!  Squidward!  Free cleaning service?  Census taker.  Good day, kind sir. Would you like to buy some Gil Scout cookies?  Ow!
There's nothing a little duct tape and surgical tubing can't accomplish.  Ow! I knew I should've used pipe cleaners. Hello, I'm your long-lost relative. Can I have the secret formula?
Well, that's a fine way to treat a family member.
Out of my way, SpongeBrain.
None of my tactics are making any impression on him whatsoever.
Music?
Oh, is that right?
Wait, don't irrigate me. I've come to hear your music. It soothes the place my soul would occupy if I had one.
I've never been sure of anything, but I am sure of this: play for me. Fill my ear sockets with the strains of your sweet, sweet magic.
Uh-oh. I mean, goodie.
Sweet mother of Aphrodite! Please make it end!
It's delightful!  Bravo!  Encore, encore! Yes, yes, bravo, bravo! Whoo-hoo!
Bravo!
Encore, encore, encore!
Enjoying it? Why, I'm enjoying it so much, it's making me want to... it's making me want to...
That's the word I was looking for!
Skinny arms a flappin' long nose looks real swell. Shiny head is bulging he plays really well. On the fact that he's a genius you can surely bet. This strange-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet. To hear his music playing is like, uh, music to my ears. His delightful melodies reduce grown men to tears. If you haven't heard this mollusk play you ain't hear nothing yet. This funny-looking blue guy, sure plays a neat clarinet. No one does it better. He's the best there is. When you ask him how he does it he says...
Hooray!
Say, uh, musical genius?
When you're not sharing your songs of joy and splendor, one might find you working a shift at the Krusty Krab, correct?
And you've been working there for a pretty long time, haven't you?
Well, I... I was just wondering, O incredibly musical one, what do they put in one of those Krabby Patties, anyway... secret-wise?
But... surely, you've been near the grill. You must've seen something.
You work in the same place for 20 years and you've never noticed ingredients of the sole item on your menu? Cut the comedy, octopus! I want that formula and I want it now!
What?
But then I'll never get my hands on that secret formula.  Uh-oh. My professional-grade earplugs! No!  Come back, I need you!  Stop playing this infernal pipe! You're killing me!
Aha! Okay, fish-flute, time to play a little avant-garde. Guardrail, that is.
You'll never catch me, you hear! Never!
You do? Oh.
Wait a minute, I've never seen this instrument before in my life.
No, wait! Please! Karen, help!
"A meeting of the minds to discuss the ultimate downfall of the Krusty Krab!?" This sounds too good to be true!
And diabolical conspiracies?
Salutations, puny mortals! I am the great genie of the slide carousel! WHOOOO! Endorse my vacation slides or I shall grant you three miseries!
Silence, red one! Withstand my slides!
AAAAGHHH!!
What are you, mocking me, kid? Of course everything's not okay. I can't show my slides!
Now we're cooking with blubber! My second honeymoon, it started out as any romantic getaway would. With five days of round-the-clock surveillance...
You might as well hand over that secret formula right now, 'cause once you shove off it's as good as mine! Ha ha ha! What in sea-bottoms?!
Well played, Krabs, well played indeed. But, as usual, this one-eyed creepy-crawly is one step ahead of you!  You can't beat Plan B, you can't beat it! Ah, this is going to be so sweet! Karen, we are going on a luxury cruise!
No, of course not!  Just think of it as our second honeymoon.
Why don't I bump those vacation settings up a smidge?
Yeah, it's going to be groovy, babe. Now a quick check of the vacation inventory. Suntan lotion, sunglass, death laser...
See it?! It almost split me in half!
Gotta rethink that vacation algorithm when we get back.
Nothing tops kicking back next to my loving computer wife and soaking up the rays.
Let me give you a hand with that, honey.
There he is, that swabby fool. Your turn now, Krabs.
Um, oh, the d'oeuvre guy, he's late with my nibbles again.
Is that Kelp Cheese?
Very funny, Karen. Perhaps you should of married a pile of cheese.  That's it!
Un! Eh! Un! Un! Eh!
AHHHH!
I'm so exhausted! How's it going, honey?
Yeah, heh heh, sure is.  Uh, just sit back while I massage your wheels.
Sleep well, babe, he he he he.
Whew, that was close.
AGGHHHHH!  I hate you, Krabs.
You're not getting away this time!
AGGHHHH!
I don't care anymore! Formula or no formula, I'm taking you down!
AAHHHHH!  Alright, alright! I give up! I know what I'm beat!
Ahem, good day sirs, I would like to pilfer your, I mean, purchase a Krabby Patty.
That's all? Why certainly, he he he.
From the same place this is going, the Chum Bucket laboratory! Nice doing business, Krabs! he he he he!
Ah ha ha ha ha!  Choke on that, you big..omf!
Well, technically it's your first.
Bu...but I don't think that's such a good...
35 left, 25 right, and finally, 4 left. Open says me!  Hey, what gives? I was looking right at the combination, why isn't it opening?
Trust me, you don't want to know.
No! I probably never will.
Oh Karen, if only you could see the way I do.
Maybe your right. That would explain why I stink at darts.
Karen, my dear, I think you're onto something. Looks like it's time for an upgrade!
Success! Uh oh, that ain't good. No, no, no, no no no n n n no! I can see every-
Binocular vision, here I come!  What? Oh mamma! Stop, I command you!  Oh, come on, please stop!  Next.
Karen, what am I doing wrong?
It's not love is it? Cause you know I hate that stuff.
Tears, huh? I guess if I have to.  Ow! Will these do?
2 eyes, huh? I think I know a cry baby who fits that description!
Hey SpongeBob, want to hear a sad story?
Once upon a time, there was a yellow doofus who loved to drink milk with his lunch. But unfortunately for said doofus, his milk was tragically spilled.The end.
Get a grip!
Yes, let's hurry up and get it over with!  Mommy! Here comes the pain!  That wasn't so bad. Uh oh, here we go.  Eureka!
You tell me.  Bullseye! Now for my next target  the Krabby Patty secret formula!  Hahahaha!  Wha-?  Why does everything look so weir- ... look so beautiful!
Hi, SpongeBob, great to see you, buddy!
I thought I was going to steal something. Can't imagine why. So, I'm just enjoying this lovely day!
Honey, I'm home!
Formula, what formula?  I forgot the formula! I can't imagine what got into me.
Nonsense, You're imagining things.
Hmm. Looks like a pretty butterfly!
Aww, it's a little puppy doggy!
Uhh...
A bouquet of flowers! Would you like some flowers, honey?
Ah, a few blobs of ink doesn't prove a thing. I'm as evil as ever, I'll prove it right now by stealing the Krabby Patty secret formula.
Such lovely destruction!
I'll help you! Do not worry, citizen, I'll catch you!
Oh no.
Unbelievable! I've committed another selfless act. This eye is taking over! But I must stay strong and concentrate on swiping that Krabby Patty formula.  What's this? It's the Krabby Patty formula! Krabs must have lost it.
Hey Eugene! You missing anything?
That's right Krabs. Unbelievably, I found it lying on the ground!  So I'm giving it back to you, take it.
Why didn't I run off with it? Why didn't I run off with it? Because that would be stealing!
Oh, it's this cursed new eye! I've got to get rid of it! Must become monocular again.  Hahaha, I did it!
My life of evil is over.  Hey, why is it so dark in here?
The Chum Bucket's been invaded. I'll never surrender, Never!
What, NO! NOT HUGS!!!!! It's gone. That disgustingly good eye is finally gone! I'm cured! Thank you, thank you all! Especially you, SpongeBob.
Yes, thanks to you I'm evil again, and as a token of my appreciation I'll give you all a rousing send-off with my infra-red security security attack lasers!  Oh well. Depth perception's overrated anyway.
So, what have you got for me today? Huh?  No Krabby Patty in sight.  What? What's this? Looks like a chewed-up Krabby Patty. A perfect sample from which to rebirth engineer a whole Krabby Patty!  Thanks, Eugene. You just made my job a whole lot easier.
Don't worry, Krabs! I'm just taking out the trash for ya!
Heh, heh, heh, that was almost too easy. Plankton old boy, you're home-free!
AAAHH!!!  What's with the police?! It's just a bag of garbage!  What's going on?
ACHOO!!!!  Blasted pollen allergies!  Ahh, I should be safe in space.
You gotta be kidding me!  Hello? Hello? Open up! Open up!
Wait, what?  Hey, keep your hands where I can see em'!  Ok you two, against the wall!  That's it. Nice and slow.  You gotta help me! Ever since I left the Krusty Krab, I've had all kinds of heat on me! It's so bizarre! Normally, when I steal something from the Krusty Krab, it's Krabs who chases me not a bunch of cops. So if you know what's going on, start talking or else you're gonna answer with the spoon, see!
Really?
Interesting. It appears I've won more than I bargained for.
You mean hold onto it until it's really worth something?
Turn myself in? What?! If I go down, we all go down! You're harboring an art thief!
Me, you imbecile!
Not only that, you're an accomplice to the crime, yeah.
And not only that, but Gary's an accomplice too!
No, you have! Criminal Accomplice!
Believe it, Man Boy!
Ohh, he's an accomplice too!
You may thank my new and original idea, darling.  Free samples!
Okay, so I didn't invent the concept, but I have improved upon it by removing the only obstacle to chum's success!
No. I mean getting the public to try some! Once everyone gets a taste of my delicious chum, they will tear this place apart to get some. Plus it's free, and who can resist free!  Step right up for your free samples of delicious chum!
I just said they're free!
That's the spirit, people. Step on up, but please take your time and be orderly. I wanna savor this whole putting Krabs out of business. Business.
Eat up.  I have no idea that chum was this rotten. I better not be here when all this agony turns to anger.
It's not fair! If Krabs gave away free samples he wouldn't get this treatment!
Yeah, I suppose you right, Karen.  Free Krabby Patties! Step up, step up, you'll never get this chance again, folks!
That's it.
Oh, that wasn't me that was... uh... my... brother-in-law, yeah, er, Flankton.
Krabby Patties, anyone?
I can't really believe how well this is turning out for me today.
Sweet and delicious victory, you are mine!
Don't worry, Karen, i'll be here at lunch time. My mission here is accomplished.  What the...?!
No, wait! What's going on? You hate Krabby Patties remember?  Uh-oh.
Almost done.
What's this supposed to be?
Karen, your memory banks are gumped up again. I did not request chum pot pie. I requested chum stir fry.
Computer wife, don't start with me! This plan is foolproof I tell you. FOOLPROOF!  Not only will I soon grasp the formula, but I'll get rid of your bad memory as well.
Karen, I want you to meet my new computer wife.
Karen 2!
I'm afraid so. But can you blame me? She's got triple the processing, all the latest software, and a sleek space-age design.  The whole package.
Well, I had to cut cost somewhere.
Hey, come on, babe. Don't take it so hard. You'll find love again. Maybe you'll meet a nice...uh...adding machine.
Oh, why did I program her with a jealousy scheduler.
And why did I outfit her with a molecular re-arranger ray?
Uh, uh. Let's not do something we might regret!
Huh, what happened?
Ha! Karen 2, I knew you were special the moment I laid eye on your motherboard. Goodbye Karen Classic.  Hello Karen 2.
Tonight we celebrate and tomorrow the secret formula.
Hey, what's the hold up, Karen 2? That secret formula's not going to steal itself you know.
Yes I suppose that's true. All right I got this.  What's  doing here? Karen, working at the Krusty Krab? What the?!
Wait! This isn't getting me any closer to the formula.
Ow!
Take me home, baby...
Karen! Don't you leave me, Karen. Not again.
I hope this works. Oh Karen, please wake up! I promise never to take you for granted again.
I had a reality check, that's what happened.
Come on. let's go home to the Chum Bucket, honey.
Two of you? Heh, well that is strange.
Hey.  What? You can't do that. It's not fair.
You'll pay for this, Krabs. I'm calling the Bogus Business Bureau.
Hello, yes. I have a complaint.
And I'm both of those things. You have to let me guess now,  Krabs.
This round goes to Plankton.
Hmm.  There are exactly five hundred thousand...  Three hundred...
...And one.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yes!
You heard him, Krabs. Give me a Krabby Patty.
What?
What show?
Oh, come on. Are you kidding me?
Drat.
Is this part of  "the show?"
Ugh.
Okay, we get it already.
Oh, bravo. Bravo. Why does the puppet get to eat a Krabby Patty and I don't? And why aren't you in the kitchen cooking my patty?
Finally. At long last, the Krabby Patty is mine. Go ahead and wrap that up, son. I'll take it to go.
Yeah, that's what it says.
Okay, okay. I will.  I bid you good day, sir.
Oh, come on.
Fine.  Can I go now?
Karen, quick. You gotta cut this Krabby Patty out of me, stat.
There's no time. I can feel it digesting.
Keep it moving, nice and orderly. Hey, Eugene, want a free Krabby Patty? Just guess how many customers I can fit into the Chum Bucket.
Wait, come back. Oh, come on, Karen. What happened?
Oh, Santa, Santa, Santa has his eye on me. He's seen everything I've done. Every plot, plan, and scheme. It's just a bit of fun. Santa has his eye on me. Every naughty deed is written in his scroll. So every Christmas morning, I get a stocking full of coal!
I'm way ahead of you, Karen!  There is one element in the known universe that can turn even the nicest sap into the biggest jerk they can be! And I, Plankton have discovered it. Behold! Jerktonium! I'll give everyone in Bikini Bottom a present of the most innocent of all goodies. The fruitcake! Each and every slice will be laced with Jerktonium! Once ingested, no one can help becoming the biggest, creepiest, meanest jerk ever! Then Santa will realize that Sheldon J. Plankton isn't so bad after all! And then I'll get what I  want for Christmas, the Krabby Patty secret formula!  And now for the main ingredient, JERKTONIUM! Okay, Jerktonium, do your stuff! It's complete! Ha ha! The Jerkmaker 9000 will make doling, outraging fruitcake a breeze! Now, who's gonna be my first victim?
Sure thing, fruitcake! Here you go!
Hot from the oven and full in lovin'!
So, how do you feel, kinda cranky?
Sorta surley?
Maybe just a little bit jerky?
Hmm... He must have gotten a piece without Jerktonium! Here. Have some more.
How's your dander? Is it up?
Grrr! Have some more!  Have a baker's dozen!  Well?
You know what? Knock yourself out.  Stupid hunk of-tonium! My gift to Bikini Bottom. Boy, oh, boy.
What's all the racket? What do you know? The Jerktonium seems to work on these jerks. Very interesting.
This just keeps getting better and better.
Success! Soon all the Bikini Bottomites will be jerks! Now I just need to figure out what to do about old SpongeBoy.
Drat! That square-head's gonna throw my whole naughty to nice curve right off! I guess it's time to introduce Plan B.  Hahahahaha! Plan B, meet Karen. Now go, my automated agent of naughtiness, go and destroy SpongeBob's good name!  Huh? Oh yeah.
Oh, SpongeBob, you've been a bad, bad toy!
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Frica-what?
Well, the smell doesn't make me wretch...  Hey, that ain't bad at all!  It's actually amazing!  This is gold in the form of chum! Squidward, my friend, you'll be the toast of Bikini Bottom! This recipe is going to make you a star.
Yeah, see how you like it, Krabs!
Yeah, what's up?
What's the hold-up? You said it took exactly 24 hours.
But I haven't even sauteed it yet. Whatever you say.
Thank you, sir. Come again. Enjoy your leftovers.
What?! Oh, you're not pinning this on me! You said you didn't care if it was ready or not!
Not the napkins!!! ()
My restaurant!
Boy, I don't know what it is, but I feel like there's something in the air! Today is the day I finally get a Krabby Patty!
This looks suspicious.
99 feet!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!  OOF!
You are moving!!
Oh no I'm not!
You might as well close up shop right now Krabs. Your customers won't miss a thing
Oh yeah!? WellI'm gonna put together a....uh...a petition of customers signatures.
That does it!
My restaurant. My laboratory. My evil inventions. All about to be flattened! Just give me a moment to say my goodbyes.  Farewell, stench-vision goggles. Farewell, Chum Bucket replicator. Farewell, hypnotizer helmet. We had some diabolical times together, didn't we?  So long, sonic cannon that destroys every known material in the universe.
Hey, get lost! I'm the only one that weeps around here.
Karen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Not to worry, my lady. I have a plan.
You just got a steel, sir. You'll get many villainous years out of that little number.  I'll forget this restaurant nonsense, Karen. I should've opened a yard sale business years ago.  Step up, fishes. Every evil invention is price to move!
How much you got?
All right. My wife's not for sale.  But everything else must go!  Well, wifey. Looks like it's time to proceed to the next phase.   Who wants free money?
['Everyone crowds around him.][holding a dollar][holding a piece of paper attached to a clipboard]
Thank you, thank you! I've got what I need!  I got the signatures!  All but one. Guess I won't be hiring the yellow sponge anytime soon.  But none of that matters now! Cause the majority is on my side! Which in a democracy is all you need.
Oh, not me, your bureaucraticness. I completed my petition.
Bring it on! Bring the destruction!
What?! Excuse me, sir, but, uh...  you forgot to level the place!
But that's not fair! .]
Come on! Let's do this! I wanna see some destruction!  I think I've seen enough.
Gasp!  Hopping Hamburger Stands! I gotta go home and get my wallet!
Hello sir! I'd like to purchase the Krusty Krab restaurant you have in your...where is it?
You want what?
Look, I know I'm an evil heartless mastermind, but no one can ingest raw chum and survive!
Really?
Well, it's your funeral.
Heh! Heh! Finally! I have a fool-proof plan to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula! Krabs will never recognize me wearing......these glasses!  What in the seahorse is going on around here!?
Pests!? What are you talking about?  AN URCHIN!!!  I HATE those things! This won't do at all. I can't steal the Secret Formula with that varmint running around!  I propose a truce Krabs: I'll help you get rid of that creature and I'll promise not to steal the Secret Formula until it's gone. Crook's honor.
Don't worry.  Karen?  No I don't have it. Why do you even bother asking!?  Yeah, yeah...Look! Send over my killer-death robot would you?  No, the other one.  I love you too snookums...Help's on it's way!  Behold! Your champion!
Hold on! You haven't seen it in action yet!  I'll just set it for our query.  No... Ignore that one... Ah ha! Bingo! You have your orders, ATTACK!
Ok. Maybe the Death Robot wasn't the best idea...
I'm not sure I like where this is heading...
Oh, come on! There's gotta be a better way!
Oh brother...
I'm only helping you out so I can get back to robbing you blind!
This getup is one hundred percent humiliating. Here urchin, urchin, urchin!  Here you dirty filth-spreading porcupine. I'm wearing lipstick here. Come on, let's go!  Huh? What was that? Look sharp Planktonella. I think we're being watched  Ah!  Uh...hello?
Fine  H-h-hey there handsome! You're cute!...for a parasite. Woah there, buddy! Why don't we start with a nice romantic stroll? Outside, far away from the Krusty Krab! And the Secret Formula... Ok! OUCH!  Hey! What kind of an urchin do you think I am!?   What could be worse than being romantically pursued by a ravage sea urchin!?  A HUNDRED URCHINS!!!
Come on! Let me out!  MOMMY!!!  Come on! Open up!  HELP!!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah! Keep your shirt on!
SpongeBob?! What in the sea shell are you doing here?!
Excuse me. Doesn't this count as "cruel and unusual punishment"?
Do you mind?
So honey? Is "you know what" inside?
No! Uh, no. The "secret ingredient."
I mean the file?
Karen, you got to get me out of here!
Phew...
I'm not even sure what "that" is...
Wait a second! I didn't say you could-
Hey! I need that! For my bones!
Wait! Put me down!Uh oh... You can't eat me! I'm Bikini Bottom's most evil genius!
I say I'm Plankton blast it!
Hey! I'm in here! I'm Plankton!
Are we at the airport? Ahem! HEY! Gather 'round fellow convicts! It is I: the one and only Sheldon J. Plankton, evil genius!
Now let me get this straight, you low-lives respect me?
With this pack of criminals, I can steal the Secret Formula like that!
Ok gang! We need to bust out of this joint! Any thoughts?
Yeah, I can see why you're still in jail. THINK, people! We need a plan!
Yeah! Good old chum. Say what now?
Chum? What use is chum?
You ever tried eating it?
But have you tried it on a bun?
Really? Maybe I overlooked chum's hidden potential! Fellow ne'r-do-wells: If its chum you want its chum you shall have! Luckily, I happen to know the recipe! IT'S TIME FOR A JAILBREAK!!!
Listen up reprobates! Chum requires specialized ingredients of the highest quality!
Hmm...you there! Sniff this sock! Yes...let us begin! Cultured fungus growth medium!
Subtropical, vegetal matter!
Organic filler.
Hey you! Blow.Live bacterial culture.Now, to secure the containment vessel. Agitate primarily compound! And quality inspection! Ok boys! I think it's time we evacuated this institution!
Sigh. IT'S TIME TO BREAK OUT OF PRISON, YOU DOPES!!!
Chum! Detonator! Is this detonator made out of soap?
Launch me!
Uh oh... It worked!
What in the name of electrolysis!?
Oh my! That is a dilly of a pickle! Oh well, if you cannot escape through the back wall, I guess we have to leave through the front door! Quickly my fellow felonons! FOLLOW ME TO THE KRUSTY KRAB!!!
I gave you your freedom, now bring me the Krabby Patty Formula!
Yes! With my new gang of vicious convicts, you're no match for me now Krabs! Fellow jailbirds, bring me the Krabby Patty formula!
Did you tried looking in the safe?
EUREKA!
Sorry Krabs! Nothing can stop me now!
What's happening!?
Hey! Watch where you're pointing that thing buster!
Infiltration achieved. Phase one, complete.  Now for phase two.  Sabotage!
Wow, phase two is great! My favorite phase so far.
Just like clockwork. The twerp approaches. Time for phase three.
Oh, just picking up one of these.  Not that you'd know what it is.
Wow! A fellow spatula enthusiast, I see. You're right, SpongeBob. But with a few modifications, it'll serve as the end-cap for my SizzleMaster.
Well, there is only one. And some say it has magical grilling powers.
Well, you could come over and check it out.
SpongeBob, it's a magical spatula with a legend. This is a one-in-a-lifetime experience.  Onward to the Chum Bucket!  Hey it's this way, kid.
Feast your absorbent eyes on this!
These are nothing compared to......the majestic SizzleMaster!
Yes, SpongeBob. I believe the SizzleMaster has found its fry cook in you! The legend of the SizzleMaster has been fulfilled.  And since your are its fry cook, it will reduce your workload tenfold!
Yes, a legend has been fulfilled today. Go forth, SpongeBob. Wouldn't want you to miss the lunch rush.  Or as I like to call it, "Phase 4."
Enough, my sarcastic wife. Enough to gain SpongeBob's trust, then steal the Krabby Patty formula right from under his dumb yellow nose!  Now to tune in SpongeBoob.
That's right, SpongeBob! Let's show this lunch rush what for!
Well I can! The mystical SizzleMaster can do all!
You know, SpongeBob, there's a much faster way to do this.
Hey Sponge, I know a way to double our productivity. I'll handle things here at the grill, alone, while you man the condiments, huh?
Drat!
Leave it to me, kid.
It sure was, SpongeBob. And maybe tomorrow I can even handle the grill for you, huh?
Dang it! I need SpongeBob to trust me behind that grill for this plan to work. Hmm. Oh! Hey SpongeBob!
How about you take me back to your place tonight? I mean, I could help you around the house.
Oh, I am so much more than a patty flipper.
Sure!
It's not like it's actually me touching it, so...
Infiltration complete. Time to execute phase five!
Karen! I thought I told you not to put smell sensors on the spatula!
That's no problem, buddy.  Hey, why don't you take a seat while I get to work for you?
Would you like me to man the grill for you today?
You deserve a break. And I've been able to handle everything else for you, so...
Yes! Phase five is finally complete! Time to kick phase six into overdrive!  Yes, burn patties, burn!
Oh, SpongeBob, I'm sorry. I just wasn't used to this grill. All of the Krabby Patties are gone.
Hey, I got an idea!  I can mix up some new patties in a jiff. If we just go get the Krabby Patty secret formula.
Yes! Ye-e-es.
Yes! Karen, begin production!
Y-y-yes!  Wait how much disulfide?
I had no idea this stuff was approved for restaurant use.
Krabs?  Oh, no.
Oh, hardy-har-har!
Chum! Get your red, hot chum here! What's the deal? According to my algorithm,  beach-goers should be famished  and looking for a treat. A treat like chum! Hello? It's perfectly edible, people!  Oh, come on, man! This is my livelihood!
I could think of a few.
Ah, sweet karma. It can come from the most boneheaded of places.  Wait a second. What are those bouncing blobs of goo?
Dangerous?
That rodent's right. A giant goo bubble could really level the playing field. If someone were able to control its power, they'd control all of Bikini Bottom. And I'm going to be that someone.
I can't find this thing anywhere.  Come on, now. Think, Plankton.  If you were a giant bubble of dangerous goo, where would you be?
That's great, sweetheart.
All right, Karen. I'll make sure I write that down in my book, titled,
What did you say?
That's it, Karen! The goo bubble must be stuck at the bottom. We just have to get down there. Karen, cut the power to the entire ship.  Yes!  Look, there it is! Karen, fire up the engine power.  With my mechanical clam digger, I'll crack open this goo-cano easy as a clam! Which is what it was built for, so... You know, that makes sense.  Yes! Yes! Bubble forth, my gooey wrath!  And now to get the ding-dang out of here!
Yeah, it's me.
Well, that's for me to know and for you to clam up!
Let's just say I've got big plans for this little bubble.  Now, if you'll excuse me I have to go.
Ha! They'll never catch me at this rate!
That's right, come to Papa.
Oh, dear, I guess you've got me. Oh, wait a second--  No, you don't!
Aw, don't go so soon.  I hope you brought your dancing shoes!  'Cause it's time to do the electric goo-boogaloo!
Hello, down there, Krabs! Look, I brought you a pretty balloon! And in return, you can give me the Krabby Patty secret formula!
Cause if you don't,  I'm gonna pop this disgusting thing and destroy Bikini Bottom!  As you can see, I projected the blast radius of this goo-bomic balloon and it's gonna cover pretty much everything in town.
Oh, yeah? Well, look again, you dingus!
You heard him, Bikini Bottom! It's time to kiss clean goodbye!
Eh, not again.
Well, this is interesting. Let's see where it goes.
Uh-oh.
Okay, where were we? Oh, yeah!
That's it, no more messing around! Give me that formula or I'll destroy this stinkin' town!
I can't believe it! After all these years, it's mine!  I'm so happy, I could just burst! This bubble that is!
Now to see what's inside a Krabby Patty! "Just one ingredient:..."  Darn it, Krabs!  Ow.
A company picnic, eh? That gives me an idea.
Guess who?
Uh, what do you mean? I'm having my company picnic. This is our spot.
Come now. Can't we all just share? Nothing should spoil this perfect day.
Sure I do.
Those are my new hired, Simmy and Tally. Just look at them tossing the disk around.
You're all welcome to join us of course. There's plenty of fun for all.
Oh, just setting up the rest of the activities.
The cotton candy machine, hot roasted peanuts, games of chance, bottles you can knock over to win a prize, the world's most exciting roller coaster, a deep fryer for delicacies...
And of course, the dunking booth!
Have you seen the calliope?
You were saying, Krabs?
Say no more, my friend.  If you'd care to work for me, just sign this contract with this delicious candied pen.
Oh, don't bother to read it. Not on such a fun day.
This is working far better than I planned! With Krabs as my employee, I can order him to give me the Krabby Patty formula and the Krusty Krab will be no more!
Uh oh.
Unbelievable!
Uh oh.
Attention, beach-goers! You are trespassing! You have exactly seventeen minutes to haul your carcasses off the future site of the  'Chum Bucket Mega Bucket.'
Okay, have it your way. I don't mind bulldozing over each and every one... hey! Put me down!
You'll see.  You'll all see! The future site of the Chum Bucket Mega Bucket must be clear to these cretinous beachgoers. But it's becoming increasingly obvious. I can deny it no longer!  I am small. I need someone big to clear the beach for me. I need...  SpongeBob!
Yes. He's the one.
Oh, hi, SpongeBob.  I'm cryin' because I've got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one!  I don't know what to do with the other one!
SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?
SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  SPONGEBOB!
Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance.  You can have anything you want with a little training.
Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.
That's right.
Wonderful.  SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!
No, no, be assertive!
Not in-sertive!  SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!
Don't say it!  There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?
Listen, you! My friend's got something to say!
Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!
Great! Now let him have it!
No!  I'll show ya how! Hey, pencil neck!  Yeah, you, slither over here!  Surrender that ice cream cone or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery!
Those were tears of joy I told you! He was happy that you were assertive!
You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?
Whatever.
SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!
Now look what you've done! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!
SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!
Oh, nothing, SpongeBob.  I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.
Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.
What?
SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!
Okay, but this is your last chance!  Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?
Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach!  SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?
Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!
SpongeBob that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!
Breaking your wind!
Exactly.
Oops.
Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world!
Huh? What are you doing?  Wait, SpongeBob! Stop!  Butterfly kisses. Can't take it. It's too cute! It's... it's disgusting!
SpongeBob, stop! Before it's too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back!  Wait!
Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting!  Need hatred.
Why couldn't I see it before?  The way to get the Krabby Patty formula was so obvious!  Spend an inordinate amount of time training several dozen sea bears to take over your restaurant and force you to give it up!  can turn them from their central purpose!
No...  My weapons!  Ouch!
No! Come back!
Heh-heh-heh...
Er, money's not everything, you know.
Well, if you love money so much,  why don't you  it?
you now...?
Yuhh!  This gives me an idea.  Owww!
...scam you out of your secret formula, that is. Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!
...just as I planned.
Ugh. Well, I finally did it I kissed a crab!
Uhhhh... Teen Talk, Teen Talk...  Ah. Girls like shoes.
Eeeeeeee...
Perfect!  When we're married, he'll  to tell me the secret formula!  Yeah!
Ugh... Uhh... Uhh! Who knew Eugene was so light on his crab legs?
Oh boy, here it comes!
(Girl voice) Come on, Krabs  Let it all out!
No, no, I'm not Plankton  I'm Cashina, you're blushing bride. I.. uh... uh... Am I blushing?
You're not gonna crush me?
Get a hold of yourself, Krabs.
You're crazy! I'm out of here, and one day, the formula will be mine! Mark it.
More fruit punch, SpongeBob?
Oh I love office parties. We got roller chair races and karaoke. Hey! I know a gag we can do. Copy our faces on the new copy machine!
Why don't you lay your whole body down? That glass is big enough.
Just lay face-down and keep still.
Alright. Party's over. Go home!
No more punch for you! You don't look so good, SpongeBob. I suggest you take the day off tomorrow.
Are you sure?
You'll be fine if you take tomorrow off.  Hello, SpongeBob CopyPants. Can you say "Secret formula"?
"Se-cret Form-ula"
Now, remember. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and your assignment is to ask Krabs for the secret Krabby Patty formula.
Excellent! Now, off you go! Wait!  Just keeping track of my copy.
What are you doing here!? You said you would take today off.
Are you sure? Because you're sweating. []
But you can't work. You have yellow jaundice!
Hey, SpongeCopy. Good to see ya.  Have you learned the secret formula yet?
Me Two? I'm such a deep sea dope! Now that the copy's gone in contact with the original SpongeBob, he won't tell me the formula.  Time to adjust my plan.
[] Karen, did you know you're married to a genius?
Now where was I? Oh yeah, I saved SpongeBob digital DNA. []
Yuck! Now listen. Your name is SpongeBob SquarePants and you're to go straight to Mr. Krabs  and ask him for the secret formula.
And stay away from any other SpongeBobs!
You see, this is why I never had children.
He's doing it. He knows the formula. I can taste triumph! Wait, No! No!
Neptune's puddle! Now that SpongeBob's been corrupted by the other 2! What I need is a legion of Bobs. A full-lined blitz cream of Bobs. [] March! March my pretties and learn the formula!
They all know the formula!
I'm gonna know the formula! I'm gonna know the formul...
Uh, well, that's pattonly ridiculous!
I was afraid of that. I thought I'd save some money by using cheap toner.
It means my plan is ruined! All the SpongeBob copies will fade away now!
Quickly man! Before you fade, what's the formula?!
Wait no! [] []
What's the formula?! []
Geez, What a cheapskate. I can't believe I failed again!
Wait, are you a copy?! Quick! What's the formula?!
You wouldn't want all those copies of you around. They were just imitations anyway.
One SpongeBob is more than the world can handle anyway. You're a unique snowflake.
Yeah, you're pretty annoying. Well, you can stomp on me now if that's you want.
Well, what do you know about that. No comeuppance!
Eh, spoke too soon. Comeuppance in three. two... [] OW! Right on my keys!
Fortune cookies at the Krusty Krab, aye? Well, Eugene, I have a prediction too. You are in for an epic fail supreme with extra cheese!
Barnacles, woman, would it kill you to leave me alone for five minutes!
Riddle me this, computer wife, what's hollow, full of lies, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth?
No! Fortune cookies. And Krabs is raking it in right now because all of his fortunes are actually coming true?! So...
Wow, I can't tell if you're sarcastic or psychic.
This will be a good one, "You stink."
Enjoy your new fortune cookies, Krabs!
Let the wave of misfortune begin.
Hello! Did someone say copepod?
Just wanted to borrow a cup of grease Eugene. I'll come back later, ciao!
The scheme is working perfectly, and here comes gullible Krabs now to hand-deliver the secret formula. I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
Don't worry secret formula, I'm comin' baby!
Finally!  No!  Ah-hah.  I have had enough! Get out of my restaurant you mindless sheep! I wrote those fortunes,  they were fakes, don't you get it?! Now all of you out!
I guess I didn't really think that through.
Oh yeah?! What are you going to do about it Eugene?
"You will go on a long voyage where you will get everything you deserve."  Hey!
Hey! Mommy!
Finally, now is my chance to strike.
Pfft, never happened.
Now to make my escape.
Aren't you gonna try and stop me?
What do you mean, $1.99? You're not gonna step on me? I've got the secret formula, you know.
Eh, forget it. What's the world coming to?  All right, just give me one Frozen Krabby Patty to go.
Yes, you fools!
I'm ready, I'm ready! Ready to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula! Prepare to initiate plan number... hmmm... number. What's the number? Oh well. Who cares?
Say what?
That formula will be mine!
Out of my way, pinheads! Move it, move it, move it!  Hey there, snazola! I'm about to show you the advantage of not having a nose. Say hello to... Mr. Stinky!
That's right, everyone. Gather in real close.  Time to trigger the stench!  Yoink!
I hope you like percussion, Eugene. Because these drumsticks really go bongo!
What? The old safe in the safe routine?
I'm not hungry!
Oh, you're right, Professor Krabface! I'm much too simple-minded to look there!
Hey, there.
Pleasant night, eh SpongeBob?
Ain't that the truth? Hey, nothing gets past you. One could say you have the formula for honesty.
Yeah. Gotta keep that hair clean and in a safe place.
Why, hey there, little fella!  Is SpongeBob..  I mean your master at home?  Eh, perhaps I could just come inside for a minute and demonstrate our fine snail products.
Shell polish, slime deodorant, chew toys...
My leg!
Your friends won't tell ya this, but you can really use the slime deodorant, Smelly!
Hello, sir...  Hello, sir! I'm selling Sweetie Patrol cookies! We have a lovely assortment of fungi and algae flavors.
How many delicious boxes can I put you down for? If you order ten boxes, I'll qualify for my bottom-dweller badge. If you order a hundred boxes, I'll get my bling-bling badge. You know, you should hide these from your roommate. She'll eat all of them.  If you show me your best hiding place, I'd be happy to help.
Note to self: Nitroglycerin is not a substitute for vanilla extract.
I forgot how much I hate pineapple.
Hey, this snail litter tastes better than pineapple.  Now, where is that secret formula?
Where is it? Where is it? Gotta be here somewhere.
Nothin' in there.  Ooh, look at that.
Hello!
Where the barnacles is it?
Where is it? Where is it? I know you're in here! You're not foolin' anybody! I went to college!
Nope, nope, nope.
Alright, Snail! Let's go! Just you and me!
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Of course! What a fool I've been!
SpongeBob's hidden the secret formula inside Gary's shell! Sheesh! This place is disgusting! I bet it reeks. Good thing I don't have a nose. Huh?  Aye yae yae!
Ha! I lost him! Now, I'm lost!
Ah, my head. Oh, I must be in the center of the shell.  What's that?  This is it! Just like I thought! It was hidden here all the time! The secret Krabby Patty formula! It's beautiful!
The heavenly light! I always knew I'd see it once I've gotten the formula! Let me bask in its glory!
Ha, ha! I got it! I got it!
I've finally got the formula! It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine! Open the sparkling apple juice, Karen! Daddy's bringing the bacon home! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!
I don't get it. A crab's brain is smaller than the point of a pencil, but he keeps outsmarting me!
Yes.  Yes he would! As dumb as Patrick!
One swab from the inside of his cheek should do it.
Nagging Neptune!  Back you twisted tongue! You will not lick me!
Sweet gashes molasses!
I told you to turn off that laugh track. And if you must know, I made sauce.  But when I add Patrick's DNA to it, it'll become Salsa Imbecilicus.
Idiot sauce!  I'll serve it to Krabs and it'll make him so dumb, he'll just give me the secret formula! Huh? Huh?
Leave me be woman!
Oh no.
You not Plankton! Me Plankton!
Yeah!
Shut up, dweeb!
Cook books, eh? You holdin' out on me, Krabs?
I know you're cookin' up something special in Home EC, Eugene! I want that formula!
Did you finish my homework for me, nerd?
I'll never learn!
Not again!
Somethin' smells good!
It's the last day of school, baby. No need to be formal. Call me Sheldon.  Great Neptune! That's perfection! Well, with this recipe, I could own the most popular fast food restaurant in Bikini Bottom!
Hand over that secret formula, Krabs!
What?! If I knew education worked like that, I would have bought a diploma years ago!
But... but you were just about to give me the formula! Y..You were scared of me!
Wait, what?! Acting class?!  No!!
Rook to king four.
Check-mate.
It was okay. He got my face right, but that voice is terrible.
Why don't we just destroy him and get it over with?
Hey!
What a great idea.  Ugh!
I forgot the secret Krabby Patty formula, Mr. K. Would you remind me again?
Thanks.
Hey, SpongeBo Whoa! I see you've got yourself a little problem with the cooties.
Lost your job you say? I might be able to help you, if you can do something for me.
Ridding SpongeBob of his worms will put him forever in my debt. That secret formula is good as mine!
Time to crash this lousy party. Get it? Lousy? Louse? Oh, I'm good.
You're on your own, worm boy.
What? What is it, Karen? Can't you see I'm working there!
Great.
Ehh...  No, I didn't! Can't you see I'm working on my new molecular analyzer?  Now all I need is the smallest molecule of a patty and the formula will be mine!
I said not now  oww-oww!
No one asked you!  Are you happy now, Karen?
Stupid? Your new screensaver is stupid and it makes your processor look fat!
Oop! Okay, let's all calm down before you say something you'll regret!
I will not get out! This is my restaurant and no one can make me...  leave!!  Ow! Karen, baby. Come on, sugar lips, you know I'm sorry for everything I said.
I wasn't taking to you, idiot!  Pain!  Okay, Karen, fun is fun, but it's time to let me back in. Come on, I really need to use the potty!
Fine, I don't need you or the Chum Bucket! I got plenty of friends around here who would love to take me in!
So is it cool if I crash here?
Then can I just use your bathroom?
Are you crazy? You're the most annoying sponge in the sea. I wouldn't stay with you if you were the last person in Bikini Bottom.
Okay, fine!
Whew! Much better. Thanks for letting me use your bathroom.
Well, in that case, you're gonna need some new shoes.
Yes!
Oh, forget this!
Threw me out? I threw her in!
Hey! What? Get off! GetOh!  Oh, that's the spot.
I don't know, I was just doing the same things I always do.
But I'm the best.
Me, aggressive?! How dare you?!  Maybe you're right. I can be a big jerk sometimes. I command you to help me be a nicer person!  I mean, will you please, please help me be a nicer person so Karen will take me back?
What is that dimwit doing here?
Will you stop that?! There's no one behind you! You're the dimwit.
Fine, but if he kisses me, I'm gonna lose it.  Ugh. After you.
Whoa!
After you.
How dare you reject my act of kindness! Yah!
Easy!
Uh...Patrick, you're not a total moron. Just half of one.
Fine. Your color pink is not so repugnant.
What? What's wrong with my antennas?!
Yeah, right! You two are mocking me!
It's no use, SpongeBob. I'm just too brilliant to be nice! I'll never get Karen back now.
Brother.
Forget it, SpongeBob. Karen's the perfect woman: so smart, so conniving! Ah, she's never gonna take me back.
That's a great idea! I'll cook up a scheme to make her jealous and crush her spirit!
Sure it was. And I know just how to do it.
Of course I'm sure! Now, start doing a robot voice. Remember, you're not SpongeBob anymore; you're Shelby Naughtica.
Yes, hello. I would like your most romantic table for myself and my beautiful date, Shelby Naughtica, the robot.
This is going so great, SpongeBob! Karen is totally jealous!
Don't you ruin this for me, SpongeBoob. Just eat it!
Ugh.  Oh, my dear, Shelby Naughtica, you are the most beautiful woman I've ever laid my eye on.
I never knew what love was until I met you.
1,000 what?!
No! The whole point of this scheme was for me to get Karen back, and now you're ruining it!
Of course I did.  I'd do anything for you, baby, even hang out with this moron.
Eww, it's that fat screensaver again.
Now, Karen, take it easy!
Down here, idiot! I want to strike fear in the hearts of other drivers. You got something terrifying in that wand for me, SpongeBob?
Oof!
Ha-ha-ha, you fool! Now I will rule the streets!
Ouch!
Strike fear...
Whoa, big fella!
Actually, yes, that is true. I've got it all worked out.  First I break into the safe, and...  Huh? Wait, is this live?
Don't broadcast my secret plans! They're secret!  I will destroy all of you!
Secret formula, ho!
I reckon that classified taste mixture will be in my hands directly.
Ow!  The fool! He left the safe open!
Open for business, baby!
Urrgh!
Ha, that fool!
And the Krabby Patty is made of...
Urchins!
Yoink!
Yes!
Whee!  Come to daddy, patty!
Oh, Karen, he covered me in urchins, fed me to a seahorse, and stung me to death! I fly through the air, he flies through the air! I hide in a stomach, he hides in a stomach! I have had enough!
No, Karen! That's just not gonna work anymore! Don't you see? We're done here.
A new life in a new town!
I'd like a room, please.
Forever.
And so begins my retirement!
Yes!  Yes!
Yes! My plan is almost complete!
Oh, my pretty. You'll be my best friend from now on.  Retirement is mine! Mine! Mine!
Krabs?! What are you doing in my hotel room?!
Oh, I know you won't, Krabs, because I'm at the Krusty Krab right now stealing that formula.
Because I'm a decoy look-alike robot!
That's right, Karen. By the time those two knuckleheads figure it out, I'll be knee-deep in secret formula.  Yes, I'll wear my galoshes. Gotta go.
In your face, Krabs! Ha!
Krabs? SpongeBoob? W-w-why aren't you in Dullsville?
Hate! Hate!  Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!
So you're the real Krabs and SpongeBob.  Gimme that!
I, Plankton, with my superior intellect,  devised a plan to crush the Krusty Krab once and for all! If people won't come to the Chum Bucket, I will bring the Chum Bucket to the people! Behold! The receptacle of your doom, Mr. Krabs! Wait, this isn't-  Mommy!
Ahhhhh!
(singing to real tune) O come, all ye fearful, cower as I crush you!
(dancing and singing to real tune) I'll rule the world, and everyone; you will bow down to me!
(dancing, holding a microphone and singing to real tune) Deck the hall with fists of fury (punching at screen) Ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha. (wipes sweat off and hangs tongue)
(singing and marching to notes) De de de de de de de de, de de de de de de de de, de de de de de de-
Season's beatings, underlings!
My evil genius video diary, by Sheldon J. Plankton.
Is this thing... Hello?... Can't get it to... Greetings! It is I, Plankton! Boy, I'll tell you, Karen is really working my last nerve right now.
I don't know anymore!  It seems like all she does lately is nag, nag, nag, nag!
It's like I can't do anything right! She doesn't support me in any of my evil plans.
And does she ever help me steal the secret formula?
Nooo! Well I have to admit there something about her. When I look into her screen, it's like I am falling in love all over again. What can I say Karen, baby I am crazy about ya'!
Derrgg... Karen! You haven't heard the last of me!
My evil genius video diary, by Sheldon J. Plankton.
Greetings, it is I, Plankton! And there's something I gotta get off my chest.  I'm worried that my evil laugh isn't evil enough.
After all, everyone knows that an evil villain needs an exceptionally evil laugh. So, I've been working on a few new options. Ahem.
That's good, but I really want a wild one.
Mmm. There might be something there, but let me try one more.
Wow, that is annoying. Oh well, I guess I'll just keep practicing and we'll see who laughs last. Whoa!
Okay, that's not funny! You haven't heard the last of me!
My Evil Genius Video Diary by Sheldon J. Plankton.  Greetings. It is I, Plankton!  I'm sorry. I'm not myself today.  It's just the world knows me as an evil villain...
...bent on destroying The Krusty Krab and stealing the Krabby Patty formula...  I've got your formula.  Yeeha!  ...but I'm so much more than that. Does anyone care about my hopes? My dreams? My secret passion for song?  That's right. I may have a mind of an evil genius, but I also have the voice of an angel.   Me. Me. Me.  Me.
Can your normal super villain do that? I don't think so!  Alas, the world is not ready for a talent like mine, but I'll get there some day.  You better watch your back, Justin Bottomfeeder.   "N" is for anywhere at anytime at all down here in the deep blue sea.  That's the stuff.
Yippee.
Where you can enjoy a nice helping of chum.  Oh, boy this is so...  ...good.
What? It's just an ordinary Krabby  Oh, my goodness!
What's the matter, man?
Relax, Eugene, there's nothing wrong as long as we use these inner-tubes!
Hold on.
Anytime, pal.
Actually, that's called standing, but close enough.
Well, the inside is done and ready for action.
Oh, uh, just this.  Bullies are so predictable.
Do the 'Loop Dee Loop.' Again. Again.  Zoom!
Again. Again.
Ouch!
Pickle?! I'm not a pickle, you...  Whoa! Careful, oaf!
This is the Jellyfish Trauma Center, dunce. What do you think hap
I'm allergic to Chrysanthemums!
Um, I could use a little help here.  Well, at least I'm safe from those savages.  Err, gah. Ohhh!  Oh, mommy. Not the eye!
Ha-ha, I like it.
Hey, watch where you're going you...
Ouch!  And now for the final touch.  Perfect! With this disguise, that formula is as good as mine.
That's it?  You'd better cough up that secret formula or else!
Krabs!
Krabs!
You can't do this to me, Krabs!  !  Ouch.
Your boss, your ruler, your master!
Oh, sweet domination. This is it!
It's that thick-headed Krabs! He'll ruin everything!
I'll never get that formula with that pest Krabs popping in and out like that. I've got it! I've been saving this for a rainy day.  It looks like an ordinary penny... because it  an ordinary penny! That fool Krabs is too greedy to ignore you, my little pretty.
But we did everything you said-- I followed all the rules! I even ate 105 black licorice jellybeans through a straw!
This is it, Plankton. Gently, now...
Coin-operated self-destruct? Not one of my better ideas.   Ouch.
Are you kidding me?!  That gigantic blowhard? "Ooh, look at me! I've got a nose on the top of my head." If anyone should be getting that prize, it's us.  Down here, weak-minded sponge!  If you're looking for the most important living creatures on the planet, well, here we are: plankton!
Do you doubt me: Sheldon J. Plankton?  Okay, take Cousin Marvin there. He may look like a dumb, tiny plant, and he is, but dumb Marvin has planktonic plant frames make up nearly half the oxygen you're breathing right now. And you thought rainforests were doing all the work. You love all this big stuff, don't you? That's why you watch all the fancy TV shows. Ooh, look at the cute penguins! They're just like us.  Yeah, laugh it up, Flippy, because none of that stuff would exist without plankton, like me. I'm a zooplankton, a tiny animal just like all these guys.  Hi, Mom! Mom! So, my friends and I, we eat the Dumb Marvins. Then, small fish eat us, bigger animals eat them all the way up the food chain. Even the blue whale, the biggest animal that's ever lived, usually likes nothing more than a great mouthful of stupid krill. What this means is no plankton, no sea life, no Krabby Patties, no sushi, no SpongeBob, that wouldn't be bad, no NOTHING!! Do we feel important to you now: the food you eat, the air you breathe? Come on, people!  All right! Hold on, I'm not finished. Crude oil, ancient dead plankton buried in the rocks. You'd be shrimped without that, right? Without all the driving, and the flying, and the electricity.  Ooh, look! You can see us from space. We win, WE WIN!!
Curses! It's not fair. Krabs is being interviewed by Perch Perkins, and I've never even had one customer!
Oh, Karen, my computer wife, if only I could have managed to steal the secret to Krabs' success, the formula for the Krabby Patty. Then people would line up to eat at my restaurant. Lord knows I've tried. I've exhausted every evil plan in my filing cabinet...from A to Y.
Yeah, A to Y. You know, the alphabet.
Z?
W, X, Y, Z. Plan Z! Here it is, just like you said.
Oh! Oh! Ohhh! It's evil. It's diabolical.  It's lemon-scented. This Plan Z can't  fail!  So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs, because by tomorrow, I'll have the formula. Then everyone will eat at the Chum Bucket, and I will rule the world! All hail Plankton. All hail Plank...!  Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Not in something, , you twit!
[] No, I am not on my way over  to the grand-opening ceremony. I'm busy planning to rule the world!
Stupid kid.
Time to put Plan Z into effect. Starting at the undersea castle of King Neptune.
I got it. I got it!
Plan Z. I love Plan Z.
Ding-a-ling. Hey there, old buddy.  Freeze. [] One secret formula to go, please. No, no, don't trouble yourself. I'll get it. []Well, I'd like to hang around, but I've got Krabby Patties to make... over at the Chum Bucket. Plan Z, I love ya!
Step right up. Plenty for everybody.
Anything for you, Perch.
Well, Perch, before my dear friend Eugene Krabs was frozen by King Neptune...  I'm sorry. He confided in me a secret wish. "Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence at the Chum Bucket," he said. "Don't let the flame die out."  By the way, act now and you get a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet with every purchase. Here you go, Perch.
Bucket helmets for everyone!
Karen, baby, I haven't felt this giddy since the day you agreed to be my wife.
Evil Plan Z is working perfectly. Nothing can stop me now!
Evil Plan Z is way ahead of you, baby. I've already hired someone to take care of those two. He's a vicious, cold-blooded predator!
That's right, Squidward.  And there's a free bucket helmet with every purchase. Care for one?
And what's that supposed to mean?
We'll see about that, Inspector Looselips.
Seize him, slaves!
Who can stop me now?! Who?!
Yeah.
Now, is that really necessary?
SpongeBob, please! Let's talk about this.
Bullseye!
Welcome to Air Plankton! Please put your seat backs and tray tables up as we're now approaching our final destination.
Potatoes?!
It's gonna take a lot more than potatoes to bring this baby down!  Or maybe not.
Well, Krabs, you're certainly in a pickle now!
You're welcome.
Mayo?! Well, it's gonna take a lot more than mayo to stop-
I'll take one secret formula...  ...to go.  Oh, barnacles! I'm out of gas?  Well, I'm not through yet. I've got something that will make you hand over that formula: something you can't resist.
Yes.  That's...that's...that's impossible!  Well, it  full of money just last week. Then I bought that airplane, and built that tank-
Well, Krabs, I guess you've won. I've spent every penny I've ever made trying to put you out of business...  ...except this one: my last penny.  Besides, what could I do with one measly cent, anyway?
Here.  Take it!  You've taken everything else. Why not?!
Cyclops to Laptop. Come in, Laptop.
Never mind. Maintain radio silence.  He-he, finally!  A pressure plate, eh, Krabs? Amateur hour.  Hmm...  Perfect.  Not a bad likeness.  Good enough to fool that idiot Krabs. Easy, easy.
Uh-oh.  That ain't good.
Come on, SpongeBob!  JOIN ME!! AND WE'LL BE RICH AND POWERFUL! ...  ...until I eventually betray you!  Uuh... JOIN ME!!
Wait a minute... Molecular deconstruction? I proved that to be a scientific impossibility 7 times!
I-I don't know! It just disappeared!
It's true!!
W-What are you gonna do, Krabs? Pour hot oil on me? Or put bamboo shoots under my nails?
Knock-Knock jokes? I can do this all day, Krabs.
Oh, boy. Who's there?
Jimmy who?
Well, that's stupid, but how is it torture?
Oh, make it stop, Krabs! MAKE IT STOP!!
Oh, thank you, Squidward!
I had it right in my greedy little mits, and then: poof! And now it's gone. Gone forever! Oh, I was so close to gaining the people's respect/fear.
Oh, when will my frustration/humiliation end?
Not now, Hun! I'm ranting/raving.  All right, what is it?
Oh...
You all look very hungry. Can I get anybody a Chumburger?
I told you, Krabs! I don't have it!
What's going on around here?
No, stop, don't!
Hmm... Get the secret formula, you say? Excuse me, I...need a moment. With that formula, I could rule the world!
Well, what do we do now?
What's a te-amwork?
Te-amwork.
Tie 'em work.
Tie 'em up.
Team.
Work.
Time bomb... work.
Hands in the middle? No, no, sounds idiotic. Besides, the two of us are no match for that cranky mob.  We could probably use a few more... te-am-works.
Wait, what are you doing?
Isn't that your house?
I don't know, SpongeBob.  What exactly does this clown bring to the te-am?
Come on, SpongeBob. Let's get out of here!
You got any other friends who aren't dim bulbs and nut jobs?
Revolting!
Why are you running?
Well, so much for your te-am.
We better get out of here until things cool off.
Well, yeah, looks like they're gonna have to change the name of Bikini Bottom to Dirty Bottom  right SpongeBob?
Yeah, yeah, too soon, huh?
Don't worry, SpongeBob. We'll find the secret formula and everything will go back to the way it was. You know, all happy and junk.  Now let's try and get some sleep.
There you are, feel comfy?
Good night, SpongeBob.
Good night, indeed.  That's right SpongeBob, sleep. You're hiding that formula in there somewhere.  Huh?  Well, here goes nothing.  Huh? What... is this place?
Ew! It's so sweet in here. I think my eyeball is getting a toothache.
So much sweetness! I think I'm gonna be sick.  Huh?
I'm sure it was nothing.  Now, go back to sleep.
What? No! That's crazy talk!
Because uh... because uh... okay, fine, I was in your brain.
What do you think I was doing? Looking for the secret formula.
Don't act so innocent! You know what I was up to. That's why you're pretending not to know the formula.
Hey, don't take it personally, I just assume everyone is lying.
Whatever.
MAYBE I DON'T WANNA BE ON A TE-AM! YOU THINK OF THAT?!
You're not gonna start singing, are you?  Oh, brother.
All right, you can put me down  Well,  that's one minute of my life I'll never get back.
Wait a minute, hold that thought.  Now back up.
Slow down.
Hmm. Yes.  SpongeBob, you're a genius!
If we build a time machine, we can go back to before the formula disappeared. Before society broke down. Before we became the hunted.
Well, first we'll need a computer powerful enough to calculate the intricacies of time travel.
Hmm.  There she is, my computer wife. They've got her tied up in the back room. I've never seen this many people at The Chum Bucket.
Now was that really necessary?
Oh, come on, really?
Hmm.
We'll never get in, the door's locked.
Okay. Wait a minute. No!
Ya there?
Why don't  boost  up instead?
Come on, SpongeBob, come on.
There's a guard over there, camera pans to show Patrick sleeping on a chair]  [Plankton sneaks over while mildly loud notes are played, Patrick yawns while changing his sleeping position. The notes are heard again, then the scene shows SpongeBob playing a tiny piano]  [whispering]
Now just reach over and grab it.
Stop! Pull it over his head!
Stop. Stop. Stop!  Let me get up there.  Help me.
Uh, uh. Once upon a time, there was a big, fat, pink idiot who went to sleep. The end!
Hey, baby, how are you?
Eh, I never had it, but we're going to get it. We're gonna go back in time and steal the formula before it disappeared.
You'll get used to it.
Sure. It's got everything we need. A photo booth, a cuckoo clock,  some day old chips. Now all we have to do is build it.  Oh, no, you don't.
Uh, I need it for the time machine.
Installed!  I did it!
Wait. We  do it. As a te-am.
Whatever.
Well, Karen. I know I've taken you for granted all these years and I... I just wanted to say... I'm glad you're on my te-am.
No, no, no, it's just one of the hazards of having a giant eyeball.  There's always stuff getting in there. Anyway,  where were we?  Say "cheese."
According to my calculations, the Krusty Krab should be right here.
According to my calculations, we've only gone 4 days into the future.
"Bubbles"?  Wha-what kind of a name is "Bubbles"?
What are you doing?
We don't even know what we're even watching for.
Okay, mine's moving.
No, this doesn't seem right. Should we call Bubbles?
I'm you from the future.
A team! All right, go get the formula.
We only came back from the day after tomorrow, dim wit.
No!
'Cause they don't make clothes in my size.
Something moronic?
Hey, hurry up over there!
Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get outta here.
Come on!
So  what teamwork is. All those years, I tried to make you mine and I finally did it. I mean,  did it!
You grabbed the wrong bottle!
You're the one who stole the wrong secret formula.
Of course you didn't! 'Cause you got cotton candy for brains!  No, seriously, he really does.
I  selfish and evil until you ruined everything with your teamwork!
YOU ARE THE WORST TEAMMATE EVER!!
Note to self: Never stow away in a gym sock.
I'll show  a happy ending.
Where do you think  going?
Hey, I'm just putting things back the way they were.
Oh, shrimp.
Everything works out.
Hahahaha!
You weak-minded fool!
Well, here it is, the Krusty Krab. The reasons of my nightmare and despair. Yep, it's SpongeBob SquareHead, my least favorite idiot.  Yuck.  Blecch, it's that squiddy thing with the tentacles. That guy creeps me out. Will you look at those 2 loafers? Disgusting. I tell you,  I never been to the Krusty Krab,  Open 24 hours a day, 7 days or weeks for the holidays in during disasters.  Krabs! Ugh, how I hate you! I bet he never hears me and I get the peace of my mind, brother. And I'd throw my mind into my brain so he can't see, and I'd get the Krabby Patty Formula for sure. He keeps it in the safe, you know. Show us the safe!   Yeah, they won't show you that. that's a big secret.
The beach?!  I hate this already. Nobody goes to the beach anymore. Eeh, I'm Eugene Krabs, Listen to him yammer on it's amazing he got past the 3rd grade the big dunce ...  Ooh! A Krabby Patty! I should be recording thisWhere did I put that camera?  Once again, foiled by my own brain. Thanks a lot, brain, you really came through!
Oh, yeah get to the talking squirrel thing. This is not entertainment. Go back to the Krabby Patty!  Nobody listens to me.
A pink shark? Oh, it's Patrick, the idiot best friend with that idiot SpongeBob who works with that idiot Krabs from the idiot Krusty Krab with that idiot safe... And the idiot secret formula waiting for idiot me to  Wait, that didn't come out right.
Yeah that's right, Capsize them. Look at that seastar, he got it on his face. That's unusual for an invertebrate.
just like mom used to make.
Well well well, it was only a matter of time, here comes the hippies.  The nerve of that sponge dragging the poor seaweed under the ground. doesn't he know there's algae living in there? Some of my best friends are algae.
Beach-combing, long-haired surf dimwits. Not my neighborhood, i'll tell ya that.
Boy, this story's keeping dumber and dumber, but i'm waiting for my wash cycle to end so I don't got anywhere to go. Nothing else on.
Om, I wish they'd show the Krabby Patty again, om..
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! They almost got nailed by those boards. Hey that's a good one, i'm gonna write that down. "Nailed, by, those, boards." That's pretty good. I'm writing a joke book full of zingers, stingers and one-liners, it's called "Plankton's Punch Lines." Here's another on, "If someone slips on a banana peel, you could say, well I guess he didn't find that a-peeling!"  It's the "peel" part that gets them. That's called a  That kind of wise-cracking makes everyone lose they're minds with laughter just so long enough so i can steal the formula. Speaking of which, How come they have a Krabby Patty in a while--
Okay that's not funny at all, this guy is sick. This guy needs a doctor and no one is doing anything about it. Those germs he's spraying are gonna get all over me, I can feel it. Then I'll be sick.
I've never seen that weirdo before in my life, what's his story? All I know is another idiot is getting more screen time me.
Oh this guy's a peace of work.
You tell him, octopus, he can't waste you're time like that! He's wasting my time, too.  Ugh, he snuck up on me there. Nice beard grandpa, why don't you tell me a bedtime story you old bottom-feeder?!
IT'S THE FLYING DUTCHMAN!!! Ooh, Krabs is gonna get it now, HAHAHAHAHA, Love it.
Yeah, yeah, let 'em have it, Dutchie! Give him a lightning bolt in the face!   Oh, now you're talking. What are you waiting for, ghost boob? Give Krabs the old heave-ho! Seriously, the Dutchman can't hear me.  Okay, look, if a powerful ghost can't destroy Krabs at his most desperate moment, what is this world coming to?! If I was in this scene, I would have Krabs on a spit by now, and I'd have the Krabby Patty in my hands.
Hahahahaha! Krabs' Cash Register goes bye-bye! Well, it's Sandy the do-gooder, doing good again. Oh, come on! She's gonna ruin everything. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! This is exciting just like a parade!
Wow, I didn't see that coming. Neither did he.
KRABS?!?!?!?! I thought he was destroyed.
Way to tick. I may just get my destruction after all.  Nice Special Effects! If I saw that in a dark alley I'd be scared. Yeah, eat him, eat all of them!  It taste weird but it's good for you! Actually, it will be good for me. No more SpongeBob, No more of his laughter, , No more Squidward, No more Patrick, No more Krabs and no more worries. I could start a new career and sell insurance, like my dad. Then everyone will love me.
Hey, what happened? What did I miss? I thought everyone was in peril! WHAT A CHIP!!!  Everybody's happy? Everybody's dancing? Everybody is there but me! How come I never get invited to these things? The invitation probably got lost in the mail-- You know, you try to turn everybody in the town into zombie slaves a couple of times, and they never let it go. This proves my scientific theory is correct, and that theory is, Anybody who's not me,  That one's for free, no charge. I'm gonna go smash some atoms, that'll cheer me up.
People seem a little more brotherly!
Ouch.
As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking.  You work for me now, SpongeBob!  Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet.
What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship?  I would!
This is your greatest blunder, Krabs! For 15 years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up! I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em!  I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs.
Ok, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty!
Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now  and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef!  So get cooking.
What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.
Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want.
Hi!
Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.
Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?
You got it!  Well it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?
Say no more, I'll take care of everything.  How about here?
How's this, SpongeBob?
Here?
Here?
Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Ok, go ahead, take it off!  It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!
Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?
So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?
You ready to make some patties?
How about those patties?
And then the littlest sea-elf said...  Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?
Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?
Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?
But I don't understand.  You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair.  I rubbed your putrid feet!
I command you to make me a patty this instant!
Don't back sass me!
What!?  That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges.  Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants...  I put the brain in the robot, you know. You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want, and I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!
What? What!?
Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!
I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.
Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!
It's a deal! I cheated anyway.
Thank you!  Ouch.
[first lines] Hear me Krabs. When I discover your formula for Krabby Patties, I'll run you out of business. I went to college!  Hey! Let me go!
You'll pay for this Krabs!
Psst... young man.  Yes, over here. Come on boy, a little closer.  Closer...  Not that close!  You blasted barnacle head! I mean... hi.
I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?
Acquaintances?
Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?
You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment.  Ding!  Sparkle, sparkle.
It's a gift! A gift from a friend.  Friends give each other gifts. And tomorrow is my birthday.  And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? .
Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you my friend, is one of those  tender... delicious... Krabby Patties!
Gee, and I thought you were stupid.
Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool!
SpongeBob, you will be mine!
It should be in here... but where?  Where? Oh...  This will be the beginning of the end!  Ouch! Stupid brain...  Come back here you swine!  That's it brain, you're going down!  Yes, yes, that's grand.  And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan.  And now it's time for a little wakey-uppy.
I have you now!
Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.
You pretentious little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste!
Nonsense. You never liked me anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party!
Toot toot! How about a little take-out?
You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!
Don't remind me. Brace yourself SpongeBob, this is my lab!  And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player?
No, no, no, no.  There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it.
Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula.  And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty.  This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants?
Mmm...
Steamy...
Yes... yes... YES!  Come to papa!  Oh boy...
Well, this stinks.
SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty!  Give it back, you porous freak! I command you! My patty!  Nooooo! I'll settle for some fries.
Then become part of the greatest musical sensation to ever hit Bikini Bottom.
Do instruments of torture count?
It's tremendous, you wanna see?
Correct!
Oh yeah?! Well, I smell...
Pew! He's right.
I love messing things up.
Are you ready to do or die, Krabs?
Good. Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick...
...your carapace!
That's where you're wrong, Krabs, for I too have a champion.
Ladies and gentlemen, turn your attention to the southwest corridor!
Other way!  Imbeciles.
And... stop! Perfect.
Representing the Chum Bucket, a creature so fearsome, so terrible, so mind-bendingly large, that those of you with weak constitutions may want to leave the stadium.
Too late! Ready or not, here he comes. Quake with fear, you mortal fools. Bow down before the awesome might of...
...this huge guy who is carrying the real contestant...
...Patrick Star!
He's not really your friend.
He's plotting your downfall right now!
Of course he would. Just look at him. Square: the shape of evil!
Then get mean!
Now get out there!
That...
Win this one because I told you to.
Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!
Better than you!
Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!
Don't forget, he called you pink!
Get back here and kill each other!
Ooh!  You're all mine you sweet Krabby Patty. Ooh hoo-hoo-hoo! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!  Initiating launch sequence.  Krabby Patty, here I come!
Reunited, and it's gonna feel so good!  D'oh!
Curse you, Mr. Krabs!  Ouch!
Oh, can it, computer wife. Can't you see I'm exhausted? Why don't you go make yourself useful and synthesize me up some grub?
What do we got here?  Oh, goody. Holographic meatloaf again! When am I gonna get some real food? Mr. Krabs gets to eat real food. Just look at his daughter, she's a big as a whale. I wish I could be successful like Mr. Krabs.  I wish I could somehow just switch lives with him. Just to know what it's like.
What a brilliant idea! Your parents must have been like, part computer or something.  Now, let's see here.  No...  no...  no...  A-ha!  Well, I hate to leave you, Karen, but you know what they say... a rolling stone gathers no algae!  Ahh...  Ugh... dear Neptune above, what happened last night? Huh, what's this?  Mister Plankton?  Who the Davey?  Ehh... I'm in the Krusty Krab... and that means the life switcher was a success! The Krusty Krab is mine!  Corporate casual!
At last!
Er, um, hey there, uh SpongeBob. Uh, SpongeBob?
I'm gonna need to take one of these Patties back to my office for um, bun inspection.
Why- why not?
The customer? I'll boil the customer in hot oil, and rip out his  I mean uh, yes, of course, for the lovely... customer.
Uhh... yes, uh, very nice. Um, thanks.  All mine, it's finally all mine! The Patties...  The wealth...  The notoriety! The...  SpongeBob, what do you want?
Review?
But I've never reviewed anything... except those foreign exercise videos my cousin sent me.
Eh, you're doing fine. Now leave me to my work.
I thought I sent you away, Cretin.
All right, the sauce.
The sauce. I don't know. You're using too much sauce, okay? Review's over.
What?
What's the matter with you? All I said was "A little too much sauce." It's no big deal, really.
What do you want from me, a promotion?
Uh, sure kid, you're uh... you're on register now.
Glad that's over.
So, have you two known each other long?  Huh?
So what do you want me to do about it?
Hope you like gray.
Now, no more intrusions! I'd like the begin writing the memoirs of my success story, so everyone just stay the
Just tell Daddy what you want! Oof! He's very busy!
If it'll get you out of my antennae.  Go crazy.
Ow!
Me?
In a cosmic sort of way, yes.
What? It's just an ordinary Krabby  Oh, my goodness! Squidward!
Oh, what now?
I command you to stop that. Stop that and return to your post!  Where's the off button on this thing?
Make it stop!  What, did I say the secret word?
Who's back? What?  What was that?
Take cover from what?!
What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me.
Krabs? What the barnacle is going on here?
That's terrible!
Good grief, he's naked!
I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?
It's not worth it! It's just not worth it! Goodbye, everyone. I'll remember you all in therapy.  Holographic meatloaf? My favorite!
Well, it's great to be back!  Huh?
What's this? Drops of rain frozen into ice crystals? I shall harness their energy and rule the world!  Ahh... oh, stop! I wish to rule you!
